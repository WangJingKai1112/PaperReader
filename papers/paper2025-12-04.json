    "abstract": "We investigated the occurrence rate of the sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun using Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data covering solar cycle (SC) 24 and the rising and maximum phases of SC 25. Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24, ~17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with >100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with >100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration > ~5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had >100 keV HXR bursts with duration > ~5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events. Halo CMEs, ground level enhancement (GLE) events, and intense geomagnetic storms are also consistent with a stronger SC 25."

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks."

A lightweight probability-weighted variant further incorporates the model's own token probabilities when available, outperforming different nine strong baselines.

    "abstract": "Ensuring the correctness of compiler optimizations is critical, but existing fuzzers struggle to test optimizations effectively. First, most fuzzers use optimization pipelines (heuristics-based, fixed sequences of passes) as their harness. The phase-ordering problem can enable or preempt transformations, so pipelines inevitably miss optimization interactions; moreover, many optimizations are not scheduled, even at aggressive levels. Second, optimizations typically fire only when inputs satisfy specific structural relationships, which existing generators and mutations struggle to produce. We propose targeted fuzzing of individual optimizations to complement pipeline-based testing. Our key idea is to exploit composition styles - structural relations over program constructs (adjacency, nesting, repetition, ordering) - that optimizations look for. We build a general-purpose, grammar-based mutational fuzzer, TargetFuzz, that (i) mines composition styles from an optimization-relevant corpus, then (ii) rebuilds them inside different contexts offered by a larger, generic corpus via synthesized mutations to test variations of optimization logic. TargetFuzz is adaptable to a new programming language by lightweight, grammar-based, construct annotations - and it automatically synthesizes mutators and crossovers to rebuild composition styles. No need for hand-coded generators or language-specific mutators, which is particularly useful for modular frameworks such as MLIR, whose dialect-based, rapidly evolving ecosystem makes optimizations difficult to fuzz. Our evaluation on LLVM and MLIR shows that TargetFuzz improves coverage by 8% and 11% and triggers optimizations 2.8$\\times$ and 2.6$\\times$, compared to baseline fuzzers under the targeted fuzzing mode. We show that targeted fuzzing is complementary: it effectively tests all 37 sampled LLVM optimizations, while pipeline-fuzzing missed 12."

    "abstract": "The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1"

For a given mass and electric charge, the model admits a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We demonstrate that, with an appropriate choice of coupling coefficients $α_n$, the central singularity is progressively mitigated as the correction order increases, ultimately resolving into a globally regular spacetime in the limit of infinite-order corrections. Furthermore, the criteria for the existence of extremal black holes are determined."

    "abstract": "Stellar streams offer one of the most sensitive probes of the Milky Way`s gravitational potential, as their phase-space morphology encodes both the tidal field of the host galaxy and the internal structure of their progenitors. In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \\textsc{\\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods."

    "abstract": "Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is fundamental to service computing, providing essential data-driven guidance for service selection and ensuring superior user experiences. However, prevalent approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), heavily rely on constructing explicit user--service interaction graphs. This dependency introduces severe scalability bottlenecks and limits performance when explicit connections are sparse or corrupted by noise. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that QoSDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the results highlight the framework's superior cross-dataset generalization capability and exceptional robustness against data sparsity and observational noise."

    "abstract": "One of the imminent science goals of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is the detection of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) emitted by an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). SMBHBs that cause CGWs with GW frequencies $f_\\mathrm{GW} > 10 \\text{nHz}$ have undergone significant orbital evolution, hence a change of $f_\\mathrm{GW}$ over time. In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable. However, using the realistic data set simulations, it was found that other configuration parameters of a PTA, such as the anisotropic distribution of pulsars and the effective number of pulsars in a PTA, can play a crucial role to the importance of this effect."

This relation has been shown to persist across various models of a galaxy's H I surface density profile. Using the Simba cosmological simulations, we investigate the robustness of this relation under different feedback prescriptions, including cases where specific feedback mechanisms are absent. While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements. We analyze the H I mass distributions of galaxies and demonstrate that, regardless of the feedback scenario, galaxies within a given H I mass bin exhibit outer H I radial profiles well approximated by an exponential function. Furthermore, the exponential decline rate remains remarkably similar across different physical prescriptions. We attribute the persistence of the H I mass-size relation to this inherent self-similarity in the H I mass distributions."

Unlike existing algorithms where the adjustment coefficient is always set to 1, we establish that the range of the adjustment coefficient lies within (1/2,1] for pseudo-convex optimization problems, and [0,1] for convex optimization problems. We also provide rigorous convergence proofs for these proposed algorithms.

For the sake of genericity, we formalize the grading of an order, a high-level operator that transforms a binary relation into another one, and we prove that grading an order preserves many of its properties, such as the monomial order property.

Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE.

    "abstract": "Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of video-language tasks. However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling."

Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

    "abstract": "Recent image diffusion transformers achieve high-fidelity generation, but struggle to generate images beyond these scales, suffering from content repetition and quality degradation. In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

    "abstract": "Inevitable specular highlights in practical environments severely impair the visual performance, thus degrading the task effectiveness and efficiency. Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Htcicv/MM-SHR."

    "abstract": "Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control."

We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \\& Mayor (1991) and Moe \\& Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \\& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts."

In this study, the Durbin-Hausman panel cointegration test is used to analyze the cointegration relationship between the variables and the Panel AMG estimator is used to estimate the long-run coefficients. The results of the AMG estimator show that military expenditures and industrial production index have a negative effect on sustainable development in NATO countries, while foreign direct investments have a positive effect. The impact of primary energy consumption is negative and less significant than the other negative impacts. The study also analyzes how the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. This analysis reveals the significant differences in the direction, significance, and coefficient size of the relationship among different countries. These findings suggest that the impact of military expenditures on sustainable development varies across countries. Therefore, countries should develop policies to ensure sustainable development by considering their specific dynamics."

Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups. This rings true for other niche quality checks where data's thin and know-how matters more than raw compute."

    "abstract": "The autonomous driving community is increasingly focused on addressing the challenges posed by out-of-distribution (OOD) driving scenarios. A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios. These results suggest a controllable and reliable pathway for scalable end-to-end driving."

However, a basic query persistently remains for the complex liquid metal system: Is there a minimal functional unit that can fully capture its diversity of morphology and function? Cells, as the most basic structural and functional units of life, are small in scale but have complex structures, functions, and life activities. Analogous to nature, this article proposes the concept of liquid metal cells, and systematically explores their construction routes, sensing capabilities, motion behaviors, and potential applications. We first construct a multi-phase composite structure with liquid metal as the nucleus, ionic solution as the cytoplasm, and polymer as the cell membrane by developing a layered cryogenic molding method. Furthermore, we reveal that liquid metal cells exhibit inherently versatile responsive characteristics and self-adaptive behaviors to thermal, pressure, chemical, electrical, and magnetic fields, indicating \"small world, vast potential\". Based on these fundamental findings, we finally demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing liquid metal cells as sensors, fluidic valves, and material transport carriers in flow channels through dynamic control."

In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications."

However, this reuse of prior designs also leads to similar vulnerabilities across multiple processors. As processors grow increasingly complex with iterative modifications, efficiently detecting vulnerabilities from modern processors is critical. Inspired by software fuzzing, hardware fuzzing has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting processor vulnerabilities. Yet, to our best knowledge, existing processor fuzzers fuzz each design individually, lacking the capability to understand known vulnerabilities in prior processors to fine-tune fuzzing to identify similar or new variants of vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present ReFuzz, an adaptive fuzzing framework that leverages contextual bandit to reuse highly effective tests from prior processors to fuzz a processor-under-test (PUT) within a given ISA. By intelligently mutating tests that trigger vulnerabilities in prior processors, ReFuzz effectively detects similar and new variants of vulnerabilities in PUTs. ReFuzz uncovered three new security vulnerabilities and two new functional bugs. ReFuzz detected one vulnerability by reusing a test that triggers a known vulnerability in a prior processor. One functional bug exists across three processors that share design modules. The second bug has two variants. Additionally, ReFuzz reuses highly effective tests to enhance efficiency in coverage, achieving an average 511.23x coverage speedup and up to 9.33% more total coverage, compared to existing fuzzers."

    "abstract": "As a challenging video editing task, movie trailer generation involves selecting and reorganizing movie shots to create engaging trailers. Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a \"selection-then-ranking\" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

    "abstract": "The repetition problem, where Large Language Models (LLMs) continuously generate repetitive content without proper termination, poses a critical challenge in production deployments, causing severe performance degradation and system stalling. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation and multiple practical solutions for the repetition problem encountered in real-world batch code interpretation tasks. We identify three distinct repetition patterns: (1) business rule generation repetition, (2) method call relationship analysis repetition, and (3) PlantUML diagram syntax generation repetition. Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases. The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation. Our main contributions include systematic theoretical analysis of repetition mechanisms, comprehensive evaluation of multiple solutions with task-specific applicability mapping, identification of early_stopping as the critical parameter for Beam Search effectiveness, and practical production-ready solutions validated in real deployment environments."

With the growing adoption of industrial automation, online bin packing has gained increasing attention. However, inconsistencies in problem settings, test datasets, and evaluation metrics have hindered progress in the field, and there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system. Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing. The benchmark comprises three carefully designed test settings and extends existing evaluation metrics with new metrics for structural stability and operational safety. We design a scoring system and derive a range of insights from the evaluation results. RoboBPP is fully open-source and is equipped with visualization tools and an online leaderboard, providing a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research and industrial applications (https://robot-bin-packing-benchmark.github.io)."

To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix.

Existing methods, including probit graphical models, struggle with modeling heterogeneity and selecting the number of subgroups effectively. We propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian framework using the Mixture of Finite Mixtures (MFM) approach to address these challenges. Our method allows for flexible subgroup discovery and models each subgroup with a probit graphical model, simultaneously estimating the number of clusters and their configurations. We develop an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm for inference, enabling robust estimation of cluster-specific structures and parameters.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a dual Riemannian alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving low-rank semidefinite programs with unit diagonal constraints. We recast the ADMM subproblem as a Riemannian optimization problem over the oblique manifold by performing the Burer-Monteiro factorization. Global convergence of the algorithm is established assuming that the subproblem is solved to certain optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm. It outperforms, by a significant margin, a few advanced SDP solvers (MOSEK, COPT, SDPNAL+, ManiSDP) in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on second-order SDP relaxations of dense and sparse binary quadratic programs."

    "abstract": "Sarcasm is common in online discussions, yet difficult for machines to identify because the intended meaning often contradicts the literal wording. In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators. Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest. Naive Bayes and logistic regression perform the strongest, achieving F1-scores around 0.57 for sarcastic comments. Although the lack of conversational context limits performance, the results offer a clear and reproducible baseline for sarcasm detection using lightweight and interpretable methods."

    "abstract": "Computing haplotypes from sequencing data, i.e. haplotype assembly, is an important component of foundational molecular and population genetics problems, including interpreting the effects of genetic variation on complex traits and reconstructing genealogical relationships. Assembling the haplotypes of polyploid genomes remains a significant challenge due to the exponential search space of haplotype phasings and read assignment ambiguity; the latter challenge is particularly difficult for polyploid haplotype assemblers since the information contained within the observed sequence reads is often insufficient for unambiguous haplotype assignment in polyploid genomes. We present pHapCompass, probabilistic haplotype assembly algorithms for diploid and polyploid genomes that explicitly model and propagate read assignment ambiguity to compute a distribution over polyploid haplotype phasings. We develop graph theoretic algorithms to enable statistical inference and uncertainty quantification despite an exponential space of possible phasings. Since prior work evaluates polyploid haplotype assembly on synthetic genomes that do not reflect the realistic genomic complexity of polyploidy organisms, we develop a computational workflow for simulating genomes and DNA-seq for auto- and allopolyploids. Additionally, we generalize the vector error rate and minimum error correction evaluation criteria for partially phased haplotypes. Benchmarking of pHapCompass and several existing polyploid haplotype assemblers shows that pHapCompass yields competitive performance across varying genomic complexities and polyploid structures while retaining an accurate quantification of phase uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) constructs classifiers using both labelled and unlabelled data. It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed. This improvement arises particularly when class overlap is moderate, labelled data are sparse, and the missingness is informative. Modelling such informative missingness thus offers a coherent statistical framework that unifies likelihood-based inference with the behaviour of empirical SSL methods."

    "abstract": "In sparse LU factorization, nonzero elements after symbolic factorization tend to distribute in diagonal and right-bottom region of sparse matrices. However, regular 2D blocking on this non-uniform distribution structure may lead to workload imbalance across blocks. Besides, existing matrix features fail to guide us effectively in blocking. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware irregular blocking method for numerical factorization. A novel diagonal block-based feature is introduced to effectively characterize the local nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose an irregular blocking method that adjusts block sizes according to the local distribution of nonzeros. The strategy utilizes fine-grained blocks in dense regions and coarse-grained blocks in sparse regions, adequately balancing the nonzeros of blocks both within the same level and across levels in the dependency tree. Experiments demonstrate that, on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, our proposed irregular blocking method achieves average speedups of 1.50x and 3.32x over PanguLU and the latest SuperLU_DIST, respectively. In addition, it achieves speedups of 1.40x and 3.84x over PanguLU and SuperLU_DIST on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs."

This limitation stems from the low dynamic compliance of the modes they employ$\\unicode{x2013}$typically Lamb or Rayleigh modes$\\unicode{x2013}$which restricts their maximum achievable particle velocity. This work presents a piezoelectric microacoustic device that overcomes this fundamental constraint by harnessing a topological interface state at the boundary between two microscale metamaterial structures.

This enables record-high particle velocities (>51 m/s) never reached, due to material limits, by any previously demonstrated piezoelectric gyroscope."

Small modulus worm gear and worm are taken by the mechanism, in order to realize compact structure, high stiffness, the unidirectional 360 degrees rotation and reverse self-locking function. The precision, stiffness, mechanical properties and reliability of the mechanism are analyzed in the paper. The results show that the position accuracy of the filter wheel can meet the requirement of 0.5mm. The first order modal of the mechanism is 313Hz. The results of vibration test indicate that stiffness, dynamic performance and reliability of the mechanism can be meet. Therefore, the design of filter wheel in this paper can ensure the multi-spectral imaging requirements under complex spatial conditions."

In this work, we study the sDFT with a plane-wave discretization, and discuss variance reduction algorithms in the framework of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In particular, we show that the density matrix evaluation in sDFT can be decomposed into many levels by increasing the plane-wave cutoffs or the Chebyshev polynomial orders. This decomposition renders the computational cost independent of the discretization size or temperature.

    "abstract": "As the frequency and complexity of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to increase, the level of threats posed to Smart Internet of Things (SIoT) business environments have also increased. These environments generally have several interconnected SIoT systems and devices that are integral to daily operations, usually depending on cloud infrastructure and real-time data analytics, which require continuous availability and secure data exchange. Conventional detection mechanisms, while useful in static or traditional network environments, often are inadequate in responding to the needs of these dynamic and diverse SIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel trust-based DDoS detection model tailored to meet the unique requirements of smart business environments. The proposed model incorporates a trust evaluation engine that continuously monitors node behaviour, calculating trust scores based on packet delivery ratio, response time, and anomaly detection. These trust metrics are then aggregated by a central trust-based repository that uses inherent trust values to identify traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks. By integrating both trust scores and central trust-based outputs, the trust calculation is enhanced, ensuring that threats are accurately identified and addressed in real-time. The model demonstrated a significant improvement in detection accuracy, and a low false-positive rate with enhanced scalability and adaptability under TCP SYN, Ping Flood, and UDP Flood attacks. The results show that a trust-based approach provides an effective, lightweight alternative for securing resource-constrained business IoT environments."

Using abductive qualitative analysis, we developed an expert-guided taxonomy of generative AI risks across seven categories: (1) providing generalized health advice; (2) encouraging disordered behaviors; (3) supporting symptom concealment; (4) creating thinspiration; (5) reinforcing negative self-beliefs; (6) promoting excessive focus on the body; and (7) perpetuating narrow views about eating disorders. Our results demonstrate how certain user interactions with generative AI systems intersect with clinical features of eating disorders in ways that may intensify risk. We discuss implications of our work, including approaches for risk assessment, safeguard design, and participatory evaluation practices with domain experts."

The framework enables consistent experimentation and comparison across diverse causality-based attack and defense methods. Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation. Our results reveal that: (1) targeted interventions on causally critical components can reliably modify safety behavior; (2) safety-related mechanisms are highly localized (i.e., concentrated in early-to-middle layers with only 1--2\\% of neurons exhibiting causal influence); and (3) causal features extracted from our framework achieve over 95\\% detection accuracy across multiple threat types. By bridging theoretical causality analysis and practical model safety, our framework establishes a reproducible foundation for research on causality-based attacks, interpretability, and robust attack detection and mitigation in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Amadeuszhao/SOK_Casuality."

We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of adversarially robust, interpretable mixed-authorship detection, with implications for trust and oversight in human-AI co-authorship."

    "abstract": "Existing methods for deepfake detection aim to develop generalizable detectors. Although \"generalizable\" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data."

But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as \"Why was this generator not dispatched?\" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable."

We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability."

L 98-59 is an M3 dwarf hosting six Earth-like planets, with two of them in the habitable zone of the star. X-ray observations made in 2020 and 2021 detected significant flares above a quiescent luminosity of 4-10 x 10^26 erg/s. We present the results from two short XMM-Newton observations of L 98-59, which are part of a monitoring survey to detect long-term X-ray variability and activity cycles. In October 2024 the X-ray quiescent luminosity of the star was about 5.9 x 10^25 erg/s, and it was about 6.3 x 10^26 erg/s in February 2025. We speculate that in late 2024 the star had a minimum of activity; in 2021 the star was near a maximum of an activity cycle, and in 2025 it was at the middle of the cycle. We suggest a coarse estimate of the period of about 2 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10, which is the highest among the stars with a known X-ray cycle other than the Sun. We also infer that even the outer planet in the habitable zone, L 98-59f, is exposed to an X-ray dose between 100 and 1600 times the X-ray irradiation of the Earth in the XMM band."

Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures."

    "abstract": "The initial-to-final-state inverse problem consists in determining a quantum Hamiltonian assuming the knowledge of the state of the system at some fixed time, for every initial state. We formulated this problem to establish a theoretical framework that would explain the viability of data-driven prediction in quantum mechanics. In a previous work, we analysed this inverse problem for Hamiltonians of the form $-Δ+ V$ with an electric potential $V = V({\\rm t}, {\\rm x})$, and we showed that uniqueness holds whenever the potentials are bounded and decay super-exponentially at infinity. In this paper, we extend this result for unbounded potentials. One of the key steps consists in proving a family of suitable Strichartz estimates -- including the corresponding endpoint of Keel and Tao. In the context of the inverse Calderón problem this family of inequalities corresponds to the Carleman inequality proved by Kenig, Ruiz and Sogge. Haberman showed that this inequality can be also retrieved as an embedding of a suitable Bourgain space. The corresponding Bourgain space in our context do not capture the mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces of Strichartz inequalities. In this paper, we give a counterexample that justifies this fact, and shows the limitations of Bourgain spaces to address the initial-to-final-state inverse problem."

Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion."

    "abstract": "AI agent-based systems are becoming increasingly integral to modern software architectures, enabling autonomous decision-making, dynamic task execution, and multimodal interactions through large language models (LLMs). However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints."

Those are whose energy demand best fit certain target profiles, which usually depend on generation or cost policies. But, even when the demand profile is available, it is in an anonymous way, preventing its association to a particular client. In this paper, we explore a large dataset containing several millions of monthly demand profiles in Spain and use the available information about the associated economic sector and location for an indirect identification of the customers. The distance of the demand profile from the target is used to define a key performance indicator (KPI) which is used as the main driver of the proposed marketing strategy. The combined use of activity and location has been revealed as a powerful tool for indirect identification of customers, as 100,000 customers are uniquely identified, while about 300,000 clients are identifiable in small sets containing 10 or less consumers. To assess the proposed marketing strategy, it has been compared to the random attraction of new clients, showing a reduction of distance from the target of 40% for 10,000 new customers."

This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions.

    "abstract": "Explanatory Interactive Learning (XIL) is a powerful interactive learning framework designed to enable users to customize and correct AI models by interacting with their explanations. In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches. More broadly, our work contributes to the ongoing efforts for understanding human factors in AI."

By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials."

The lecture notes systematically introduce the fundamental concepts, modeling components, and theoretical foundations of regression analysis, covering linear regression, logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, polynomial regression, basis-function models, kernel-based methods, and neural-network-based nonlinear regression. Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables. By bridging classical statistical modeling and modern machine-learning practice, these lecture notes aim to equip students with a solid conceptual and technical foundation for further study in advanced artificial intelligence models."

While recent advances in language models have shown promise in this direction, existing solutions often rely on large-scale closed-source models that suffer from high inference costs, limited transparency, and lack of adaptability for lightweight deployment. In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in bridging natural language and structured query languages within schema-rich geospatial environments."

We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $< 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3~au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere."

Here, we focus on the regularity of this map as a function of the density and the coupling constant in front of the interaction term. More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength. As a consequence, we obtain a holomorphic extension of the universal constrained-search functional to a suitable subset of complex-valued densities. This partially extends the DFT framework to non-self-adjoint Schrödinger operators. As further applications of these results, we also establish the existence of an exchange-only part of the exchange-correlation potential, and justify the Görling-Levy perturbation expansion for the correlation energy."

    "abstract": "Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm."

The emergent random networks support geodesics with a wandering exponent $ξ= 1/2$, and a travel-time fluctuation exponent $χ= 0$, consistent with the KPZ relation, yet violating the bound~$χ\\geq1/8$ predicted in the Poissonian framework. Transverse deviations follow the Kolmogorov distribution, indicating similarities between Brownian bridge excursions and geodesics in a random medium with correlated edges orientations. These results reveal a new universality class of Euclidean first-passage percolation, where local orientational memory reshapes transport properties and challenges existing bounds for random spatial networks."

    "abstract": "This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility."

Our approach relies on analysis of regularity and asymptotic properties, near the boundary of the spatio-temporal domain, of closed-form integral-representation formulae derived via complex-analytic techniques and rigorous implementation of the modern PDE technique known as Fokas unified transform method. In order to elucidate the novel idea and demonstrate the proposed technique in a self-contained fashion, we explicitly present its application to two concrete examples, namely the heat equation and the linear KdV equation with Dirichlet data. New uniqueness theorems for these two models are also presented herein."

The characteristic thickness of such regions decreases exponentially with time, while the other two dimensions do not change considerably, making the flow near each pancake strongly anisotropic. The pancakes emerge in increasing number with time, which may enhance the anisotropy of the flow, especially if they orient similarly in space. In the present paper, we study numerically the local isotropy of the flow by analyzing the evolution of the so-called isotropy markers [Phys. Rev. Fluids 10, L022602 (2025)]. We show that these functions drift slowly towards unity, indicating the process of slow isotropization, which takes place without the viscous scales getting exited and despite the similar orientation of the emerging pancakes."

Here, we investigate the energy equality related to a suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes initial boundary value problem. The term suitable is meant in the sense that for our goals we achieve a weak solution whose existence is based as limit of solutions to the mollified Navier-Stokes system. In the case of a weak regularity of the solution, our results justify the possible gap for the energy equality in terms of \"kinetic energy\". However, if there is a sufficient regularity, e.g., like the continuity of the L2-norm of the weak solution, then the energy equality holds."

The received understanding of speech movements as discrete, goal-oriented actions struggles to make contact with the rhythmicity findings. In this work, we demonstrate that an unintuitive -- but no less principled than the conventional -- representation for discrete movements reveals a pervasive limit cycle organization and unlocks the recovery of previously inaccessible rhythmic structure underlying the motor activity of speech. These results help resolve a time-honored tension between the ubiquity of biological rhythmicity and discreteness in speech, the quintessential human higher function, by revealing a rhythmic organization at the most fundamental level of individual articulatory actions."

Due to the lack of boundary regularity, we also have to be careful while proving that the first solution found is a local minimizer in the proper topology."

    "abstract": "Generative AI tools, such as AI-generated hints, are increasingly integrated into programming education to offer timely, personalized support. However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pairing AI-generated hints with reflection prompts, asking students to review and analyze their learning, when they request hints. This study investigates the interplay between AI-generated hints and different designs of reflection prompts in an online introductory programming course. We conducted a two-trial field experiment. In Trial 1, students were randomly assigned to receive prompts either before or after receiving hints, or no prompt at all. Each prompt also targeted one of three SRL phases: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. In Trial 2, we examined two types of prompt guidance: directed (offering more explicit and structured guidance) and open (offering more general and less constrained guidance). Findings show that students in the before-hint (RQ1), planning (RQ2), and directed (RQ3) prompt groups produced higher-quality reflections but reported lower satisfaction with AI-generated hints than those in other conditions. Immediate performance did not differ across conditions. This negative relationship between reflection quality and hint satisfaction aligns with previous work on student mental effort and satisfaction. Our results highlight the need to reconsider how AI models are trained and evaluated for education, as prioritizing user satisfaction can undermine deeper learning."

    "abstract": "Molecules play a crucial role in biomedical research and discovery, particularly in the field of small molecule drug development. Given the rapid advancements in large language models, especially the recent emergence of reasoning models, it is natural to explore how a general-purpose language model can be efficiently adapted for molecular science applications. In this work, we introduce BioMedGPT-Mol, a molecular language model designed to support molecular understanding and generation tasks. By curating and unifying existing public instruction datasets, we have assembled a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality training dataset. The model is then fine-tuned through a meticulously designed multi-task learning framework. On a consolidated benchmark derived from LlaSMol, TOMG-Bench, and MuMOInstruct, BioMedGPT-Mol achieves remarkable performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that a general-purpose reasoning model can be effectively and efficiently post-trained into a professional molecular language model through a well-structured multi-task curriculum. Leveraging the power of it, we further explore retrosynthetic planning task, and the performance on RetroBench demonstrates its competitive capability of acting as an end-to-end retrosynthetic planner. We anticipate that our approach can be extended to other biomedical scientific domains."

In this work, we derive formulas for the $mα^5$ QED contribution that are valid up to the second order in $m/M$, and perform its calculation for the $^3$He$-$$^4$He isotope shift, leading to an improved determination of the nuclear charge-radius difference."

    "abstract": "Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

    "abstract": "Hallucinations are a key concern when creating applications that rely on Foundation models (FMs). Understanding where and how these subtle failures occur in an application relies on evaluation methods known as \\textit{evals}. Prior work focuses on defining new eval methods or benchmark datasets for specific tasks. However, neither helps a software team with a task-specific FM application when there is no metric or dataset. The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\\% and 90\\% accuracy respectively. Our research tackles a growing problem facing engineering teams, how to evaluate and review outputs from FM tasks."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings."

With its fast spin and unusually low magnetic field, this NS has evidently experienced unusual evolution, likely connected with its high mass, which is now $2.5σ$ above that of the heaviest pulsar with a white dwarf companion, as measured by Shapiro delay techniques. By tightening the mass measurement, we also raise the maximum (commonly called Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) NS mass to $M_{\\rm TOV} > 2.27\\,M_\\odot$$(2.12\\,M_\\odot)$ at $1σ$$(3σ)$ confidence, which improves bounds on the dense-matter equation of state.

    "abstract": "In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of 2-adic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$."

This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles."

We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public. Experiments show that our model achieves robust real-world 4D control across diverse timing patterns and camera trajectories, while preserving high generation quality and outperforming prior work in controllability.

    "abstract": "Personal language model-based agents are becoming more widespread for completing tasks on behalf of users; however, this raises serious privacy questions regarding whether these models will appropriately disclose user data. While prior work has evaluated language models on data-sharing scenarios based on general privacy norms, we focus on personalizing language models' privacy decisions, grounding their judgments directly in prior user privacy decisions. Our findings suggest that general privacy norms are insufficient for effective personalization of privacy decisions. Furthermore, we find that eliciting privacy judgments from the model through In-context Learning (ICL) is unreliable to due misalignment with the user's prior privacy judgments and opaque reasoning traces, which make it difficult for the user to interpret the reasoning behind the model's decisions. To address these limitations, we propose ARIEL (Agentic Reasoning with Individualized Entailment Logic), a framework that jointly leverages a language model and rule-based logic for structured data-sharing reasoning. ARIEL is based on formulating personalization of data sharing as an entailment, whether a prior user judgment on a data-sharing request implies the same judgment for an incoming request. Our experimental evaluations on advanced models and publicly-available datasets demonstrate that ARIEL can reduce the F1 score error by $\\textbf{39.1%}$ over language model-based reasoning (ICL), demonstrating that ARIEL is effective at correctly judging requests where the user would approve data sharing. Overall, our findings suggest that combining LLMs with strict logical entailment is a highly effective strategy for enabling personalized privacy judgments for agents."

It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt. Our model is calibrated using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data from several countries, including the United States, China, France, and Denmark. Our results confirm that the correlation between cumulative debt, cumulative GDP, and cumulative emissions remains strong, regardless of the political structure of credit. In our current financial system, credit expansion amplifies GDP growth and associated emissions, thereby locking economies into higher cumulative carbon trajectories, even as energy efficiency improves through innovation."

A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise."

    "abstract": "In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality."

The first part of the book focuses on finite point sets. The most important result is a complete and continuous classification of all finite clouds of unordered points under rigid motion in any Euclidean space. The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points. The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe."

While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks. Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/nicolashoudre/RAMEN."

Despite these advantages, the practical integration of such microstructures into functional devices remains challenging. Fabrication processes are often complex and prone to stochastic effects, such as unwanted pinning and thermal-induced instabilities, which limit device reliability and scalability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing spintronic neuromorphic architectures toward real-world applications. Thus, to reduce these effects we have proposed a design which is experimentally feasible and require less energy as compared to existing one. By engineering the system anisotropy into a sawtooth-type energy landscape, we have achieved free flow of these microstructures and successfully emulated integrate and fire (IF) function of biological neuron. Thus, proposed design presents an experimentally reliable and energy efficient external stimuli approach for tailoring magnetic microstructures dynamic behaviours, resulting in low energy consumption of 23.66 fJ per spike paving the way for the development of skyrmion-based futuristic neuromorphic computing device applications."

Here, we present a 50 GHz repetition rate carrier-envelope offset estabilised millimetre-wave baseband comb source covering the sub-terahertz region, generated from an optical microcomb source. Our microresonator-filtered microcomb enables direct, coherent downconversion via photoconductive antennas, even without external amplification. The metrological-grade optical soliton source produces single-cycle, naturally zero carrier-envelope offset millimetrewave baseband combs. It supports time-domain spectroscopy without any need to temporally align the source and detection pulses, as the ultra-high phase coherence allows significant differences between the optical paths of the source and detection pulses, which we tested over 8m, finding no degradation even in freerunning operation. Finally, the multisoliton operation regime provides a simple way of spectrally tailoring the microwave output by selecting different optical soliton states."

In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between."

VANICP is a recently published acceleration framework that significantly improves the computational efficiency of point-cloud-based applications. By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

In this study, 18 participants observed stimuli displayed in two conditions during the experiment: text-only (e.g., `Hit with a hammer') and video+text (visual clips with matching phrases). EEG data were recorded from 32 channels and analyzed for event-related potentials and source localization using LORETA, which identified four left-hemisphere regions of interest: the Lateral Occipital Cortex (LOC), Posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (pSTG), Ventral Premotor Cortex (PMv), and Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL). A space of dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was constructed with driving inputs to LOC and pSTG, and multiple connectivity configurations were tested. Bayesian Model Selection revealed a dominant model in which PMv causally influenced IPL and pSTG, reflecting a feedforward architecture from affordance-related motor regions to semantic hubs. Bayesian Model Averaging further confirmed strong endogenous connections from LOC to PMv and IPL, and significant modulation from PMv to IPL. These findings provide direct evidence that affordance processing in premotor regions drives action language understanding by engaging downstream parietal and temporal areas. The results support grounded cognition theories and offer a mechanistic account of how sensorimotor information contributes to linguistic comprehension."

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles."

    "abstract": "The portion of the gravitational energy absorbed by the black hole due to the radial infall of a point mass is known to diverge at leading order in perturbation theory. This divergence is an artifact of the point-particle model, where the contribution of each multipole to the total absorbed energy is observed to be roughly constant. We show explicitly that this divergent energy arises from the infinite energy present in the singular static field arbitrarily close to the point mass, which also flows into the black hole when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon. We perform a multipole decomposition of the linearized gravitational field generated by the point mass near its world line at the black hole horizon. By applying the standard field-theoretical approach to the particle field, we compute the corresponding partial energy and find that it matches the constant multipole contribution."

    "abstract": "Variable Stiffness Actuators prove invaluable for robotics applications in unstructured environments, fostering safe interactions and enhancing task adaptability. Nevertheless, their mechanical design inevitably results in larger and heavier structures compared to classical rigid actuators. This paper introduces a novel 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) parallel wrist that achieves variable stiffness through redundant elastic actuation. Leveraging its parallel architecture, the device employs only four motors, rendering it compact and lightweight. This characteristic makes it particularly well-suited for applications in prosthetics or humanoid robotics. The manuscript delves into the theoretical model of the device and proposes a sophisticated control strategy for independent regulation of joint position and stiffness. Furthermore, it validates the proposed controller through simulation, utilizing a comprehensive analysis of the system dynamics. The reported results affirm the ability of the device to achieve high accuracy and disturbance rejection in rigid configurations while minimizing interaction forces with its compliant behavior."

    "abstract": "In 2024, France was shaken by the far-right National Rally's victory in the European elections. In response to this unprecedented result, French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, triggering legislative elections just two weeks later. A whirlwind campaign followed, partly on social media, as is now the norm, and concluded with the victory of a left-wing coalition. This article examines the YouTube activity of two key actors during this period, news media and politicians, and the commenting behavior they generated. We built a dataset of 35 news media channels, 28 politicians and parties channels, 43.5k videos posted from three months before the European elections to one week after the second round of the legislative elections, and 7.4M associated comments. We examined upload activity and engagement across political orientations and used network analysis methods to uncover the structure of their commenting communities. We also identified politicians' appearances on news media channels and assessed their impact on commenting user bases. Our findings show that, among politicians and parties channels, far-right and left-wing ones were significantly more active and received substantially higher engagement (views, likes, and comments) than other groups, with denser and more clustered commenting communities. About 7% of commenters commented across political orientations and were much more active than in-group commenters. News media channels tended to favor politically aligned guests, while centrist politicians were over-represented. Finally, politicians' presence in the videos of a specific news media channel increased the share of commenters who were active on this channel and political channels, regardless of their orientation."

    "abstract": "Standard Vision Transformers flatten 2D images into 1D sequences, disrupting the natural spatial topology. While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure."

Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations."

We present a simulator that achieves both fidelity and speed by focusing on the critical, yet overlooked, component of simulation: the photon count statistics. Our key contribution is a Markov-renewal process (MRP) formulation that, for the first time, analytically predicts the mean and variance of registered photon counts under dead time. To make this MRP model computationally tractable, we introduce a spectral truncation rule that efficiently computes the complex covariance statistics. By proving the shift-invariance of the process, we extend this per-pixel model to full histogram cube generation via a precomputed lookup table. Our method generates 3D cubes indistinguishable from the sequential gold-standard, yet is orders of magnitude faster. This finally enables large-scale, physically-faithful data generation for learning-based SP-LiDAR reconstruction."

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64."

    "abstract": "Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves."

A Lyapunov-based analysis yields a sufficient stability condition, leading to an adaptive dead-zone rule that suspends parameter updates when the innovation exceeds a stability bound. Applied to an electrochemical battery model, SG-DKF achieves accuracy comparable to a dual EKF and reduces state of charge RMSE by over 45% under large initial state errors."

Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings."

We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance. Further, we analyze the excess noise contributions from relative WFEs in the context of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where our findings suggest that if future CV-QKD implementations employ wavefront correction algorithms similar to those reported here, an order of magnitude increase in secure key rates may be forthcoming."

If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries."

These spectra were carefully reduced, including rigorous absolute flux calibration, yielding detections of ~410-800 emission lines in each PN. Plasma diagnostics and abundance calculations were critically performed using nebular lines. In all three PNe, the electron temperatures derived using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) are higher than those yielded by the HI Balmer and Paschen jumps, while the temperatures yielded by the OII and NII optical recombination lines (ORLs) are very low, <2000 K, indicating that the heavy-element ORLs probe cold nebular regions. The ORL abundances of N, O and Ne are systematically higher than the corresponding CEL values, confirming high ADFs in the three objects. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams were created, and spatio-kinematical studies show that CELs come from the outer nebular regions, while the ORL-emitting regions are close to nebular center. Additionally, the velocity indicated by CEL line-splitting decreases with ionization potential, which was not obvious in ORLs. These spatial and kinematic differences support two distinct components of ionized gas: a cold, metal-rich component and a warmer component with normal metallicity. Heavy elements are strongly enriched in the cold gas, while its H^+ fraction is low but still produces significant HI emission, affecting CEL abundance estimates."

In the present work, we develop a special truncation within this approach, which leads to a tractable set of functional equations that satisfy the fundamental chiral Ward-Takahashi identities. Specifically, the truncation allows us to simplify considerably the quark-gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation, without significant loss of quantitative accuracy. Importantly, this implies a substantial reduction of complexity of the renormalized Bethe-Salpeter equation: it is composed by a pair of one-loop diagrams that contain the full quark-gluon vertex, and a single two-loop diagram that is instrumental for the masslessness of the pion in the chiral limit. A detailed numerical analysis reveals that the incorporation of the aforementioned two-loop diagram is instrumental for the corresponding eigenvalue to reach unity. The key relation between the quark mass function and the pion wave function is shown to be satisfied to within the numerical precision of the loop integrals, which is at the level of about one percent or better. The field-theoretic ingredients required for the extension of this analysis beyond the chiral limit are briefly discussed."

While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for the all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $γ_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case."

    "abstract": "We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions."

    "abstract": "The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating \"permutation defects\" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, powered by large language models and reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation. Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks."

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control."

We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation.

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control."

These galaxies are characterized by their high star formation rates and substantial infrared luminosities. The formation mechanisms remain an open question for these galaxies, particularly with respect to how such intense levels of star formation are triggered and maintained. We aim to resolve CO(3-2) emission toward two strongly lensed galaxies, SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50, at z~2.5-2.8 to determine their morphology and physical properties. We used high-resolution ALMA band 3 observations of CO(3-2) emission toward both sources to investigate their properties. We performed parametric and nonparametric lens modeling using the publicly available lens modeling software PyAutoLens. We divided the CO(3-2) emission line into two bins corresponding to the red and blue portions of the emission line and nonparametrically modeled the source plane emission for both bins. We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution. Given the lack of evidence of ongoing interactions or mergers in our source plane models, we suggest that the intense star formation was triggered by a recent interaction and/or merger. We also consider the possibility that these galaxies might be in the process of settling into disks."

We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation."

New technologies under development are also discussed, including mmWave radar, and vibration based techniques.

By comparing tradeoffs between sensing modalities, the survey highlights the technical and design factors that shape interactive surface performance and user experience.

Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $μ_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s>1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime."

However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a \"learning to learn\" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era."

Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ > 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution."

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models achieve impressive reasoning capabilities with long Chain of Thoughts, but they incur substantial computational cost during inference, and this motivates techniques to improve the performance-cost ratio. Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy."

The two paths are trained jointly and their outputs are combined to produce the final GRF/GRM predictions. Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset.

    "abstract": "Radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising mechanism for powering disc winds from accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \\sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}$ and yielding $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models. They can also reprocess a significant fraction of the disc luminosity and thus dramatically modify the broad-band optical/UV SED. Given that theory and observations indicate that disc winds are intrinsically inhomogeneous, clumping offers a physically motivated solution. Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs."

We propose a computationally tractable method to estimate the quantile function of the discrepancy between the simulated and ground-truth outcome distributions. Our approach focuses on output uncertainty and treats the simulator as a black box, imposing no modeling assumptions on its internals, and hence applies broadly across many parameter families, from Bernoulli and multinomial models to continuous, vector-valued settings. The resulting quantile curve supports confidence interval construction for unseen scenarios, risk-aware summaries of sim-to-real discrepancy (e.g., VaR/CVaR), and comparison of simulators' performance. We demonstrate our methodology in an application assessing LLM simulation fidelity on the WorldValueBench dataset spanning four LLMs."

We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations. Given that Magnus amplitudes are free of hyper-classical terms, and the known relations between Magnus amplitudes and the radial action, our results lay the groundwork for systematic and efficient calculations of classical observables from quantum field theory."

Above the surface both fields are in good approximation harmonic vector fields determined by their values at the body's surface or any other surface enclosing the body. The intensity problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields vanishing at infinity and with prescribed intensity of the field at the surface. This problem constitutes a nonlinear boundary value problem, whose general solvability is not yet established. In this paper {\\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields ${\\bf H}$ outside the unit sphere $S^2$ are studied and, given an axisymmetric Hölder continuous intensity function $I\\neq 0$ on $S^2$, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the intensity problem is proved. These solutions can more precisely be characterized as follows: fix a number $\\de \\in \\nat\\setminus \\{1 \\}$ and a meridional plane $M$ through the symmetry axis $S\\!A$, and in $M$ a unit circle $S^1$ (symmetric with respect to $S\\!A$) and, furthermore, $2\\, N$, $N \\in \\nat_0$, points $z_n \\in M$ (symmetric with respect to $S\\!A$, avoiding $S\\!A$, and outside $S^1$), then the existence of an (up to a sign) unique harmonic field ${\\bf H}$ is established that vanishes at (the axisymmetric circles piercing $M$ at) $z_n$ and nowhere else, that has intensity $I$ at $S^2$ and (exact) decay order $\\de$ at infinity. The proof is based on the solution of a nonlinear elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients, which are, moreover, singular at the symmetry axis. Its combination with fixed boundary conditions was the basis of a recent treatment of the ``geomagnetic direction problem'' \\cite{KR22}. Here we have instead natural boundary conditions, which provide less information, and which require, therefore, in part new solution techniques and sharper estimates."

Conventional depth sensors have difficulty in sensing the depth of transparent objects due to refraction and reflection of light. Previous research has typically train a neural network to complete the depth acquired by the sensor, and this method can quickly and accurately acquire accurate depth maps of transparent objects. However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks. Our method simulates the depth deficits of transparent objects within non-transparent regions and utilizes the original depth map as ground truth for supervision. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to supervised approach, and pre-training with our method can improve the model performance when the training samples are small."

In this work, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be extended to complex and challenging problems in computational physics: the simulation of granular flows and fluid-particle interactions. LEDDS, our open-source framework, performs fully coupled Lattice Boltzmann -- Discrete Element Method (LBM-DEM) simulations using only algorithmic primitives, and runs efficiently on single-GPU platforms. The entire workflow, including neighbor search, collision detection, and fluid-particle coupling, is expressed as a sequence of portable primitives. While the current implementation illustrates these principles primarily through algorithms from the C++ Standard Library, with selective use of Thrust primitives for performance, the underlying concept is compatible with any HPC environment offering a rich set of parallel algorithms and is therefore applicable across a wide range of modern GPU systems and future accelerators. LEDDS is validated through benchmarks spanning both DEM and LBM-DEM configurations, including sphere and ellipsoid collisions, wall friction tests, single-particle settling, Jeffery's orbits, and particle-laden shear flows. Despite its high level of abstraction, LEDDS achieves performances comparable to those of hand-tuned CUDA solvers, while maintaining portability and code clarity. These results show that high-performance LBM-DEM coupling can be achieved without sacrificing generality or readability, establishing LEDDS as a blueprint for portable multiphysics frameworks based on algorithmic primitives."

To achieve this we need effective search algorithms that can identify powerful components and reuse them in new candidate architectures. In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS."

However, this transition is significantly impeded by the lack of scalable infrastructure capable of constructing high-quality interaction signals for effective policy learning. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive method designed to systematically scale the diversity and complexity of interactive environments. Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis. We train Nex-N1 upon the diverse and complex interactive environments established by our infrastructure. Empirical results on benchmarks such as SWE-bench and tau2 demonstrate that Nex-N1 consistently outperforms SOTA open-source models and achieves competitive performance against frontier proprietary models on complex agentic tasks. We open-source the Nex ecosystem and model weights to facilitate further research."

The first contribution introduces the Causal Dynamic Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), a model for estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs) by capturing unobserved heterogeneity in treatment response driven by latent risk factors that affect only outcomes. CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables. The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference. The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions. Scalable Jacobian-based regularization techniques are also developed."

At the center-stage, while waveguide based pinching antennas have been shown to beneficially ameliorate wireless propagation environments, their applications have remained confined to high-frequency scenarios. As a remedy, we propose a downlink generalized pinching-antenna system that adapts this compelling concept to low-frequency operation through a leaky-coaxial-cable (LCX) implementation. By endowing LCX structures with controllable radiation slots, the system inherits the key capabilities of waveguide based pinching antennas. Explicitly, these include reconfigurable line-of-sight (LoS) links, reduced path loss, and flexible deployment, while supporting a practical implementation of the pinching-antenna concept at low frequencies. A twin-stage propagation model is developed for characterizing both the guided transmission and wireless radiation encountered over LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths. Analytical results reveal strong local gain, complemented by rapid distance-dependent decay. Hence, we conceive a matching joint optimization framework, which maximizes throughput by harnessing game-theoretic association and convex power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna benchmarks."

We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainties and parameter correlations. The model reproduces the observed timing data and yields physically consistent values for moment of inertia fractions and creep timescales. Our results indicate that inward creep and a long-term change in external torque dominate the observed increase in spin-down rate, pointing to structural changes within the star-likely triggered by a crustquake that initiated both vortex motion and a change in the moment of inertia. We estimate that the glitch involved approximately $2.4 \\times 10^{12}$ inward-moving vortices and $\\sim 142$ crustal plates with a typical size of $\\sim 0.03$ km.

To address this challenge, we extend LGTSE with a Cross-Condition Consistency learning strategy, termed TripleC Learning. This strategy is first validated under multi-speaker-plus-noise condition and then evaluated for its generalization across diverse scenarios. Moreover, building upon the lightweight front-end denoiser in LGTSE, which can flexibly process both noisy and clean mixtures and shows strong generalization to unseen conditions, we integrate TripleC learning with a proposed parallel universal training scheme that organizes batches containing multiple scenarios for the same target speaker. By enforcing consistent extraction across different conditions, easier cases can assist harder ones, thereby fully exploiting diverse training data and fostering a robust universal model. Experimental results on the Libri2Mix three-condition tasks demonstrate that the proposed LGTSE with TripleC learning achieves superior performance over condition-specific models, highlighting its strong potential for universal deployment in real-world speech applications."

Here we use the oxygen isotopic compositions of Solar System solids, which has been attributed to photochemistry in the solar nebula, to quantitatively evaluate whether this processing could have produced the conditions needed to provide the diversity of compositions seen in the Solar System. We do this by modeling the chemical evolution while fine dust grows into the building blocks of the planets. We find that the oxygen isotopic evolution cannot be attributed to processing in the solar nebula and must instead be inherited from the parent molecular cloud. Further, our results indicate that the observed photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks does not significantly impact the compositions of planets that form within."

    "abstract": "Suppose that $f:X\\to C$ is a general Jacobian elliptic surface over the complex numbers. Then the primitive cohomology $H^{1,1}_{prim}(X)$ has, up to a sign, a natural orthonormal basis $(η_i)_{i\\in [1, N]}$ given by certain meromorphic $2$-forms $η_i$ of the second kind, one for each ramification point of the classifying morphism $φ$ from $C$ to the stack of generalized elliptic curves. (Here $N$ is any one of $h^{1,1}_{prim}(X)$, the number of moduli of $X$ and the degree of the ramification of $φ$; these numbers are equal.) A choice of local co-ordinate on the stack of elliptic curves provides, via the branch locus of $φ$, an {é}tale local co-ordinate system $(t_i)_{i\\in [1, N]}$ on the stack of Jacobian elliptic surfaces. The main result here is that truncation of the Gauss--Manin connexion yields the system $$\\{\\partial_i H=(\\partial_i η_i\\wedgeη_i)H\\}_{i\\in [1, N]}$$ of non-linear pde satisfied by $H=[η_1,\\ldots, η_N]$, where $\\partial_i =\\partial/\\partial t_i$ and the skew tensor $\\partial_i η_i\\wedgeη_i$ of rank $2$ is the ecliptic of $η_i$ (the plane in which the particle $η_i$ is instantaneously moving with respect to $t_i$). Moreover, after rigidification of the integral cohomology, $H$ can be interpreted as providing a period map for these surfaces with values in the complex orthogonal group $O_N$, and we prove a generic infinitesimal Torelli theorem for this map. For rational elliptic surfaces this can be calculated explicitly."

    "abstract": "Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) inherently follow a coarse-to-fine generation process, where high-level semantic structure is generated slightly earlier than fine-grained texture. This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling. Project page and code: https://yuemingpan.github.io/SFD.github.io/."

    "abstract": "An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport."

For the ACE leaderboard we evaluated 10 frontier models (with websearch turned on) using a novel grading methodology that dynamically checks whether relevant parts of the response are grounded in the retrieved web sources. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) is the top-performing model, scoring 56.1%, followed by o3 Pro (Thinking = On) (55.2%) and GPT 5.1 (Thinking = High) (55.1%).

    "abstract": "This work investigates how disturbance-aware, robustness-embedded reference trajectories translate into driving performance when executed by professional drivers in a dynamic simulator. Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories."

Virtually all analytical treatments, however, fall into one of two superficially unrelated conceptual frameworks: the resonant-state approach and the instanton method. Whereas the concept of resonant states and their associated decay widths is grounded in physical reasoning by capturing the regime of uniform probability decay, the instanton method lacks a comparably clear physical interpretation. We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states."

    "abstract": "Data-driven methodologies are nowadays ubiquitous. Their rapid development and spread have led to applications even beyond the traditional fields of science. As far as dynamical systems and differential equations are concerned, neural networks and sparse identification tools have emerged as powerful approaches to recover the governing equations from available temporal data series. In this chapter we first illustrate possible extensions of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, originally developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to delay differential equations (DDEs) with discrete, possibly multiple and unknown delays. Two methods are presented for SINDy, one directly tackles the underlying DDE and the other acts on the system of ODEs approximating the DDE through pseudospectral collocation. We also introduce another way of capturing the dynamics of DDEs using neural networks and trainable delays in continuous time, and present the training algorithms developed for these neural delay differential equations (NDDEs). The relevant MATLAB implementations for both the SINDy approach and for the NDDE approach are provided. These approaches are tested on several examples, including classical systems such as the delay logistic and the Mackey-Glass equation, and directly compared to each other on the delayed Rössler system. We provide insights on the connection between the approaches and future directions on developing data-driven methods for time delay systems."

To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost fabrication method for 3D waveguide crossings by exploiting the edge rounding effect inherent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Using this method, we demonstrate waveguide crossings with average loss below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB on Ta2O5-on-LNOI integrated photonic platform. Our method maintains full compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing technology and paves the way for realizing VLSPI on the thin-film lithium niobate platform."

Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision. The system successfully tracks agile FPV drones under real-world operational conditions on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Our paper code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffry-wen/SDG-Track"

    "abstract": "We introduce novel approximate systems for dispersive and diffusive-dispersive equations with nonlinear fluxes. For purely dispersive equations, we construct a first-order, strictly hyperbolic approximation. Local well-posedness of smooth solutions is achieved by constructing a unique symmetrizer that applies to arbitrary smooth fluxes. Under stronger conditions on the fluxes, we provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system that corresponds to the energy of the underlying dispersive equation. To approximate diffusive-dispersive equations, we rely on a viscoelastic damped system that is compatible with the found entropy for the hyperbolic approximation of the dispersive evolution. For the resulting hyperbolic-parabolic approximation, we provide a global well-posedness result. Using the relative entropy framework \\cite{dafermos2005hyperbolic}, we prove that the solutions of the approximate systems converge to solutions of the original equations. The structure of the new approximate systems allows to apply standard numerical simulation methods from the field of hyperbolic balance laws. We confirm the convergence of our approximations even beyond the validity range of our theoretical findings on set of test cases covering different target equations. We show the applicability of the approach for strong nonlinear effects leading to oscillating or shock-layer-forming behavior."

An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms into cationic sites. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression.

When applied to the actor model, join patterns offer the novel capability of matching combinations of messages in the mailbox of an actor. Previous work by Philipp Haller et al. in the paper \"Fair Join Pattern Matching for Actors\" (ECOOP 2024) explored join patterns with conditional guards in an actor-based setting with a specification of fair and deterministic matching semantics. Nevertheless, the question of time efficiency in fair join pattern matching has remained underexplored. The stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. performs worse than an implementation that adapts the Rete algorithm to the regular version of a join pattern matching benchmark, while outperforming on a variant with heavy conditional guards, which take longer to evaluate. Nevertheless, conforming Rete to the problem of join pattern matching requires heavy manual adaptation. In this thesis, we enhance and optimize the stateful tree-based matching algorithm of Haller et al. to achieve up to tenfold performance improvements on certain benchmarks, approaching the performance of Rete on regular benchmarks while maintaining the advantages of versatility and performance with heavy guards. We also enhance the benchmark suite, adding new features and enhancing its extensibility and user-friendliness. We extend the join pattern implementation with a less ambiguous syntax as well as dynamic pattern switching. Finally, we present a new complex model use case for join patterns, showing their applicability in a microservice web architecture."

In the finite-sample setting, the associated Gram operators inherit a structured residual decomposition that leads to a canonical form of kernel ridge regression and a principled way to enforce nuisance invariance.

Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors."

While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to query knowledge graphs (KGs) due to their strong semantic understanding and extrapolation capabilities compared to traditional approaches. However, these methods cannot be applied when the KG contains sensitive data and the user lacks the resources to deploy a local generative LLM. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-aware query generation approach for KGs. Our method identifies sensitive information in the graph based on its structure and omits such values before requesting the LLM to translate natural language questions into Cypher queries. Experimental results show that our approach preserves the quality of the generated queries while preventing sensitive data from being transmitted to third-party services."

They could provide the ideal condition for searching for possible new physics beyond general relativity. However, such events are presumably rare and difficult to occur under normal conditions. Black holes in a triple system can be accelerated to the relativistic limit and may harbor the chance for a relativistic collision. In this paper, we study the relativistic black hole collisions in a massive black hole background and the capabilities of several current and future gravitational wave detectors in detecting such signals."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations."

    "abstract": "Mortality data are relevant to demography, public health, and actuarial science. Whilst clustering is increasingly used to explore patterns in such data, no study has reviewed its application to country-level all-cause mortality. This review therefore summarises recent work and addresses key questions: why clustering is used, which mortality data are analysed, which methods are most common, and what main findings emerge. To address these questions, we examine studies applying clustering to country-level all-cause mortality, focusing on mortality indices, data sources, and methodological choices, and we replicate some approaches using Human Mortality Database (HMD) data. Our analysis reveals that clustering is mainly motivated by forecasting and by studying convergence and inequality. Most studies use HMD data from developed countries and rely on k-means, hierarchical, or functional clustering. Main findings include a persistent East-West European division across applications, with clustering generally improving forecast accuracy over single-country models. Overall, this review highlights the methodological range in the literature, summarises clustering results, and identifies gaps, such as the limited evaluation of clustering quality and the underuse of data from countries outside the high-income world."

    "abstract": "Sphere packing, Hilbert's eighteenth problem, asks for the densest arrangement of congruent spheres in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration."

    "abstract": "Subjective mean opinion scores (MOS) remain the de-facto target for non-intrusive speech and singing quality assessment. However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified \"simple\" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets."

    "abstract": "Several researchers have developed a rich toolbox of matrix compression techniques that exploit structure and redundancy in large matrices. Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail. Initial work by Le Borne addressed this by modifying the admissibility criterion for structured grids with constant convection, but challenges remain for more general grids and advection fields. In this work, we propose a novel partitioning strategy based on \"convection tubes\", clusters aligned with the convection vector field. This method does not require a structured grid or constant convection, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. We present both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for convection-dominated PDEs on unstructured grids. The approach builds on a Péclet-robust Caccioppoli inequality, crucial for handling convection-dominated problems."

    "abstract": "We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties in hot nuclear matter accounting for the medium modifications of the nucleons within a chiral SU(3) model including effects from isospin asymmetry. Using the relaxation time approximation, the transport coefficients of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity are studied. The shear viscosity, $η$, calculated within the chiral SU(3) model is observed to be smaller than the values calculated for free nucleon gas, whereas the thermal conductivity $κ$ is appreciably larger as compared to the free nucleon gas. The shear viscosity coefficient to entropy density ratio, $η/s$, drops with increasing baryon density which becomes more pronounced at higher temperatures in the chiral SU(3) model as compared to the case of a free nucleon gas. The effect due to isospin asymmetry on the coefficient of shear viscosity turns out to be marginal. However, in the chiral SU(3) model, in presence of isospin asymmetry, the coefficient of thermal conductivity has an appreciably higher value as compared to the one for symmetric nuclear matter. The present study of the thermodynamic as well as transport properties in hot nuclear matter is of relevance for relativistic heavy-ion collisions with different initial isospin asymmetry, in particular for the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the FAIR facility at GSI."

In this work, we take a step toward filling this gap, by using the well-known Steady-State ab Initio Laser Theory (SALT) equations [L. Ge et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 063824 (2010)] to carry out an extensive set of statistical analyses and establish connections between the random network geometry and their ultimate emission spectrum. Our results show that edge crowding is key to tune the uniformity of the modal intensity distribution of the emission spectrum. A statistical framework for the comprehensive understanding of the network statistical properties is highly significant to establish precise design rules for network-based photonic devices and intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "Discovering the neural mechanisms underpinning cognition is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience. However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions."

By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and quantify the magnetic field imprints using matched filtering techniques. Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations."

We propose two algorithms: a preprocessing-schur complement-projected gradient ascent algorithm for scenarios without sensing quality of service (QoS) constraints, which explores the potential range of sensing performance to provide reference and warm-starting for subsequent constrained optimization; and a heuristic reflective projected dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm for sensing QoS-constrained scenarios, which achieves substantial performance gains under non-convex constraints with a small number of iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that these approaches enhance both the communication sum-rate and the lower of the Cramér-Rao lower bound of motion parameter estimation, validating the effectiveness of MA-assisted beamforming in dynamic V2I ISAC networks."

This model integrates both monaural and binaural auditory features and has been validated across six audio datasets encompassing quality ratings for music and speech, processed via algorithms commonly employed in modern hearing devices (e.g., acoustic transparency, feedback cancellation, and binaural beamforming) or presented via loudspeakers. In the current study, we expand eMoBi-Q to account for perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss (HL) on audio quality. For this, the model was extended by a nonlinear auditory filterbank. Given that altered loudness perception is a prevalent issue among listeners with hearing impairment, our goal is to incorporate loudness as a sub-dimension for predicting audio quality in both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired populations. While predicting loudness itself is important in the context of loudness-based hearing aid fitting, loudness as audio quality sub-measure may be helpful for the selection of reliable auditory features in hearing impaired listeners. The parameters of the filterbank and subsequent processing stages were informed by the physiologically-based (binaural) loudness model proposed by Pieper et al. (2018). This study presents and discusses the initial implementation of the extended binaural quality model."

In safety-critical environments, deploying these methods requires rigorous guarantees, a need that has motivated much recent work at the interface of statistical learning and control. However, many existing approaches achieve this goal at the cost of sacrificing valuable data for testing and calibration, or by constraining the choice of learning algorithm, thus leading to suboptimal performances. In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control. In many of these applications, P2L delivers designs and certificates that outperform commonly employed methods, and shows strong potential for broad applicability in diverse practical settings."

Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations."

Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields.

    "abstract": "This paper develops semantic typing in a smart-contract setting to ensure type safety of code that uses statically untypable language constructs, such as the fallback function. The idea is that the creator of a contract on the blockchain equips code containing such constructs with a formal proof of its type safety, given in terms of the semantics of types. Then, a user of the contract only needs to check the validity of the provided `proof certificate' of type safety. This is a form of proof-carrying code, which naturally fits with the immutable nature of the blockchain environment. As a concrete application of our approach, we focus on ensuring information flow control and non-interference for the language TINYSOL, a distilled version of the Solidity language, through security types. We provide the semantics of types in terms of a typed operational semantics of TINYSOL, and a way for expressing the proofs of safety as coinductively-defined typing interpretations and for representing them compactly via up-to techniques, similar to those used for bisimilarity. We also show how our machinery can be used to type the typical pointer-to-implementation pattern based on the fallback function. However, our main contribution is not the safety theorem per se (and so security properties different from non-interference can be considered as well), but rather the presentation of the theoretical developments necessary to make this approach work in a blockchain/smart-contract setting."

Its reliability is limited by noise and decorrelation in radar acquisitions, which makes accurate reconstruction of the deformation signal challenging. We propose a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based framework for InSAR phase unwrapping, UnwrapDiff, in which the output of the traditional minimum cost flow algorithm (SNAPHU) is incorporated as conditional guidance. To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions."

We present ALMA QUARKS/ATOMS 1.3 mm/3 mm observations (the highest resolution $\\sim0.01$ pc) of a deeply embedded HC H II region (diameter $\\sim0.015$ pc, electron density $\\sim2\\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) exhibiting a striking $\\gtrsim20$ km s$^{-1}$ global redshift seen in optically thin H30$α$/H40$α$ recombination lines relative to its parental hot molecular core within a hub-filament system. The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of \"hatching out of the egg\": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution."

Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the AP-user associations and the RA boresight directions.

As a result, such new configurations as M48 and M60 are found to show substantially higher illumination uniformity than any other existing direct drive systems.

    "abstract": "Pinching antennas, realized through position-adjustable radiating elements along dielectric waveguides, have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna technology thanks to their ability to dynamically reshape large-scale channel conditions. However, most existing studies focus on idealized LoS-dominated environments, overlooking the stochastic nature of realistic wireless propagation. This paper investigates a more practical multiuser pinching-antenna system under a composite probabilistic channel model that captures distance-dependent LoS blockage and NLoS scattering. To account for both efficiency and reliability aspects of communication, two complementary design metrics are considered: an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric characterizing long-term throughput and fairness, and an outage-constrained metric ensuring a prescribed reliability level. Based on these metrics, we formulate two optimization problems: the first maximizes the max-min average SNR across users, while the second maximizes a guaranteed SNR threshold under per-user outage constraints. Although both problems are inherently nonconvex, we exploit their underlying monotonic structures and develop low-complexity, bisection-based algorithms that achieve globally optimal solutions using only simple scalar evaluations. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems significantly outperform conventional fixed-antenna designs even under random LoS and NLoS channels."

Here, we employ a high-throughput screening strategy, applying a multi-step filter to the Materials Project database (>154,000 materials), which yielded 2,519 candidate materials for detailed first-principle evaluation. From these calculations, we identify 32 NLO materials with strong shift current response ($σ$ > 100 $μA/V^2$). Our work reveals that layered structures with $C_{3v}$ symmetry and heavy $p$-block elements (e.g. Te, Sb) exhibit apparent superiority in enhancing shift current. More importantly, 9 of these compounds show shift current response peaks in the IR region, with the strongest reaching 616 $μA/V^2$, holding significant application potential in fields such as IR photodetection, sensing, and energy harvesting. Beyond identifying promising candidates, this work establishes a comprehensive and high-quality first-principles dataset for NLO response, providing a solid foundation for future AI-driven screening and accelerated discovery of high-performance NLO materials, as demonstrated by a prototype machine-learning application."

Our work has four key contributions: (1) A computer-controlled circulating water tunnel (CWT) with programmatic control of flow velocity, cylinder position, and forcing parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) with data acquisition (displacement, force, and torque). (2) Automated experiments reproduce literature benchmarks (Khalak and Williamson [1999] and Assi et al. [2013, 2010]) with frequency lock-in within 4% and matching critical spacing trends. (3) The framework with Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) discovers more WIV amplitude response phenomena, and uses a neural network to fit physical laws from data, which is 31% higher than that of polynomial fitting. (4) The framework with multi-agent with virtual-real interaction system executes hundreds of experiments end-to-end, which automatically completes the entire process of scientific research from hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.

    "abstract": "Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures."

This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d."

One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window."

We establish viscosity solutions for the associated HJB--Isaacs equation, prove uniqueness via comparison principles, and provide verification theorems. The linear-quadratic structure yields explicit feedback controls derived from a coupled Riccati system, preserving analytical tractability despite adversarial uncertainty. Simulations reveal distinct loss-of-control regimes driven by robustness-breakdown and control saturation, alongside a pronounced asymmetry in sensitivity between the mean and variance channels.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in velocity and temperature transformations have enabled recovery of the law of the wall in compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. Building on this foundation, a flux-controlled wall model (FCWM) for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is proposed. Unlike conventional wall-stress models that solve the turbulent boundary layer equations, FCWM formulates the near-wall modeling as a control problem applied directly to the outer LES solution. It consists of three components: (1) the compressible law of the wall, (2) a feedback flux-control strategy, and (3) a shifted boundary condition. The model adjusts the wall shear stress and heat flux based on discrepancies between the computed and target transformed velocity and temperature, respectively, at the matching location. The proposed wall model is evaluated using LES of turbulent channel flows across a broad range of conditions, including quasi-incompressible cases with bulk Mach number \\(M_b = 0.1\\) and friction Reynolds number \\(Re_τ= 180 \\sim 10{,}000\\), and compressible cases with \\(M_b = 0.74 \\sim 4.0\\) and bulk Reynolds number \\(Re_b = 7667 \\sim 34{,}000\\).

Both Gleeok-128 and Gleeok-256 use a 256 bit key, with block sizes of 128 and 256 bits, respectively. Owing to its multi branch structure, evaluating security margins and mounting effective key recovery attacks present nontrivial challenges. This paper provides the first comprehensive third party cryptanalysis of Gleeok-128. We introduce a two stage MILP based framework for constructing branch wise and full cipher differential linear (DL) distinguishers, together with an integral based key recovery framework tailored to multi branch designs. Our DL analysis yields 7, 7, 8, and 4 round distinguishers for Branch 1, Branch 2, Branch 3, and Gleeok-128, respectively, with squared correlations approximately 2 to the power minus 88.12, 2 to the power minus 88.12, 2 to the power minus 38.73, and 2 to the power minus 49.04, outperforming those in the design document except for the full PRF case. By tightening algebraic degree bounds, we further derive 9, 9, and 7 round integral distinguishers for the three branches and a 7 round distinguisher for the full PRF, extending the designers results by 3, 3, and 2 rounds and by 2 rounds, respectively. These integral properties enable 7 round and 8 round key recovery attacks in the non full codebook and full codebook settings. In addition, we identify a flaw in the original linear security evaluation of Branch 3, showing that it can be distinguished over all 12 rounds with data complexity about 2 to the power 48. We also propose optimized linear layer parameters that significantly improve linear resistance without sacrificing diffusion. Our results advance the understanding of Gleeok-128 and provide general methods for analyzing multi branch symmetric designs."

The development of advanced MCP detectors is ongoing and pursues the major goals of maximizing sensitivity, resolution, and lifetime, while at the same time decreasing weight, volume, and power consumption. Development efforts for an MCP-based detector system for the UV are running at IAAT at the University of Tübingen. In this publication, we present our latest results towards coating aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) photocathodes directly on MCPs, to improve quantum detection efficiency in the far- and extreme-UV. Furthermore, we report on the implementation of a non-iterative centroiding algorithm for our coplanar cross-strip anode directly in an FPGA."

This class of spaces, which includes the complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the Cayley hyperbolic plane, generalizes the real hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Our approach introduces a unified algebraic framework that generalizes the Möbius addition, previously used for the constant curvature case, to define the random walk via a non-Euclidean summation of variables. We demonstrate that the renormalized walk converges to the heat kernel associated with the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$, which plays the role of the limiting normal law. The proofs leverage the harmonic analysis of spherical functions on symmetric spaces. To the best of our knowledge, these results are new in the context of rank one symmetric spaces."

    "abstract": "This work introduces a quantitative method for assessing calcification in fibrocartilage using spectral micro-computed tomography ($μ$CT). Tissue samples of hip acetabular labrum from patients with osteoarthritis and femoroacetabular impingement were imaged with a laboratory-based spectral $μ$CT system equipped with a small-pixel photon-counting detector. The detector operated with two energy thresholds, allowing the simultaneous acquisition of two CT datasets at different X-ray energies. A material decomposition algorithm accounting for the system's spectral response was applied to separate calcium- and water-like components, yielding three-dimensional visualization and quantification of calcified regions within intact paraffin-embedded samples. Unlike the conventional method for calcification assessment based on histology, this spectral μCT approach offers volumetric quantification of calcium structures without physical sectioning or staining. The method achieved a voxel size of 20 $μ$m for samples up to ~3 cm, with a calcium detection threshold of ~0.3 g/cm$^3$ for structures down to 50 $μ$m. Quantification accuracy was estimated to be 5% by using a calibration phantom. Further comparison with histology demonstrated the correct localization of calcium spatial distributions and a match in the calcium crystal deposition score by providing non-destructive, quantitative 3D calcium maps of preserved tissue samples. This technique complements histology and could enhance the characterization of pathological fibrocartilage calcification in hip joint disorders."

Using I2I-Bench, we benchmark numerous mainstream image editing models, investigating the gaps and trade-offs between editing models across various dimensions.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) of multiple intersections. Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions."

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."

Three classes of machine learning approaches - unsupervised, supervised, and explainable - were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the first two principal components, which together explained more than 50 percent of the variance. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and compared, alongside unsupervised and explainable methods. Model development and evaluation used a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). The PCA factor map showed substantial overlap between listeners, indicating that cleanly separating participants into six Bisgaard classes based solely on their loudness patterns is challenging. Nevertheless, the models demonstrated reasonable classification performance, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy among supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, within certain limits, from calibration-independent loudness perception data, supporting potential applications in remote or resource-limited settings without requiring a traditional audiogram."

In the first strategy, a pump with variable speed drive (VSD) and split-range control for the flow rate achieves losses from 0 wt% to 0.24 wt% in an uncertainty analysis. A pump efficiency approaching 70% is the most important factor to minimize losses. In contrast, a fixed-speed pump has unacceptably high losses ranging from 0.76 wt% to 1.06 wt% (119 tons per ship). The second strategy is to increase the maximum pressure in the seaborne tank (base case is 1.15 bara). Zero loss is achieved for the fixed speed pump if the maximum pressure is increased to 1.35 bara, while 1.22 bara is required for the pump with VSD assuming an efficiency of 60%."

Propagation losses and perturbations in the encoded photons' degrees of freedom, such as polarisation or phase, limit both the QKD range and key rate. The maintenance of phase coherence over optical fibres has lately received considerable attention as it enables QKD over long distances, e.g., through phase-based protocols like Twin-Field (TF) QKD. While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future. Whereas the co-existence of quantum and classical signals in HCF has already been demonstrated, the phase noise resilience required for phase-based QKD protocols is yet to be established. This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration. The second, uses a TF-QKD interferometer consisting of HCF and SMF channels. These initial results indicate that HCF is suitable for use in TF-QKD and other phase-based QKD protocols."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents -- LLMs that dynamically interact with an environment over long horizons -- have become an increasingly important area of research, enabling automation in complex tasks involving tool-use, web browsing, and dialogue with people. In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents."

The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\\log_{10}B\\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\\% interval for the $(2,\\pm2)$ peak amplitude.

MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method.

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the \"missing modality\" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision."

On modern GPUs, high-order polynomial evaluations cost roughly the same as low-order ones, provided the DG degrees of freedom fit within device memory. However, even with high-order discretizations, simulations at high Reynolds numbers still require some level of under-resolution, leaving them sensitive to numerical dissipation and aliasing effects. Here, we investigate the interplay between intrinsic DG dissipation mechanisms (implicit dissipation) -- in particular split forms and Riemann solvers -- and explicit subgrid-scale models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Using the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex at $Re = 1600$ and an inviscid case ($Re \\to \\infty$), we evaluate kinetic energy dissipation, spectral accuracy, and numerical stability. Our results show that when stability for under-resolved turbulence is ensured through split-forms (energy- or entropy-stable) schemes, subgrid-scale (SGS) LES models are not strictly necessary. At moderate Reynolds numbers, when the spatial resolution is sufficient to capture the relevant turbulence scales (i.e., in well-resolved LES), adding SGS models does not improve accuracy because the wavenumber range where they act overlaps with the inherent numerical dissipation of the DG scheme. In contrast, when the resolution is insufficient, as is typical at high Reynolds numbers, explicit subgrid-scale models complement the numerical dissipation and enhance accuracy by removing the excess energy that numerical fluxes alone cannot dissipate. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing numerical strategies in high-order turbulence simulations."

    "abstract": "In modern artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a cornerstone for visual and perceptual tasks. However, their implementation on conventional electronic hardware faces fundamental bottlenecks in speed and energy efficiency due to resistive and capacitive losses. Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360°, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultralow-latency, ultralow-energy vision processing for real-time intelligent systems."

Despite the empirical success of methods such as best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling and sequential revision, their fundamental limits remain unclear. We address this gap by analyzing a mixture-of-reference policy model and proving that standard BoN is inherently suboptimal. To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones. On the theoretical side, we show that reward-filtered sequential inference yields strictly stronger guarantees than standard TTC paradigms. On the empirical side, we evaluate such an inference strategy across diverse benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over widely used approaches, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our framework."

We propose AdmTree, a novel framework for adaptive, hierarchical context compression with a central focus on preserving high semantic fidelity while maintaining efficiency. AdmTree dynamically segments input based on information density, utilizing gist tokens to summarize variable-length segments as the leaves of a semantic binary tree. This structure, together with a lightweight aggregation mechanism and a frozen backbone LLM (thereby minimizing new trainable parameters), enables efficient hierarchical abstraction of the context. By preserving fine-grained details alongside global semantic coherence, mitigating positional bias, and dynamically adapting to content, AdmTree robustly retains the semantic information of long contexts."

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis. Additionally, we compare our method against multiple baselines in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness."

By extending classical Hamilton-Jacobi theory to dissipative systems through contact geometry, we derive a dissipative contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation that governs the evolution of spatiotemporal structures. This approach naturally incorporates energy dissipation while preserving geometric structure, enabling systematic analysis of pattern formation across parameter regimes. We establish the contact dynamical formulation of the CGLE, identify conserved quantities within this geometric framework, and develop canonical transformations that reduce the complex 2D field dynamics to analytically tractable 1D real field problems. The resulting elliptic function solutions explicitly demonstrate the continuous transition between periodic and localised structures as the elliptic modulus approaches unity. Our framework reveals how conserved contact potential, rather than energy, governs the emergence of ordered patterns in dissipative media. This geometric perspective not only provides analytical tools for solving nonlinear wave equations but also establishes fundamental connections between contact geometry, dissipative structure theory, and nonlinear pattern formation across physical and biological systems."

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked.

To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection.

Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration.

We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions.

It extracts templates directly from source code prior to deployment and supplements them with data-driven parsing for logs without available code. LLM-SrcLog integrates a cross-function static code analyzer to reconstruct meaningful logging contexts, an LLM-based white-box template extractor with post-processing to distinguish constants from variables, and a black-box template extractor that incorporates data-driven clustering for remaining unmatched logs. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Hadoop and Zookeeper) and a large-scale industrial system (Sunfire-Compute) show that, compared to two LLM-based baselines, LLM-SrcLog improves average F1-score by 2-17% and 8-35%. Meanwhile, its online parsing latency is comparable to data-driven methods and about 1,000 times faster than per-log LLM parsing. LLM-SrcLog achieves a near-ideal balance between speed and accuracy. Finally, we further validate the effectiveness of LLM-SrcLog through practical case studies in a real-world production environment."

    "abstract": "The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology."

    "abstract": "We investigate the convergence dynamics of this system near period-doubling bifurcations by combining analytical derivations and large-scale numerical simulations. At the bifurcation threshold ($K = K_c$), the dynamics reduce to a normal form that produces a power-law decay $d(n) \\propto n^{-1/2}$, from which the critical exponents $α= 1$, $β= -1/2$, and $z = -2$ are derived. These analytical predictions are confirmed numerically and shown to satisfy the homogeneous scaling relation $z = α/ β$. Linearization of the map near the fixed point yields an exponential relaxation law $d_n = d_0 e^{-n/τ}$ for $K < K_c$, with $τ\\propto (K_c - K)^{-1}$, leading to the relaxation exponent $δ= -1$. The remarkable agreement between theory and simulation demonstrates that the dissipative relativistic kicked rotator shares the same universality class as one-dimensional unimodal maps, despite its higher dimensionality and relativistic corrections."

    "abstract": "We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians from the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) combined with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\\rm Fe}_{x}{\\rm Ge}$ and ${\\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\\rm Co}_{y}{\\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \\textit{Magesty.jl}."

    "abstract": "Recent image denoising methods have leveraged generative modeling for real noise synthesis to address the costly acquisition of real-world noisy data. However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data. The code is available at https://github.com/chjinny/GuidNoise."

We present BALI (Bidirectional Action-Language Inference) for goal prediction, a method that integrates natural language preferences with observed human actions in a receding-horizon planning tree. BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals. We evaluate the approach in collaborative cooking tasks, where goals may be novel to the robot and unbounded. Compared to baselines, BALI yields more stable goal predictions and significantly fewer mistakes."

    "abstract": "Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly."

Building on a latent time series framework called Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time-series (OUT), we propose a shared-parameter framework-the spOUT autoregressive model (spOUTAR)-that jointly models two related multivariate time series and enables coherent Bayesian estimation of their corresponding stationary precision matrices. This framework provides a principled mechanism to detect and quantify which conditional relationships among the variables changed, or formed following the crisis. Specifically, we study the impact of the Great Recession (December 2007-June 2009) that substantially disrupted global and national economies, prompting long-lasting shifts in macroeconomic indicators and their interrelationships. While many studies document its economic consequences, far less is known about how the underlying conditional dependency structure among economic variables changed as economies moved from pre-crisis stability through the shock and back to normalcy. Using the proposed approach to analyze U.S. and OECD macroeconomic data, we demonstrate that spOUTAR effectively captures recession-induced changes in stationary graphical structure, offering a flexible and interpretable tool for studying structural shifts in economic systems."

The proposed method enables accurate direction finding of acoustic sources over both 180 and 360 degrees angular ranges. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the metagrating-based compressive sensing approach against noise and limited sampling. Experimental validation is conducted to verify its feasibility with practical metagrating prototyes. Compared wiith tranditional array-based localisation techniques, the single-pixel metagrating system significantly reduces hardward complexity while maintaining high localisation accuracy.

Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $α$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems."

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

Due to the inherent nonlinearity of contact problems, conventional methods that treat the entire domain as a monolithic system often lead to high global complexity. To address this, we develop an iterative contact-resolving hybrid method by localizing nonlinear contact constraints within a smaller subdomain, while the larger subdomain is governed by a linear system. Our system employs variational inequality theory, minimization principles, and penalty methods. More importantly, we propose four discretization types within the two-subdomain framework, ranging from applying standard/mixed FEM across the entire domain to combining standard/mixed multiscale methods in the larger subdomain with standard/mixed FEM in the smaller one. % The standard finite element method and standard constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method are simple and easy to demonstrate. By employing a multiscale reduction technique, the method avoids excessive degrees of freedom inherent in conventional methods in the larger domain, while the mixed formulation enables direct stress computation, ensures local momentum conservation, and resists locking in nearly incompressible materials. Convergence analysis and the corresponding algorithms are provided for all cases. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the approaches."

Unlike static methods that require global re-initialization which incurs high communication overhead, our algorithm propagates information from the site of the change, updating only the affected nodes' state values. This approach, which builds upon a maximum consensus protocol, not only ensures convergence to the correct AP set following topological changes but also preserves network privacy by preventing nodes from reconstructing the global topology. We provide rigorous proofs of correctness for this eventual convergence and demonstrate its applicability and efficiency through experiments."

Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles. SemCom departs from bit-level fidelity and instead emphasizes task-oriented meaning exchange, enabling compact SC and introducing new performance measures such as semantic fidelity and task success rate. Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice.

    "abstract": "Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements."

Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interpretability remains elusive, particularly when evaluating their intricate decision-making processes. Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP."

    "abstract": "Modern GPU software stacks demand developers who can anticipate performance bottlenecks before ever launching a kernel; misjudging floating-point workloads upstream can derail tuning, scheduling, and even hardware procurement. Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena."

Our concept of island-ready, resilient-by-design 6G communication networks envisions local cellular connectivity allowing users to connect to regional application servers, which is currently impossible. In our conceptualization, we follow an all-society approach, as realizing island connectivity requires the cooperation of multiple actors, including users, operators, developers, providers, and authorities. We evaluate how island-ready 5G and 5G-Advanced systems are and outline the open challenges stakeholders must address for full island readiness, such as decentralizing the 6G core network and designing local-first application architectures."

    "abstract": "Popular offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods rely on conservatism, either by penalizing out-of-dataset actions or by restricting planning horizons. In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL."

Miniature beam clocks are expected to suppress many of the shifts that commonly limit existing chip-scale atomic clocks based on coherent population trapping, including collisional shifts and some light shifts. However, the beam geometry can amplify some challenges such as Doppler shifts, which generate a strong sensitivity to laser frequency variation. Using a cm-scale 87Rb atom beam clock, we identify a surprisingly strong competition between Doppler shifts and resonant light shifts arising from asymmetric decay in the clock spectroscopy Λ-system. Leveraging this competition between Doppler and resonant light shifts, we demonstrate clock operation at specific, convenient experimental parameters consistent with zero sensitivity to laser frequency variation and white-noise-limited clock frequency averaging for 1000 s of integration."

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models."

While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their per-iteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations. The proposed algorithm has a quantum complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} κ_A \\log(\\frac{1}ε))$ queries to QRAM and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log(\\frac{1}ε))$ classical arithmetic operations. Our method outperforms the worst-case complexity of prior classical and quantum IPMs, offering a significant improvement in scalability and computational efficiency."

To demonstrate when io_uring delivers the greatest benefits and how to use it effectively in modern database systems, we evaluate it in two use cases: Integrating io_uring into a storage-bound buffer manager and using it for high-throughput data shuffling in network-bound analytical workloads. We further analyze how advanced io_uring features, such as registered buffers and passthrough I/O, affect end-to-end performance. Our study shows when low-level optimizations translate into tangible system-wide gains and how architectural choices influence these benefits. Building on these insights, we derive practical guidelines for designing I/O-intensive systems using io_uring and validate their effectiveness in a case study of PostgreSQL's recent io_uring integration, where applying our guidelines yields a performance improvement of 14%."

The aim is the derivation of effective models for $\\varepsilon\\to 0 $, when the thickness of the layer tends to zero. For the flow problem we consider incompressible Stokes equations with a pressure boundary condition on the top/bottom of the layer, and the transport problem is given by reaction-diffusion-advection problem with advective flow governed from the fluid velocity from the Stokes model and different scalings for the diffusion coefficient modelling low and fast diffusion in the horizontal direction. In the limit, a Darcy-type law is obtained for the Stokes flow with Darcy-velocity depending only on the derivative of the Darcy-pressure in the vertical direction. The effective equation for the transport problem is again of diffusion-advection-type including homogenized coefficients, and with advective flow given by the Darcy-velocity and only taking place in the vertical direction. In the case of slow diffusion in the vertical direction, effective diffusion only takes place in the vertical direction, where in the case of high diffusion in horizontal direction, we obtain effective diffusion in all space directions. To pass to the limit we use the method of two-scale convergence adapted to our microscopic geometry, which is based on uniform a priori estimates. Critical parts in the derivation of the macro-models are the control of the fluid pressure, for which we construct a Bogovskii-operator for thin perforated domains, as well as the strong two-scale convergence for the microscopic solution of the transport equation, necessary to pass to the limit in the advective term."

We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls."

Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation. We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from ~ -12 mag along the polar direction to ~ -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using \"mini-supernovae\" to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers."

Modern representations transform molecular graphs into persistence image tensors that preserve multiscale geometric and topological structure, yet existing tensor classifiers and deep tensor neural networks provide no finite-sample guarantees on type I error and often exhibit severe error inflation in practice. We develop the first Tensor Neyman-Pearson (Tensor-NP) classification framework that achieves finite-sample control of type I error while exploiting the multi-mode structure of tensor data. Under a tensor-normal mixture model, we derive the oracle NP discriminant, characterize its Tucker low-rank manifold geometry, and establish tensor-specific margin and conditional detection conditions enabling high-probability bounds on excess type II error. We further propose a Discriminant Tensor Iterative Projection estimator and a Tensor-NP Neural Classifier combining deep learning with Tensor-NP umbrella calibration, yielding the first distribution-free NP-valid methods for multiway data. Across four biochemical datasets, Tensor-NP classifiers maintain type I errors at prespecified levels while delivering competitive type II error performance, providing reliable tools for asymmetric-risk decisions with complex molecular tensors."

In particular, this allows to determine the relevant coefficients in the coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations from the underlying kinetic network problem.

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed."

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $ε\\sim\\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $η\\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(μ_{1},μ_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials. Thus the near scale--invariance of primordial perturbations emerges as a structural property of the unfolding of the organising centre, providing a potential--independent mechanism for an early phase of accelerated expansion. We discuss the implications of this geometric framework for the interpretation and classification of inflationary models."

In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region. Differences of relative entropies with respect to this weight give differences in generalized entropies. This provides an algebraic understanding of the order parameter that controls the phase transitions between entanglement wedges. We emphasize the role of operator-valued weights used in our construction."

    "abstract": "Swarmalators are active agents that move in position space and exhibit internal degrees of freedom. Due to interactions of their positions and phases of oscillation, they show on the one hand swarming, similar to the effect of flocking of birds. In addition, they exhibit synchronization behavior, analogous to what has been observed in fireflies. Previous works studied scenarios in which the phases are forced externally. Here, we consider a pseudo-force that acts on the positions of the swarmalators. Due to the resulting attraction towards the center of position space, transitions from the splintered and active phase-wave state to the static antisynchronized state are found. To quantify the crystal order of swarmalators, we introduce an order parameter that is based on the Fourier transform of their positions."

    "abstract": "Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

Numerical simulation of a model CuZr alloy reveal that $d_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ increases upon cooling but saturates near the first peak of the radial distribution function just before SE breakdown. This saturation defines a geometric upper bound for the collisional cross-section beyond which further slowdown is governed by cooperative, heterogeneous motion rather than local collisional transport. Our analysis yields a compact criterion for SE breakdown in a mean-field perspective and provides physically interpretable inputs for future data-driven models of glassy dynamics."

The HOD from the best-fit HOMe has the following properties: (i) 90.50% (85.91%) of ELGs (LRGs) are central galaxies without satellites, residing in halos of $M_{\\rm vir}\\sim6.6\\times10^{11}\\,(1.2\\times10^{13})\\,h^{-1}{\\rm M}_\\odot$; (ii) the ELG$\\times$LRG cross-correlation is governed by central-central pairs and shaped by halo exclusion on $2-5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc scales; (iii) 9.50% (14.09%) of ELGs (LRGs) are satellites, of which 1.09% (3.52%) inhabit halos with a central galaxy of the same species in a maximally conformal configuration, 7.02% (0.005%) orbit complementary hosts in a minimally conformal state, and 0.58% (10.57%) are orphans.

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing."

Mutual locking between the array elements results in coherent single-spectrum oscillation and a narrow radiation beam. However, frequency variation between elements disturbs the mutual locking. In this paper, the frequency variation that can be tolerated for mutual locking is approximately derived for an array with arbitrary coupling configuration. Using this result, the element-number dependence of the frequency variation tolerance for 1D and 2D arrays is calculated. In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays."

In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment."

    "abstract": "Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools."

However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $ρ_{a}(0)$ and $ρ_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $ρ_{t}(0) \\to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $ρ_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached."

    "abstract": "Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks.

Our method is based on the G-minimal model program for surfaces and on the Sarkisov link factorisation of birational maps between Mori fibre spaces. We characterise rationality of surfaces, and in certain cases, birationality between surfaces in terms of the pieces of these decompositions, which we call atoms."

Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \\cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications."

We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional brightness profile with extrema along the line connecting the two sources, with an effective PSF width that depends on the relative orientation of the PSF and its degree of elongation. The problem can then be expressed in units of this effective width to be a function of the relative separation and light ratio alone (thus reducing to a rescaling of the un-elongated case). We derive the minimum light ratio, for a given separation and effective width, above which two sources will be resolved. We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise."

A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime. Yet, it has become clear that our ignorance of the structure of the Galactic magnetic fields, both on large and small scales, is limiting precision predictions. Turning this problem into an opportunity though, we can use Galactic cosmic rays as a laboratory for the study of Galactic magnetic fields.

Using a two-part econometric panel model, we estimate the causal effect of power outage exposure and project future risks under a middle of the road climate scenario (RCP 4.5). We find that each additional hour of annual outage duration per household lowers the new-installation rate by 0.012 percentage points per year, equivalent to a 31% decline relative to the historical mean (2014-2023). With outage duration and frequency projected to double by 2040, these results reveal a potential vicious cycle between grid unreliability and slower decarbonization, calling for policies that integrate grid resilience and clean-energy goals."

We classify the resulting wormholes, analyze their horizons, throat structure and embedding properties, and we identify the exotic energy needed at the minimal surface. Imposing the ER=EPR requirement of non-traversability and the absence of a macroscopic throat, we find that only the zero-throat geometry is compatible with an entanglement-induced Einstein-Rosen bridge, providing a concrete realization of ER=EPR within a fully regular spacetime.

Unlike most SMEFT interpretation of Drell-Yan measurements, dominated by growing-with-energy effects generated by the interference of SMEFT-induced and SM amplitudes, this method isolates operators that contribute only quadratically in the Wilson coefficients, allowing for an independent probe of non-interfering operators. Denoting with $v$ the electroweak vev, with $\\sqrt{s}$ the center-of-mass energy, and with $Λ$ the scale of new physics, the non-interfering contributions to the amplitude generated by the chirality-breaking operators can be proportional to $v\\sqrt{s}/Λ^{2}$ or $s/Λ^{2}$. We argue that these two classes can be further distinguished by analyzing the angular observables of the lepton pair in the transverse momentum and in the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pair. We therefore present an analysis of the lepton-pair angular observables in both these distributions. Based on a precise estimate of the Standard Model contribution to the relevant observables for the $pp\\to l^{+}l^{-}+X$ process up to $O(α_{S}^{2})$, we present realistic projections for the sensitivity of the LHC with $300$ fb$^{-1}$ and for the HL-LHC with $3$ ab$^{-1}$ to chirality-breaking interactions, demonstrating that angular observables provide an independent and clean handle on SMEFT effects, especially in regions where the Standard Model contribution is naturally suppressed thanks to the Lam-Tung relation. This analysis becomes crucial to go beyond single parameter global fits, since it helps breaking degeneracies with chirality preserving operators and to disentangle overlapping directions in the EFT parameter space."

    "abstract": "We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression."

We present Adaptive Homeostatic Spiking Activity Regulation (AHSAR), an extremely simple plug in and training paradigm agnostic method that stabilizes optimization and accelerates convergence without changing the model architecture, loss, or gradients. AHSAR introduces no trainable parameters. It maintains a per layer homeostatic state during the forward pass, maps centered firing rate deviations to threshold scales through a bounded nonlinearity, uses lightweight cross layer diffusion to avoid sharp imbalance, and applies a slow across epoch global gain that combines validation progress with activity energy to tune the operating point. The computational cost is negligible. Across diverse training methods, SNN architectures of different depths, widths, and temporal steps, and both RGB and DVS datasets, AHSAR consistently improves strong baselines and enhances out of distribution robustness. These results indicate that keeping layer activity within a moderate band is a simple and effective principle for scalable and efficient SNN training."

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \\to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects."

A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments. This work establishes a hierarchical simulation pipeline that advances robust, terrain-aware locomotion for robots operating in challenging unstructured settings."

The essence of our investigation is whether the dimension data of irreducible representations of a finite group can be ``geometerized'', to become equal to the cardinality of certain orbit spaces. The first part of this paper deals with nilpotent and reductive groups over finite fields, whereas the second part deals with the symmetric group $S_n$. The main conclusion that we want to bring out to contrast these two cases is that for reductive groups over finite fields, the dimension data is concentrated (in a statistical sense) in a neighborhood of the maximal dimension, whereas for the symmetric group, it is spread out."

We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks.

Inspired by this adaptability, we developed a transhumeral prosthesis with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) to replicate the controllable compliance found in biological joints. The proposed prosthesis features a modular design, allowing customization for different residual limb shapes and accommodating a range of independent control signals derived from users' biological cues. Integrated elastic elements passively support more natural movements, facilitate safe interactions with the environment, and adapt to diverse task requirements.

This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy."

Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios. Finally, we illustrate the scalability and versatility of our approach by successfully applying it to other pre-trained ViTs, such as DINOv2."

    "abstract": "Automated retinal disease diagnosis is vital given the rising prevalence of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions."

    "abstract": "The main focus of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is studying how large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be more efficiently solved when addressed in a modular way, by combining partial solutions computed for smaller subtasks. Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction."

An open problem raised by Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou is whether MAX BISECTION can be approximated as well as MAX CUT, i.e., to within ${α_{GW}}\\approx 0.8785672\\ldots$, which is the approximation ratio achieved by the celebrated Goemans-Williamson algorithm for MAX CUT, which is best possible assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). They conjectured that the answer is yes. The current paradigm for obtaining approximation algorithms for MAX BISECTION, due to Raghavendra and Tan and Austrin, Benabbas, and Georgiou, follows a two-phase approach. First, a large number of rounds of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy is used to find a solution to the ``Basic SDP'' relaxation of MAX CUT which is $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated, for an arbitrarily small $\\varepsilon > 0$. Second, standard SDP rounding techniques (such as ${\\cal THRESH}$) are used to round this $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution, producing with high probability a cut that is almost balanced, i.e., a cut that has at most $\\frac12+\\varepsilon$ fraction of the vertices on each side. This cut is then converted into an exact bisection of the graph with only a small loss. In this paper, we show that this two-stage paradigm cannot be used to obtain an $α_{GW}$-approximation algorithm for MAX BISECTION if one relies only on the $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelatedness property of the solution produced by the first phase. More precisely, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, we construct an explicit instance of MAX BISECTION for which the ratio between the value of the optimal integral solution and the value of some $\\varepsilon$-uncorrelated solution of the Basic SDP relaxation is less than $0.87853 < {α_{GW}}$. Our instances are also integrality gaps for the Basic SDP relaxation of MAX BISECTION."

We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5. We also compute the one-loop world-volume scattering amplitudes for the two theories, finding that they indeed agree for $D=4,5$ but disagree for $D=11$."

    "abstract": "A new strategy for detecting cracks in 2D solids based on strain data is introduced. Crack detection is formulated as an inverse problem and solved using genetic optimization. The novelty lies in the evaluation of the model response at each generation. Specifically, the solution to the corresponding plane elasticity problem is expressed via holomorphic potentials, which are determined by training two holomorphic neural networks. As the potentials satisfy equilibrium and traction-free conditions along the crack faces a priori, the training proceeds quickly based solely on boundary information. Training efficiency is further improved by splitting the genetic search into long-range and short-range stages, enabling the use of transfer learning in the latter. The new strategy is tested on three benchmark problems, showing that an optimal number of training epochs exists that provides the best overall performance. A comparison is also made with a popular crack detection approach that uses XFEM to compute the model response. Under the assumption of identical stress-field representation accuracy, the proposed method is found to be between 7 and 23 times faster than the XFEM-based approach. While the strategy is presented here for the simplified case of a single internal crack, generalization is feasible. Overall, the present findings demonstrate that combining genetic optimization with holomorphic neural networks and transfer learning offers a promising avenue for developing crack detection strategies with higher efficiency than those currently available."

    "abstract": "The observational GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728) enrolled adult people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) <=6.5. PwMS performed the U-Turn Test (UTT), a smartphone-based assessment of dynamic balance, in a gait laboratory (supervised setting) using 6 smartphones at different body locations and daily during a 2-week remote period (unsupervised setting) using 1 smartphone. In the supervised setting, the accuracy of detecting turns with smartphones was compared against turns detected with a motion capture system (mocap) using F1 scores. Agreement between turn speed measured with smartphones and mocap was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC[3,1]) and bias. In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability was assessed by ICC(2,1), and correlations with clinical and patient-reported measures by Spearman rank correlation. Ninety-six PwMS were included. In the supervised setting, turns were detected with high accuracy (F1 scores >95% across smartphone wear locations). Smartphone-derived turn speed was comparable across the supervised (1.44 rad/s) and unsupervised settings (1.47 rad/s), and with mocap-derived turn speed (1.47 rad/s). ICC(3,1) revealed high agreement between smartphone- and mocap-derived turn speed (ICC[3,1]: 0.87-0.92 across smartphone wear locations). Bias was minimal (-0.04 to 0.11 rad/s). In the unsupervised setting, test-retest reliability (ICC[2,1]) was >0.90 when aggregating >=2 tests. The UTT correlated with Timed 25-Foot Walk gait speed, EDSS, Ambulation score, 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (r=-0.79 to -0.61). The UTT measures turn speed accurately and reproducibly irrespective of smartphone wear location and settings. These findings affirm its potential as a valuable tool in multiple sclerosis trials."

    "abstract": "Categorical resolutions of singularities are a replacement of resolution of singularities within the realm of triangulated categories. They allow the study of the derived category of a singular variety $X$ via a triangulated category that behaves like the derived category of a smooth variety. We follow these ideas to study the bounded derived category of a singular, reduced curve $C$ (with arbitrary singularities and number of components). We start by describing an explicit categorical resolution of singularities, specializing a general construction of Kuznetsov and Lunts. We prove the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions on these categories. As a consequence, we get the existence of proper, good moduli spaces of semistable objects. If the curve $C$ is irreducible, then we relate these moduli spaces to the moduli of slope-semistable torsion-free sheaves on $C$, and to the moduli of slope-semistable vector bundles on the (geometric) resolution $\\tilde{C}$. This extends classical constructions by Oda and Seshadri, Bhosle and many others. Finally, we use these results to give explicit descriptions of the moduli of torsion-free sheaves on a curve with a single node, cusp, or tacnode."

Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\\rm \\left<W1-W2\\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is a key technology in non-cooperative communication systems, aiming to identify the modulation scheme from signals without prior information. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have gained wide attention due to their excellent performance, but research mainly focuses on single-input single-output (SISO) systems, with limited exploration for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The confounding effects of multi-antenna channels can interfere with the statistical properties of MIMO signals, making identification particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Channel-Aware Multi-Domain feature extraction (CAMD) framework for AMR in MIMO systems. Our CAMD framework reconstructs the transmitted signal through an efficient channel compensation module and achieves a more robust representation capability against channel interference by extracting and integrating multi-domain features, including intra-antenna temporal correlations and inter-antenna channel correlations. We have verified our method on the widely-used dataset, MIMOSig-Ref, with complex mobile channel environments. Extensive experiments confirm the performance advantages of CAMD over previous state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "The total energy is a fundamental characteristic of solids, molecules, and nanostructures. In most first-principles calculations of the total energy, the nuclear kinetic operator is decoupled from the many-body electronic Hamiltonian and the dynamics of the nuclei is reintroduced afterwards. This two-step procedure introduced by Born and Oppenheimer (BO) is approximate. Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph. We also estimate the electronic inertial mass contribution and confirm the size-consistency of all computed terms."

Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains. Crucially, E(3)-Pose achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on clinical MRI volumes, paving the way for clinical translation. Our implementation is available at github.com/ramyamut/E3-Pose."

    "abstract": "Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use."

    "abstract": "Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle."

We show that DFT supports the main conclusions of the 2$k_0$ theory, but reveals some limitations of semi-empirical methods such as the EM and TB, in particular about the description of atomistic disorder. The DFT calculations also highlight the effects of strong valley-orbit mixing at large valley splittings.

This formalism utilized both Coulomb continuum and confluent hypergeometric functions to describe the scattering states involved. Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model. The results of this work can be used as benchmarking for the development of more complex distorted wave and multi-scattering theories in excited state ionization processes."

    "abstract": "Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches."

Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz. Our results suggest the potential of utilizing coupler-based architectures for large scale fault-tolerant spin qubit processors based on resonant singlet-triplet qubits."

We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning. SSU also achieves target-language performance highly competitive with full fine-tuning, outperforming it on all benchmarks for 7B models and the majority for 13B models."

To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis."

When the feasibility set is nonempty, we compute the minimum-norm perturbation $ΔH$ such that $(H+ΔH)x=λx$. When no such perturbation exists, we compute the nearest nonnegative Hankel matrix in a residual sense by minimizing $\\|(H+ΔH)x-λx\\|_{2}$ subject to the imposed constraints.

Based on this analysis, we introduce a set of fourteen corruption functions that generate incorrect sentences by systematically introducing errors into existing correct Danish sentences. To ensure the accuracy of these corruptions, we assess their validity using both manual and automatic methods. The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones. Our results also suggest that our benchmark has a higher discriminatory power which allows to better distinguish well-performing models from low-performing ones."

Built upon a Gemini foundation model, SIMA 2 represents a significant step toward active, goal-directed interaction within an embodied environment. Unlike prior work (e.g., SIMA 1) limited to simple language commands, SIMA 2 acts as an interactive partner, capable of reasoning about high-level goals, conversing with the user, and handling complex instructions given through language and images. Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment. This work validates a path toward creating versatile and continuously learning agents for both virtual and, eventually, physical worlds."

    "abstract": "Generating high-fidelity, seamless textures directly on 3D surfaces, what we term 3D-native texturing, remains a fundamental open challenge, with the potential to overcome long-standing limitations of UV-based and multi-view projection methods. However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows."

Our method employs a motorized kinematic mirror to generate a sequence of controlled, multi-angle plane-wave illuminations, with each resulting oblique-illumination intensity image encoding a limited portion of the spatial-frequency content of the target imaging sample. These measurements are combined in the Fourier domain using an aberration-corrected iterative phase-retrieval algorithm integrated with an efficient illumination calibration scheme, which enables the reconstruction of resolution-enhanced amplitude and phase images through the synthetic expansion of the effective numerical aperture. Our work establishes a robust framework for high-resolution THz imaging and paves the way for a wide array of applications in materials characterization, spectroscopy, and non-destructive evaluation."

In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest."

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works. Moreover, due to the effective alleviation of the generation bottleneck, RLHFSpec also shows significant performance speedup in the entire RLHF execution."

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models. For instance, on the MATH500 task, TTSV achieves a 45.88% relative performance gain on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% relative gain on the Qwen3-4B model. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust generalization, with its steering vectors proving highly transferable across diverse tasks."

Under assumptions including a lower bound on Ricci curvature, an upper bound on diameter, and an $L^{2p}$-norm bound on the Riemann curvature tensor, we prove that $λ^{(1)}_{1}$ is bounded below by a positive constant depending on these parameters. As applications, we derive vanishing results for the Euler characteristic under certain Ricci curvature bounds and the presence of a nonzero Killing vector field, extending classical Bochner-type theorems."

While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels."

We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions. Across real-world datasets, E3AD improves visual grounding and waypoint planning and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) VAD correlation for emotion estimation. These results show that injecting emotion into VLA-style driving yields more human-aligned grounding, planning, and human-centric feedback."

    "abstract": "Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization."

Subsequently, we highlight that reliable, model-independent $κ$ values can be obtained by applying Onsager's reciprocal relations to correctly capture the coupled heat and mass transport. Remarkably, an anomalously invariant $κ$ is observed over a wide temperature range, distinct from the characteristic trends in traditional crystals and glasses.

Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability."

These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies."

However, molecular insights into these interactions are lacking due to the absence of force field parameters for Se-S containing compounds. In this study, we present force field parameters for selenenyl sulfides with a phenyl selenide backbone developed using the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). Employing these parameters, a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of RSeSG was performed. The results indicate that both the amino nitrogen and its substituent significantly influence the interaction of RSeSG at the catalytic site of GR."

    "abstract": "We investigate the stellar velocity dispersion functions (VDFs) of pressure-supported galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulations. The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one \"standard\", two \"enhanced\", one \"reduced\", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($σ_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $σ_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys."

    "abstract": "Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology."

    "abstract": "This study challenges the traditional binary view of student progression (retention versus dropout) by conceptualising academic trajectories as complex, quantised pathways. Utilising a 40-year longitudinal dataset from an Argentine engineering faculty (N = 24,016), we introduce CAPIRE, an analytical framework that differentiates between degree major switches, curriculum plan changes, and same-plan re-entries. While 73.3 per cent of students follow linear trajectories (Estables), a significant 26.7 per cent exhibit complex mobility patterns. By applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and DBSCAN clustering, we reveal that these trajectories are not continuous but structurally quantised, occupying discrete bands of complexity. The analysis identifies six distinct student archetypes, including 'Switchers' (10.7 per cent) who reorient vocationally, and 'Stable Re-entrants' (6.9 per cent) who exhibit stop-out behaviours without changing discipline. Furthermore, network analysis highlights specific 'hub majors' - such as electronics and computing - that act as systemic attractors. These findings suggest that student flux is an organised ecosystemic feature rather than random noise, offering institutions a new lens for curriculum analytics and predictive modelling."

First, an exploitation-oriented MPC (EO-MPC) is proposed, integrating real-time sampling data with robust set-based parameter estimation techniques to address the critical challenge of parameter identification. By introducing virtual excitation signals into the terminal constraint and establishing a validation mechanism for persistent excitation condition, the EO-MPC effectively resolves the issue of insufficient persistent excitation in parameter identification. Building upon this foundation, an active learning MPC (AL-MPC) approach is developed to integrate both available and virtual future data to resolve the fundamental conflict between tracking an unknown optimal operational condition and parameter identification. The recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed methods are rigorously established, and numerous examples substantiate the reliability and effectiveness of the approach in practical applications."

    "abstract": "We construct a canonical geometric rough path over $d$-dimensional tempered fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) for any Hurst parameter $H > 1/4$ and tempering parameter $λ> 0$. The main challenge stems from the non-homogeneous nature of the tfBm covariance, which exhibits a power-law structure at small scales and exponential decay at large scales. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of this covariance, proving it has finite 2D $ρ$-variation for $ρ= 1/(2H)$. This verifies the criterion of Friz and Victoir, guaranteeing the existence of a rough path lift. We then provide an explicit construction of the rough path $\\mathbf{B}_{H,λ} = (B_{H,λ}, \\mathbb{B}_{H,λ})$ via $L^2$-limits, establishing its basic properties with explicit constants $C(H,λ,T)$. As direct consequences, we obtain: (i) a complete characterization of integration regimes, with Young integration applicable for $H > 1/2$ and rough path theory necessary and sufficient for $H \\in (1/4, 1/2]$; (ii) the well-posedness of rough differential equations driven by tfBm; and (iii) the foundation for signature calculus for tfBm, including the existence and factorial decay of the signature. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-2H})$ for the Lévy area approximation and $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-H})$ for the associated Milstein scheme. This work provides the first comprehensive pathwise framework for stochastic calculus with tfBm."

Using the open-source PyPSA framework, we model sector-coupled electricity and heating systems, and evaluate individual and district heating configurations for heat provision at residential level, with and without PHPS waste heat recovery. Our results show that PHPS is most viable in individual heating systems, and in wind-dominated locations, where its low cost per energy capacity enables it to balance long-duration fluctuations. Moreover, waste heat recovery is essential to enhance PHPS competitiveness, allowing it to displace lithium-ion batteries. Conversely, PHPS is largely outcompeted in district heating systems, which favour low-cost centralized energy storage. Sensitivity analysis highlights that PHPS viability depends primarily on achieving low energy capacity costs and maintaining reasonable heat-to-power conversion efficiencies. Overall, while PHPS complements existing storage technologies by providing dispatchable electricity and heat, its potential adoption is highly context-dependent, influenced by climate, heating system configuration, and competing storage costs."

However, centuries-long data series reveal that the O-C diagrams of Blazhko stars exhibit particularly large-amplitude, irregular variations. In this Letter, we extend the previous investigation of non-Blazhko stars to Kepler Blazhko stars to explore the role of C2C variations in the O-C diagrams. We derived the O-C diagrams from Kepler space telescope light curves using a precise template-fitting method. Based on their Fourier analyses, we also constructed residual O-C diagrams that were pre-whitened for frequencies associated with the Blazhko effect. We then fitted the same statistical models to both types of O-Cs that we had previously applied to non-Blazhko stars. The optimal statistical model includes the C2C variation for 74% of the O-C curves in our Blazhko sample, and the parameter describing the strength of the C2C variation is significantly larger than that obtained for non-Blazhko stars. This may explain the strong irregular O-C variations previously observed in Blazhko stars. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between the C2C variation strength and the amplitude of the frequency-modulation component of the Blazhko effect, indicating a connection between the two phenomena."

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce HeFT (Head-Frequency Tracker), a zero-shot point tracking framework that leverages the visual priors of pretrained video diffusion models. To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models."

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use."

    "abstract": "Following recent advances in combining approximation algorithms with fixed-parameter tractability (FPT), we study FPT-time approximation algorithms for minimum-norm $k$-clustering problems, parameterized by the number $k$ of open facilities. For the capacitated setting, we give a tight $(3+ε)$-approximation for the general-norm capacitated $k$-clustering problem in FPT-time parameterized by $k$ and $ε$. Prior to our work, such a result was only known for the capacitated $k$-median problem [CL, ICALP, 2019]. As a special case, our result yields an FPT-time $3$-approximation for capacitated $k$-center. The problem has not been studied in the FPT-time setting, with the previous best known polynomial-time approximation ratio being 9 [ABCG, MP, 2015]. In the uncapacitated setting, we consider the $top$-$cn$ norm $k$-clustering problem, where the goal of the problem is to minimize the $top$-$cn$ norm of the connection distance vector. Our main result is a tight $\\big(1 + \\frac 2{ec} + ε\\big)$-approximation algorithm for the problem with $c \\in \\big(\\frac1e, 1\\big]$. (For the case $c \\leq \\frac1e$, there is a simple tight $(3+ε)$-approximation.) Our framework can be easily extended to give a tight $\\left(3, 1+\\frac2e + ε\\right)$-bicriteria approximation for the ($k$-center, $k$-median) problem in FPT time, improving the previous best polynomial-time $(4, 8)$ guarantee [AB, WAOA, 2017]. All results are based on a unified framework: computing a $(1+ε)$-approximate solution using $O\\left(\\frac{k\\log n}ε\\right)$ facilities $S$ via LP rounding, sampling a few client representatives $R$ based on the solution $S$, guessing a few pivots from $S \\cup R$ and some radius information on the pivots, and solving the problem using the guesses. We believe this framework can lead to further results on $k$-clustering problems."

The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $η= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete."

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here."

To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals. We believe LexGenius can assess the legal intelligence abilities of LLMs and enhance legal GI development. Our project is available at https://github.com/QwenQKing/LexGenius."

    "abstract": "Highly resolved simulations reveal the fundamental influence of a carrier fluid's flow dynamics on triboelectric powder charging. We found that particles transported through a square-shaped duct charge faster than in a channel flow caused by secondary flows that led to more severe particle-wall collisions. Specifically, particles with a Stokes number of 4.69 achieve 85 % of their equilibrium charge approximately 1.5 times faster in duct flow than in channel flow. Also, charge distribution is more uniform in a duct cross-section compared with a channel cross-section. In channel flow, particles are trapped near the walls and collide frequently due to limited movement in the wall-normal direction, causing localized charge buildup. In contrast, duct flow promotes better mixing through secondary flows, reducing repeating collisions and providing uniform charge distribution across the cross-section. Upon charging, electrostatic forces significantly reshape particle behaviour and distribution. Once the powder achieves half of its equilibrium charge, particles increasingly accumulate at the wall, leading to a reduced concentration in the central region. These changes in particle distribution have a noticeable impact on the surrounding fluid phase and alter the overall flow dynamics. These findings open the possibility for a new measure to control powder charging by imposing a specific pattern."

We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario."

This paper proposes a new algorithm that overcomes these drawbacks for a particular class of discrete-time systems. This algorithm leverages direct Model-Reference Adaptive Control (direct MRAC) and combines it with an epoch-based approach in order to address the drawbacks (i)-(iii) with a provable high-probability regret bound comparable to existing literature.

    "abstract": "Image convolution with complex kernels is a fundamental operation in photography, scientific imaging, and animation effects, yet direct dense convolution is computationally prohibitive on resource-limited devices. Existing approximations, such as simulated annealing or low-rank decompositions, either lack efficiency or fail to capture non-convex kernels. We introduce a differentiable kernel decomposition framework that represents a target spatially-variant, dense, complex kernel using a set of sparse kernel samples. Our approach features (i) a decomposition that enables differentiable optimization of sparse kernels, (ii) a dedicated initialization strategy for non-convex shapes to avoid poor local minima, and (iii) a kernel-space interpolation scheme that extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining and additional runtime overhead. Experiments on Gaussian and non-convex kernels show that our method achieves higher fidelity than simulated annealing and significantly lower cost than low-rank decompositions. Our approach provides a practical solution for mobile imaging and real-time rendering, while remaining fully differentiable for integration into broader learning pipelines."

    "abstract": "One of the possible ways to detect the new physics phenomena particles is to investigate the weak gauge boson production as a result of hadron-hadron scattering. This study comprises the production of multiple weak gauge bosons as a result of hard scattering between the proton-proton beams at multi-TeV energies and integrated luminosity $\\mathcal L =$ 3000 $fb ^{-1}$. The effective production cross-sections for pair, triple, and quartic scattering mechanisms have been computed as a function of $\\sqrt s$. The center of mass energy has been varied from 8 TeV to 100 TeV to encompass the future collider capabilities. Out of all the studied processes, the triple scattering process $W^+W^-W^+$ has been chosen as the signal process based on the dominant cross-section. The background channels ZZZ, ZZZZ, $W^-ZZ$, $W^+ZZ$, $W^+W^-Z$, $W^+W^-ZZ$, $W^+W^-W^+W^-$, having comparatively lower cross-sections, have been selected from possible scattering mechanisms to investigate the effect of higher luminosity on the low production cross-section processes. We have investigated the different decay modes. For both lepton and hadron-specific decays of W and Z, the cumulative efficiencies for each signal and background process have been computed. In this study, we have successfully demonstrated an effective methodology for background suppression by systematically optimizing the signal-to-background ratio. The results indicate that, despite lower cross-sections for higher-order scattering, the distinct kinematic features enable effective signal isolation at future colliders."

    "abstract": "Differentiable reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks like DiffRO offer a powerful approach for controllable text-to-speech (TTS), but are vulnerable to reward hacking, particularly for nuanced tasks like emotion control. The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

    "abstract": "Ultra long video understanding remains an open challenge, as existing vision language models (VLMs) falter on such content due to limited context length and inefficient long term memory retention. To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks."

    "abstract": "As code completion task from function-level to repository-level, leveraging contextual information from large-scale codebases becomes a core challenge. However, existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods typically treat code as plain natural language, relying primarily on shallow semantic matching while overlooking structural semantics and code-specific dependencies. This limits their ability to capture control flow and underlying intent, ultimately constraining the quality of generated code. Therefore, we propose CoCo, a novel framework that enables code Completion by Comprehension of multi-granularity context from large-scale code repositories. CoCo employs static code analysis to extract structured context at the function, file, and project levels, capturing execution logic and semantic dependencies. It then adopts an graph-based multi-granularity context selection mechanism to filter out redundant information and remove noise. Consequently, the information is converted into natural language in a consistent manner, thereby functioning as explicit contextual prompts to guide subsequent code completion. Additionally, a structure-aware code re-ranker mechanism ensures alignment at both semantic and structural levels. Extensive experiments on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 20.2% gains in EM. Moreover, the framework is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods, leading to significant performance."

However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability. Our results establish GTM as a foundational component for developing future AI agents, enabling efficient and scalable training of tool-augmented systems."

In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refaçade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos. Second, we disrupt the reference global layout using a jigsaw permutation, encouraging the model to focus on local texture statistics rather than the global layout of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, precise editing, and controllability, outperforming strong baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmark the sensitivity of our method and compare it with existing search pipelines. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach has comparable sensitivity for injections with a source-frame chirp mass greater than 25$\\,$M$_{\\odot}$, and below this threshold our sensitivity drops off for signals with a network SNR less than 15. We also observe that our search method can identify a significant population of unique candidates.

We identify two other candidates: one previously reported only in a search conducted by the Institute for Advanced Study, and one previously unreported promising new candidate with a $p_{\\rm astro}$ of 0.63. This unique candidate has a high chirp mass and a high probability that the primary black hole is an intermediate-mass black hole."

It is remarkable that the critical Fujita exponent is not determined by the usual scaling argument that yields $p_{sc}=1+(β+α)/n$, but instead arises in an unconventional manner, similar to the results of Cazenave et al. [Nonlinear Analysis, 68 (2008), 862-874] for the heat equation with a nonlocal nonlinearity of the form $\\int_0^t(t-s)^{-γ}|u(s)|^{p-1}u(s)ds,\\,0\\leq γ<1.$ The result on global existence for $p>p_{\\mathrm{Fuj}}(n,2,α),$ provides a positive answer to the hypothesis proposed by Mitidieri and Pohozaev in [Proc.

The state-space constraints, such as polyhedral waypoints to be visited and obstacles to be avoided, are also transformed into the moment space, leading to a unified formulation for safe, large-scale ensemble control. Expressive signal temporal logic specifications are employed to encode complex visit-avoid tasks, which are achieved through a single shared controller synthesized from our constrained ensemble control formulation.

MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction.

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds.

Overall, KAI reduces end-to-end runtime by up to 50.4%, and CCM and host idle times by average 22.11x and 3.85x, respectively."

However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset."

    "abstract": "End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of \"context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off\". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned \"what-if\" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Why do firms produce scientific research and make it available to the public, including their rivals? Prior literature has emphasized the tension between imitation risks from disclosure and scientists' preferences for publication. This study examines an additional managerial consideration: the value of follow-on research conducted by external scientists building upon firms' publications. Using data on U.S. public firms' scientific publications from 1990 to 2012, and a novel instrumental variable based on quasi-random journal issue assignment, I find that accumulation of follow-on research is associated with increased subsequent scientific investments, improved patenting outcomes, and greater employee retention by the originating firms. Benefits are more pronounced for firms with complementary assets and those operating in emerging research fields. Beyond serving as direct input into innovation, follow-on research provides external validation of internal research programs, helping managers allocate resources under conditions of scientific uncertainty. These findings demonstrate that firms benefit when their scientific disclosures inspire follow-on research by the broader scientific community."

As applications, we prove that the LLN for $θ$-sums and $θ$-corners of random matrices are given by the free convolution and free projection, respectively, regardless of the value of inverse temperature parameter $θ$.

In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization."

These quasibound states (and consequently the spectral lines in the absorption spectrum) can be related to stable light rings in the spacetime, a structure often associated with horizonless exotic compact objects, such as wormholes. We investigate how the gravitational decoupling method introduces novel light ring structures in hairy black holes and influences the absorption spectra through its deformation parameters. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with well-known approximations."

    "abstract": "Autonomous landing on sloped terrain poses significant challenges for small, lightweight spacecraft, such as rotorcraft and landers. These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft."

To further enhance their magnetization intensities, (Ln0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)MnO3 (Ln = Dy, Ho and Er, labeled as Ln-LNSEMO) HEPCs are designed based on the configuration entropy Sconfig, tolerance factor t, and mismatch degree. Single-phase HEPCs are synthesized by the solid-phase method in this work, in which the effects of the heavy rare-earth elements Dy, Ho and Er on the structure and magnetic properties of Ln-LNSEMO are systematically studied. The results show that all Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit high crystallinity and maintain excellent structural stability after sintering at 1250 degree centigrade for 16 h. Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit significant lattice distortion effects, with smooth surface morphology, clearly distinguishable grain boundaries, and irregular polygonal shapes. The three high-entropy ceramic samples exhibit hysteresis behavior at T = 5 K, with the Curie temperature TC decreasing as the radius of the introduced rare-earth ions decreases, while the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase accordingly. When the average ionic radius of A-site decreases, the interaction between their valence electrons and local electrons in the crystal increases, thereby enhancing the conversion of electrons to oriented magnetic moments under an external magnetic field. Thus, Er-LNSEMO HEPC shows a higher saturation magnetization strength (42.8 emu/g) and coercivity (2.09 kOe) than the other samples, which is attributed to the strong magnetic crystal anisotropy, larger lattice distortion (0.00652), smaller average grain size (440.49 plus or minus 22.02 nm), unit cell volume (229.432 A3) and A-site average ion radius (1.24 A) of its magnet. The Er-LNSEMO HEPC has potential applications in magnetic recording materials."

    "abstract": "Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs."

In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems."

While asymptotic analysis predicts a precision advantage for SE over joint estimation (JE) in regimes where the quantum Fisher information matrix is near-singular (\"sloppy\" models), we demonstrate that this advantage is mitigated within a practical Bayesian framework with limited resources. We experimentally implement a SE protocol using polarisation qubits, achieving uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds. However, comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for JE reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic SE advantage. Nevertheless, the stepwise strategy retains a significant practical benefit as it operates effectively with simple, fixed measurements, whereas saturating the JE bound typically requires complex, parameter-dependent operations."

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

The simulations extend up to 150 ms which allows us to assess the role of the treatment of finite-temperature effects on the dynamics of the hypermassive neutron star remnant. Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-Høiland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors. The late-time excitation of inertial modes, previously reported in studies based on hybrid EOS, is fully supported by the tabulated, finite-temperature EOS simulations presented here, which account for thermal effects in a more consistent way."

The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $τ$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2σ$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $α$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $α$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $τ$."

The ALMA data reveal no dust continuum emission, consistent with previous observations. The high line luminosity ratio of [OIII]/[CII] $\\sim 14\\pm5$ is consistent with A383-5.1 being low-metallicity and dust-poor. The non-detection of dust continuum in bands 6 and 8 is consistent with the high [OIII]/[CII] ratio and suggests a presence of a strong ultraviolet radiation field, which would be less affect by dust attenuation, implying that galaxies of this type could contribute significantly to the ionization of the intergalactic medium. The presence of strong ionizing field could provide an important piece of information for understanding the nature of LRDs and their role in cosmic reionization."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance on tasks such as visual grounding and visual question answering. However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path."

    "abstract": "Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators have emerged as a powerful tool for compact and coherent frequency comb generation. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems."

This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems. This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown. We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals. Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations."

The experiment employed the CLAS detector with a 5-GeV electron beam incident on deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead targets. For heavier nuclei, the pion-proton correlation function is more spread-out in azimuth than for lighter ones, and this effect is more pronounced in the $πp$ channel than in earlier $ππ$ studies. The proton-to-pion yield ratio likewise rises with nuclear mass, although the increase appears to saturate for the heaviest targets. These trends are qualitatively reproduced by state-of-the-art $eA$ event generators, including BeAGLE, eHIJING, and GiBUU, indicating that current descriptions of target fragmentation rest on sound theoretical footing. At the same time, the precision of our data exposes model-dependent discrepancies, delineating a clear path for future improvements in the treatment of cold-nuclear matter effects in $eA$ scattering."

Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training. OMTRA obtains state of the art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking; however, the effects of large-scale pretraining and multi-task training are modest.

Yet, object reconstruction is a challenging task because cameras only capture partial observations of objects, especially when occlusion occurs. In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization."

While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties."

These solutions develop a degenerate neckpinch singularity, meaning that the tangent flow at a singularity is a round cylinder, but at the same time for each of these solutions there exists a sequence of points in space and time, so that the pointed blow up limit around this sequence is the Bowl soliton. These solutions are called peanut solutions and they were first conjectured to exist by Richard Hamilton, while the existence of those solutions was shown by Angenent, Altschuler and Giga. In this paper we show that this type of solutions are highly unstable, in the sense that in every small neighborhood of any such peanut solution we can find a perturbation so that the mean curvature flow starting at that perturbation develops spherical singularity, and at the same time we can find a perturbation so that the mean curvature flow starting at that perturbation develops a nondegenerate neckpinch singularity. We also show that appropriately rescaled subsequence of any sequence of solutions whose initial data converge to the peanut solution, and all of which develop spherical singularities, converges to the Ancient oval solution."

This study explores the anisotropic thermal behavior of metamaterials composed of planar plates perforated with periodic arrays of cylinders possessing elliptical cross sections. In contrast to conventional circular perforations, elliptical geometries inherently break rotational symmetry, introducing anisotropy in the effective electromagnetic and thermal response of the structure. Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime."

The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|γ_{\\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes."

    "abstract": "Facial Image inpainting aim is to restore the missing or corrupted regions in face images while preserving identity, structural consistency and photorealistic image quality, a task specifically created for photo restoration. Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. It produces visually striking results with better semantic preservation, in challenging large-area inpainting situations."

This was then utilized to design efficient \\textit{sensing subspace codes} that estimate the DoA with good resolution. Specifically, the Bose-Chowla sensing subspace code provides near optimal code design for unique DoA estimation with tight theoretical upper bound on the error performance. However, the currently known decoder for these codes, to estimate the DoA, is a traditional \\textit{Maximum-a-Posterior (MAP) decoder} with complexity that is cubic with the number of antennas. In this work, we propose novel efficient decoding algorithms for sensing subspace codes, that reduce the complexity down to quadratic while providing new knobs to tune in order to tradeoff complexity with error performance. The decoders are further evaluated for their performance via Monte Carlo simulations for a range of SNRs demonstrating promising performance that smoothly approaches the MAP performance as the complexity grows from quadratic to cubic in the number of antennas."

Our approach imposes no restrictions on the magnitude of the risk aversion parameter, extending beyond previous work that requires sufficiently small risk aversion. We employ a weak conditioning methodology to construct a Schrödinger bridge between the insider's signal and the asset price process, an approach that naturally accommodates stochastic signal evolution and removes risk aversion constraints. We derive necessary conditions for equilibrium, showing that the optimal insider strategy must be continuous with bounded variation. Under these conditions, we characterize the market-maker pricing rule and insider strategy that achieve equilibrium. We obtain explicit closed-form solutions for important cases including deterministic and quadratic signal volatilities, demonstrating the tractability of our framework."

Two complementary measures were used to characterize these dynamics: the coefficient of variation (CV), a classical indicator of spike-time variability, and statistical complexity, an information-theoretic quantifier of organizational structure. To probe stimulus-dependent activity, we segmented and concatenated recordings from behavioral experiments into distinct time series corresponding to natural image presentations, blank screens during visual task, and spontaneous activity. While the CV failed to discriminate between these conditions, statistical complexity revealed clear, stimulus-specific motifs in population activity. These results indicate that information-theoretic measures can uncover structured, stimulus-dependent patterns in neural population dynamics that remain unobserved in traditional variability metrics."

This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties. In particular, the intrinsic linewidth is substantially reduced, the full linewidth is also decreased (depending on the integration timescale), and the relative intensity noise is slightly reduced. These characteristics, which hold within the whole tuning range, make the EC-QCL a good candidate for spectroscopy applications where broad tunability and narrow linewidth are highly demanded."

In this paper we investigate the trade-off between minimum degree and edge density in the critical window around the chromatic threshold. For a fixed graph $H$ with $χ(H)=r$, allowing a constant deficit below $δ_χ(H)$, we prove sharp (up to lower-order terms) upper bounds on the edge density of $n$-vertex $H$-free graphs whose chromatic number diverges. Equivalently, within this degree regime we show that a suitable global bound on the number of edges forces the chromatic number to remain bounded. Our results thus quantify how global edge density can compensate for a deficit in the local minimum-degree condition near $δ_χ(H)$; more specifically, we obtain explicit bounds in two of the three possible cases arising in the trichotomy of $δ_χ(H)$. Our extremal constructions -- based on Erdős graphs and blowups of Borsuk--Hajnal graphs -- show that these bounds are best possible up to $o(n^2)$ terms."

In this paper, we propose a novel tangential reformulation of the ADI iteration that allows for the efficient construction of low-rank approximations to the solution of Lyapunov equations with indefinite right-hand sides even in the case of constant terms with higher ranks. We provide adaptive methods for the selection of the corresponding ADI parameters, namely shifts and tangential directions, which allow for the automatic application of the method to any relevant problem setting. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is illustrated by several numerical examples."

    "abstract": "We show that stationary black holes and the evolving universe belong to fundamentally different thermodynamic regimes: black holes obey ordinary Bekenstein Hawking thermodynamics, whereas cosmology necessarily follows memory-bearing teleodynamics. We show that teleodynamics is not valid for black holes, but is unavoidable in an expanding cosmology. This provides a dynamical, semi-classical realization of the thermodynamic split conjecture and identifies memory accumulation as the natural source of deviations from the area law in cosmology. Our results suggest that quantum gravity should not seek to extrapolate black hole thermodynamics to the universe, but instead must incorporate horizon memory as a fundamental microscopic ingredient and consider cosmological constructions consistent with that."

    "abstract": "A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\\sim 100~\\rm μm$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications."

Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy, we uncover chemical and kinematic connections between the nebula surrounding its Central Compact Object (CXOU J085201.4-461753) and the nearby Herbig-Haro outflow of Ve 7-27 (Wray 16-30), indicating a shared nitrogen-rich, Fe-peak-enhanced environment. This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\\pm0.7)\\times10^3$ to $(5.6\\pm1.5)\\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor -- consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution."

Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for multi-step agents. CARL achieves focused training through providing action-level optimization signals for high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency during training and inference across diverse evaluation settings."

However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST."

This review synthesizes the evolving understanding of AD pathogenesis, moving beyond the linear amyloid cascade hypothesis to conceptualize the disease as a cross-talk of intricately interacting pathologies, encompassing A$β$, tau, and neuroinflammation as the foundation of phase-adapted pathological network model. This evolving pathophysiological understanding parallels a transformation in diagnostic paradigms, where biomarker-based strategies such as the AT(N) framework enable early disease detection during preclinical or prodromal stages. Within this new landscape, while anti-A$β$ monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, donanemab), represent a breakthrough as the first disease-modifying therapies, their modest efficacy underscores the limitation of single-target approaches. Therefore, I explore the compelling rationale for combination therapies that simultaneously target A$β$ pathology, aberrant tau, and neuroinflammation. Looking forward, I emphasize emerging technological platforms such as gene editing and biophysical neuromodulation in advancing precision medicine. Ultimately, the integration of early biomarker detection, multi-target therapeutic strategies, and AI-driven patient stratification charts a promising roadmap toward fundamentally altering the trajectory of AD. The future of AD management will be defined by preemptive, biomarker-guided, and personalized combination interventions.

Classical strong convergence rate results typically rely on source conditions, which are essential for estimating the truncation error. However, in the framework of kernel approximation, the truncation error in the case of Tikhonov regularization can be characterized entirely through sampling inequalities, without invoking source conditions. In this paper, we first generalize sampling inequalities to spectral regularization, and then, by exploiting the connection between inverse problems and kernel approximation, we derive weak convergence rate bounds for inverse problems, independently of source conditions. These weak convergence rates are established and analyzed when the forward operator is compact and uniformly bounded, or the kernel operator is of trace class."

Extending a well-known distributed optimization strategy called diffusion adaptation to Riemannian manifolds, we show that the resulting algorithm, the Riemannian diffusion adaptation, provably exhibits several desirable behaviors when minimizing a sum of geodesically smooth non-convex functions over manifolds of bounded curvature. More specifically, we establish that the algorithm can approximately achieve network agreement in the sense that Fréchet variance of the iterates among the agents is small. Moreover, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a first-order stationary point for general geodesically non-convex cost functions. When the global cost function additionally satisfies the Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, we also show that it converges linearly under a constant step size up to a steady-state error. Finally, we apply this algorithm to a decentralized robust principal component analysis (PCA) problem formulated on the Grassmann manifold and illustrate its convergence and performance through numerical simulations."

This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results."

Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have become integral to critical applications ranging from autonomous decision-making to automated document processing. As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism."

Traditional EMI mitigation approaches include external shields, subject grounding via electrodes, or active noise cancellation requiring synchronized receive channels. These methods either limit portability, introduce patient discomfort, or demand expensive hardware. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that EMI primarily couples capacitively from the body to the RF coil. We investigated two methods of blocking capacitive coupling while preserving inductive MRI signal detection: First, we employed capacitive segmentation of the RF coil and studied its effect on EMI coupling. Second, we present FENCE (Flexible Electromagnetic Noise Cancellation Endo-shield), a novel approach blocking capacitive coupling using flexible PCB shields placed inside the RF coil. FENCE can be retrofitted to existing RF coils. Finite element (FE) simulations were used to estimate the expected shielding performance and the impact on RF coil losses prior to practical implementation. Testing in various realistic scenarios then demonstrated that the combination of FENCE with segmented coils is effective against both environmental noise sources and controlled EMI. In phantom experiments, FENCE increased SNR by up to a factor of 9 and reduced EMI levels to near-baseline levels with 9% reduction in coil quality factor (Q factor), showing good agreement with the predictions from the FE simulations. In-vivo head imaging confirmed these results across diverse electromagnetic environments where SNR increased by up to a factor 2 while showing an 18% decrease in Q factor. FENCE's simple design provides a low-cost solution to EMI in low-field MRI, enhancing image quality while maintaining system portability and accessibility."

Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure.

Analog neutron-photon coupled simulations are carried out to compare the model's vacuum vessel and blanket components across codes. In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference. On an HPC cluster, Serpent was found to have shorter computation time than OpenMC in neutron photon coupled simulations using both hybrid tracking and delta tracking, but longer in neutron only simulations. An exemplary radioisotope production case is presented for the demonstration of additional VNS capabilities."

However, its known analytical intractability presents persistent channel characterization and performance analysis challenges. This paper introduces two effective and mathematically tractable surrogate models for the Lognormal distribution, constructed from the product of Nakagami-$m$ and Inverse Nakagami-$m$ (I-Nakagami-$m$) variates. These models yield asymptotically exact closed-form expressions for key performance metrics -- including the characteristic function, bit error rate, and Shannon's capacity -- and enable analytically tractable expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function of the composite $α$-$μ$-Lognormal fading model. To facilitate implementation, a moment-matching framework is developed to map the Lognormal parameters to the surrogate model parameters. In addition, a random mixture approach is proposed to enhance convergence by exploiting the complementary approximation properties of the Nakagami-$m$ and I-Nakagami-$m$ distributions. The methodology is further extended to heterogeneous cascaded fading channels comprising arbitrary combinations of $α$-$μ$, $κ$-$μ$, and $η$-$μ$ variates, for which moment-based mappings to the equivalent Lognormal distributions are derived. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach, positioning it as a practical and reliable alternative to exact Lognormal statistics."

    "abstract": "Score matching estimators have garnered significant attention in recent years because they eliminate the need to compute normalizing constants, thereby mitigating the computational challenges associated with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).While several studies have proposed score matching estimators for point processes, this work highlights the limitations of these existing methods, which stem primarily from the lack of a mathematically rigorous analysis of how score matching behaves on finite point processes -- special random configurations on bounded spaces where many of the usual assumptions and properties of score matching no longer hold. To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency."

We investigate the convergence of certain patterned random matrices whose entries are independent CTRWs of various types. In a non-commutative probability framework, we use these high dimensional matrices to derive approximations of the free Brownian motion. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze a random time-changed version of the free Brownian motion driven by an inverse stable subordinator. An approximation of this process is obtained using a random matrix whose entries consist of continuous-time randomly stopped random walks. Moreover, it is shown that the empirical spectral distributions of such matrices have longer tails. Additionally, in a specific case, we use the explicit eigenvalue expressions of these matrices to obtain weak approximations of the standard Brownian motion and a time-changed variant of it."

    "abstract": "Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) input generation is a critical task in software security and supports downstream applications such as path generation and validation. Generating a PoV input requires solving two sets of constraints: (1) reachability constraints for reaching vulnerable code locations, and (2) triggering constraints for activating the target vulnerability. Existing approaches, including directed greybox fuzzing and LLM-assisted fuzzing, struggle to efficiently satisfy these constraints. This work presents an agentic method that mimics human experts. Human analysts iteratively study code to extract semantic reachability and triggering constraints, form hypotheses about PoV triggering strategies, encode them as test inputs, and refine their understanding using debugging feedback. We automate this process with an agentic directed fuzzing framework called PBFuzz. PBFuzz tackles four challenges in agentic PoV generation: autonomous code reasoning for semantic constraint extraction, custom program-analysis tools for targeted inference, persistent memory to avoid hypothesis drift, and property-based testing for efficient constraint solving while preserving input structure. Experiments on the Magma benchmark show strong results. PBFuzz triggered 57 vulnerabilities, surpassing all baselines, and uniquely triggered 17 vulnerabilities not exposed by existing fuzzers. PBFuzz achieved this within a 30-minute budget per target, while conventional approaches use 24 hours. Median time-to-exposure was 339 seconds for PBFuzz versus 8680 seconds for AFL++ with CmpLog, giving a 25.6x efficiency improvement with an API cost of 1.83 USD per vulnerability."

We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks. The full pipeline processes an image in seconds, plugs seamlessly into existing VLM workflows, and constitutes the first practical tool for fine-grained, explainable malicious-image moderation."

We underpin DTC stability with a normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive. These findings establish a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors."

SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment. Furthermore, in online black-box optimization, SQDF attains high sample efficiency while maintaining naturalness and diversity."

If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW."

    "abstract": "Adjusting the outdated knowledge of large language models (LLMs) after deployment remains a major challenge. This difficulty has spurred the development of knowledge editing, which seeks to accurately and efficiently modify a model's internal (parametric) knowledge without retraining it from scratch. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations. First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoEdit substantially outperforms existing knowledge editing methods on the proposed LF-Edit task."

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, enabling effective retrieval while mitigating domain discrepancies. However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets."

    "abstract": "While fulfilling communication tasks, wireless signals can also be used to sense the environment. Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions."

We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length.

In this work, we present SPLICE, a novel part-level neural implicit representation of 3D shapes that enables intuitive, structure-aware, and high-fidelity shape editing. By encoding each shape part independently and positioning them using parameterized Gaussian ellipsoids, SPLICE effectively isolates part-specific features while discarding global context that may hinder flexible manipulation. A global attention-based decoder is then employed to integrate parts coherently, further enhanced by an attention-guiding filtering mechanism that prevents information leakage across symmetric or adjacent components. Through this architecture, SPLICE supports various part-level editing operations, including translation, rotation, scaling, deletion, duplication, and cross-shape part mixing. These operations enable users to flexibly explore design variations while preserving semantic consistency and maintaining structural plausibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPLICE outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively across a diverse set of shape-editing tasks."

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning."

    "abstract": "We unite the dual quarkyonic model with the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model to construct a novel nuclear model based on the quark degrees of freedom, which can cover a wide range of nuclear density from low density to the crossover region. In the model, the relativistic, gaussian quark wavefunction is used to describe the nucleon structure. We first evaluate the energy density, chemical potential, pressure and sound velocity within the ideal Fermi gas picture. In this case, those physical quantities are discontinuous or divergent at the quark saturation density, where quarkyonic phase emerges. To remove such singular behavior, we next introduce an infrared regulator, and combine the dual quarkyonic model and the QMC model to include the nuclear interaction -- we call it the quarkyonic quark-meson coupling (QQMC) model. We then find that the quark saturation density depends strongly on the nucleon size. For example, when $r_p = 0.6\\, (0.8)$ fm, where $r_p$ is the root-mean-square radius of proton, the quark saturation density is about $3.6\\,(1.5) \\times ρ_0$ in symmetric nuclear matter, where $ρ_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. It is notable that the nuclear interaction is quite important to consider physical quantities quantitatively. In fact, the QQMC model can produce the sound velocity which is consistent with that inferred from the observed data of several neutron stars. Furthermore, pressure in symmetric or pure neutron matter deduced from the experiments of heavy-ion collisions at high energy can be explained by the QQMC model as well. We discuss in detail the formulation for the QQMC model and the physical quantities calculated by the model."

The results show that the forward-scattering holographic (FSH), backward-scattering holographic (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) structures are found to be highly sensitive to the pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope in the sub-cycle regime. Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times. These results demonstrate that sub-cycle pulses enable precise temporal control of holographic interference, offering new opportunities for probing and manipulating attosecond electron dynamics."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the Nemosine Framework, a modular cognitive architecture designed to support assisted reasoning, structured thinking, and systematic analysis. The model operates through functional cognitive modules (\"personas\") that organize tasks such as planning, evaluation, cross-checking, and narrative synthesis. The framework combines principles from metacognition, distributed cognition, and modular cognitive systems to offer an operational structure for assisted problem-solving and decision support. The architecture is documented through formal specification, internal consistency criteria, and reproducible structural components. The goal is to provide a clear conceptual basis for future computational implementations and to contribute to the study of symbolic-modular architectures for reasoning."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a widely utilized and successful methodology in human motion synthesis. Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets. Our results also demonstrate the impacts of distinct configurations on model training and suggest the importance and effectiveness of these decisions on the outcomes of motion diffusion models."

Although exact counterdiabatic driving offers excellent performance, it comes at an unscalable computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate that counterdiabatic driving can be significantly improved by restricting the analysis to a relevant subspace of the system. We first show that both direct diagonalization and the Krylov method for obtaining the counterdiabatic matrix can be accelerated through the use of subspace techniques, while still maintaining strong performance. We then demonstrate that the cost function used in the standard Krylov method can be further optimized by employing a subspace-based cost function. These findings open up new possibilities for applying counterdiabatic driving in a practical and efficient manner to a variety of quantum systems."

Three of the AIMs must be built inside AI systems and three in society to address major areas of AI risks: 1) align AI values with human users; 2) constrain AI decision-actions by societal ethics, laws, and regulations; 3) build in human intervention options for emergencies and shut-off switches for existential threats; 4) limit AI access to resources to reinforce controls inside AI; 5) mitigate spillover risks like job loss from AI. We also highlight the differences in AI governance on physical AI systems versus generative AI. We discuss how to strengthen analog physical safeguards to prevent smarter AI/AGI/ASI from circumventing core safety controls by exploiting AI's intrinsic disconnect from the analog physical world: AI's nature as pure software code run on chips controlled by humans, and the prerequisite that all AI-driven physical actions must be digitized. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for AI governance and legislation as the basic structure of a \"brake system\" for AI decisions. If enacted, these controls can rein in AI dangers as completely as humanly possible, removing large chunks of currently wide-open AI risks, substantially reducing overall AI risks to residual human errors."

The total rotation angle $Δ$ of Disc B after one cycle is decomposed into a dynamical phase $Δ_d$ and a geometric phase $Δ_g$. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that this geometric phase can be essentially described as the $U(1)$ holonomy of the Hopf fibration with the canonical connection. By using a Gauss map to represent the disc's motion as a curve on a two-sphere ($S^2$), the work connects the physical rotation to the underlying geometry of the Hopf fiber bundle $S^3 \\to S^2$ and clarifies the origin of the geometric phase."

In contrast, when all extensive variables are allowed to fluctuate (for example, in a grand-canonical ensemble or with pressure fixed), the Ruppeiner geometry can appear flat. We also demonstrate that the thermodynamic geometric metric has a one-to-one correspondence with the periodicity of the Euclidean path integral method. In particular, the inverse temperature (the Euclidean time period) serves as a bridge connecting the thermodynamic geometry and the Euclidean action approach."

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop."

    "abstract": "Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are designed for wave sources in the millihertz band with different locations and orientations. Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise. The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities. Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination. The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity. This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source. As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice. We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles. Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations. By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $φ_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized. The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs."

    "abstract": "One of the primary objectives of satellite remote sensing is to capture the complex dynamics of the Earth environment, which encompasses tasks such as reconstructing continuous cloud-free time series images, detecting land cover changes, and forecasting future surface evolution. However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations."

    "abstract": "Geophysical methods provide a cost-effective way to characterize the subsurface for hydrogeological projects, but they rely on solving an inverse problem. Traditionally, deterministic approaches are used, which face challenges due to non-uniqueness. Stochastic methods offer uncertainty quantification but demand high computational resources. Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) bypasses full stochastic inversion by approximating the posterior distribution at lower cost. However, as with Monte Carlo techniques, efficiency depends on the number of inversion parameters. We show that incorporating prior knowledge into parameterization reduces unknowns and computational burden. Using time-domain electromagnetic data, we identify fresh - saltwater interfaces in the Flemish coastal aquifer. Conventional blocky or smooth deterministic inversions often misrepresent this transition zone as too sharp or too gradual. To address this, we parameterize the zone with two variables - depth and thickness - assuming a linear transition. This retains the compactness of parametric inversion while allowing sharp or gradual interfaces like voxel-based methods. To assess reliability, we invert these parameters stochastically using BEL with Thresholding (BEL1D-T). Results indicate this approach effectively captures uncertainty for synthetic and field data. The transition zone remains uncertain due to survey design and inherent non-uniqueness, yet our probabilistic method achieves this without the heavy computational cost of traditional stochastic approaches."

This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector."

To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines."

Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience.

FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos."

    "abstract": "We present FoundAtion-model-guided decoupled LoCO-maNipulation visuomotor policies (FALCON), a framework for loco-manipulation that combines modular diffusion policies with a vision-language foundation model as the coordinator. Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions. We evaluate FALCON on two challenging loco-manipulation tasks requiring navigation, precise end-effector placement, and tight base-arm coordination. Results show that it surpasses centralized and decentralized baselines while exhibiting improved robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios."

    "abstract": "A classical result of Carleman, based on the theory of quasianalytic functions, shows that polynomials are dense in $L^2(μ)$ for any $μ$ such that the moments $\\int x^k dμ$ do not grow too rapidly as $k \\to \\infty$. In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-Ω,Ω]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications."

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems."

    "abstract": "Nitrogen, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, exists as a diatomic gas under standard temperature and pressure. In the two-dimensional (2D) limit, atomically thin nitrogen, termed nitrogene, has been theoretically predicted to form crystalline materials with various polymorphic configurations, exhibiting diverse chemical and physical properties. However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice. Notably, our calculations predict a nitrogene band gap of up to 7.5 eV, positioning it as a promising candidate for ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and high-k dielectric applications."

The algorithm is similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. The difference in our case is that the goal is not retrieval of the phase of the diffraction signal but the missing data at low momentum transfer, which is necessary for generating the real-space pair distribution function. The missing data is a common problem in static and ultrafast gas phase electron diffraction experiments due to experimental constraints. We demonstrated successful restoration of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured diffraction signals of static and photo-dissociated trifluoroiodomethane and iodobenzene molecules."

Large language models (LLMs) provide strong contextual reasoning, yet prior work mainly uses them as auxiliary modules to refine embeddings or adjust cluster boundaries. We propose ClusterFusion, a hybrid framework that instead treats the LLM as the clustering core, guided by lightweight embedding methods. The framework proceeds in three stages: embedding-guided subset partition, LLM-driven topic summarization, and LLM-based topic assignment. This design enables direct incorporation of domain knowledge and user preferences, fully leveraging the contextual adaptability of LLMs. Experiments on three public benchmarks and two new domain-specific datasets demonstrate that ClusterFusion not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks but also delivers substantial gains in specialized domains. To support future work, we release our newly constructed dataset and results on all benchmarks."

Using twelve authentic advising questions intentionally designed to stress lexical precision, we compared ten personalized and non-personalized system configurations and analyzed outcomes with a Linear Mixed-Effects Model across lexical (BLEU, ROUGE-L), semantic (METEOR, BERTScore), and grounding (RAGAS) metrics. Results showed a consistent trade-off: personalization reliably improved reasoning quality and grounding, yet introduced a significant negative interaction on semantic similarity, driven not by poorer answers but by the limits of current metrics, which penalize meaningful personalized deviations from generic reference texts. This reveals a structural flaw in prevailing LLM evaluation methods, which are ill-suited for assessing user-specific responses. The fully integrated personalized configuration produced the highest overall gains, suggesting that personalization can enhance system effectiveness when evaluated with appropriate multidimensional metrics. Overall, the study demonstrates that personalization produces metric-dependent shifts rather than uniform improvements and provides a methodological foundation for more transparent and robust personalization in agentic AI."

For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight."

We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files. We further test prompt-based mitigation and find only limited reductions, suggesting that it is difficult to eliminate and highlighting the need for stronger mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of LLM-based agents."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient solutions of spatio-temporal partial differential equations (PDEs), such as phase-field models, are fundamental for understanding interfacial dynamics and microstructural evolution in materials science and fluid mechanics. Neural Operators (NOs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven alternatives to traditional solvers; however, existing architectures often accumulate temporal errors, struggle to generalize in long-horizon simulations, and require large training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose PENCO (Physics-Energy-Numerical-Consistent Operator), a hybrid operator-learning framework that integrates physical laws and numerical structure within a data-driven architecture. The formulation introduces an enhanced L^2 Gauss-Lobatto collocation residual around the temporal midpoint that robustly enforces the governing dynamics and significantly improves accuracy, a Fourier-space numerical consistency term that captures the balanced behavior of semi-implicit discretizations, and an energy-dissipation constraint that ensures thermodynamic consistency. Additional low-frequency spectral anchoring and teacher-consistency mechanisms further stabilize learning and suppress long-term error growth. This hybrid design enables PENCO to preserve governing physics while mitigating long-term error growth. Through extensive three-dimensional phase-field benchmarks covering phase ordering, crystallization, epitaxial growth, and complex pattern formation, PENCO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural operators, including Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-4D), while maintaining physically consistent evolution.

However, existing AR image generation suffers from severe memory bottlenecks due to the need to cache all previously generated visual tokens during decoding, leading to both high storage requirements and low throughput. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B."

Our alignment strategy combines a representation-level contrastive objective with a self-supervised modeling, ensuring that the model learns clinical semantics while preserving fine-grained temporal cues. AcuLa achieves state-of-the-art results across 18 diverse cardio-respiratory tasks from 10 different datasets, improving the mean AUROC on classification benchmarks from 0.68 to 0.79 and, on the most challenging COVID-19 cough detection task, boosting the AUROC from 0.55 to 0.89.

We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem."

These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission.

We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties. The full decoupling of sky emission model and instrument response makes the method applicable to a wide variety of instruments or wavelength bands."

These can be captured by adding corrective terms to the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations."

In this work we provide conditions ensuring that every function in $C^{\\infty}_{W,V}(\\mathbb{T})$, which may be highly discontinuous, admits a series expansion that generalizes the classical Taylor expansion. A central feature of our approach is that all proofs are nonstandard, since classical analytical and spectral arguments cannot be adapted to this singular setting. Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $Δ_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\\infty}_{W,V}(\\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability. As a final application we establish existence results for generalized fractional stochastic and deterministic differential equations, as well as for parabolic stochastic partial differential equations acting on nuclear spaces."

    "abstract": "An Ag-doped CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4 heterostructure has been designed to achieve rapid Methylene Blue (MB) degradation through a synergistic photo-Fenton mechanism driven by low-power UV illumination. The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation."

    "abstract": "Generative models have achieved remarkable progress with the emergence of flow matching (FM). It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space."

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method."

While Sak's criterion, $σ_* = 2 - η_{\\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+σ}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $σ_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $η$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $σ= 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $σ_* = 2$."

Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120μm \\times 120μm \\times 80μm$ and a diffractive structure size of $1μm^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers. This work paves the way for compact, low-latency optical processors for high-performance demultiplexers and enables scalable, chip-integrated solutions for next-generation fiber optic networks."

Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency.

To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts."

Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation. We argue that this combination offers a blueprint for other languages and communities seeking inclusive and rigorous LLM evaluation practices."

In our protocol, after a prior training phase, drone Alice chooses a trajectory of positions in space and transmits a message to Bob, on the ground, from each position. From the received messages, Bob estimates the channel gain from which a secret key is extracted. The choice of the positions is made to maximize a lower bound on the secret key capacity. Numerical simulations are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

To implement an efficient RSMA scheme for the MU-MIMO system, in this work, we propose a novel robust precoding design, which can handle imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first adopt the generalized mutual information to construct a lower bound of the objective function in the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we apply a smooth lower bound of the non-smooth sum rate objective function to construct a new optimization problem. By revealing the relationship between the generalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the minimum mean square error matrices, we transform the constructed problem into a tractable one. After decomposing the transformed problem into three subproblems, we investigate a new alternating precoding design based on sequential solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding scheme achieves comparable performance to conventional methods, while significantly reducing the computational complexity."

Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment. Results demonstrate that S2GS significantly improves sim-to-real transferability, maintaining high and stable task performance in real-world scenarios."

Standard regularization methods typically produce solutions in or near the orthogonal complement of the forward operator's null space. This often leads to inadequate results, where internal sources are mistakenly interpreted as being near the data acquisition sites -- e.g., near or at the body surface in connection with EEG and ECG recordings. To mitigate this, we previously proposed weighting schemes for Tikhonov and sparsity regularization. Here, we extend this approach to total variation (TV) regularization, which is particularly suited for identifying spatially extended regions with approximately constant values. We introduce a weighted TV-regularization method, provide supporting analysis, and demonstrate its performance through numerical experiments. Unlike standard TV regularization, the weighted version successfully recovers the location and size of large, piecewise constant sources away from the boundary, though not their exact shape. Additionally, we explore a hybrid weighted-sparsity and TV regularization approach, which better captures both small and large sources, albeit with somewhat more blurred reconstructions than the weighted TV method alone."

Moreover, we demonstrate that the degree of optimality achievable by this mechanism saturates, and that nature appears to operate near saturation. We find that the amount of heat generated by this mechanism constitutes a significant fraction of the total heat produced by living organisms, so that 'life is hot' largely because of the need for a versatile mechanism to optimise a variety of fitness functions."

Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising avenue, but existing contrastive paradigms rely on data augmentations that conflict with the physical semantics of radio signals and require large-batch training, making them poorly suited for CSI. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CIG-MAE -- a Cross-modal Information-Guided Masked Autoencoder -- that reconstructs both the amplitude and phase of CSI using a symmetric dual-stream architecture with a high masking ratio. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Information-Guided Masking strategy that dynamically allocates attention to time-frequency regions with high information density to improve learning efficiency, and incorporate a Barlow Twins regularizer to align cross-modal representations without negative samples.

A bubble implosion combines micro-bubbles and ultraintense laser pulses of 10^20-10^22W/cm^2 to generate ultrahigh fields and relativistic protons. The bubble wall protons undergo volumetric acceleration toward the centre due to the spherically symmetric Coulomb force and the innermost protons accumulate at the centre with a density comparable to the interior of a white dwarf. Then an unprecedentedly high electric field is formed, which produces an energetic proton flash. Three-dimensional particle simulations confirm the robustness of Coulomb-imploded bubbles, which behave as nano-pulsars with repeated implosions and explosions to emit protons.

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment."

    "abstract": "Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) and Regularisation by Denoising (RED) have established that image denoisers can effectively replace traditional regularisers in linear inverse problem solvers for tasks like super-resolution, demosaicing, and inpainting. It is now well established in the literature that a denoiser's residual links to the gradient of the image log prior (Miyasawa and Tweedie), enabling iterative, gradient ascent-based image generation (e.g., diffusion models), as well as new methods for solving inverse problems. Building on this, we propose enhancing Kadkhodaie and Simoncelli's gradient-based inverse solvers by fine-tuning the denoiser within the iterative solving process itself. Training the denoiser end-to-end across the solver framework and simultaneously across multiple tasks yields a single, versatile denoiser optimised for inverse problems. We demonstrate that even a simple baseline model fine-tuned this way achieves an average PSNR improvement of +1.34 dB across six diverse inverse problems while reducing the required iterations. Furthermore, we analyse the fine-tuned denoiser's properties, finding that its optimisation objective implicitly shifts from minimising standard denoising error (MMSE) towards approximating an ideal prior gradient specifically tailored for guiding inverse recovery."

Due to the intrinsic non-associative nature of octonions, conventional linear operator theory encounters profound structural difficulties. We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms. We obtain a rigorous characterization of self-adjointness which indicates how to introduce a new notion of strong eigenvalues. For every compact, para-linear, self-adjoint operator with strong eigenvalues, we can establish the spectral decomposition theorem and functional calculi."

    "abstract": "In mathematical phylogenetics, evolutionary relationships are often represented by trees and networks. The latter are typically used whenever the relationships cannot be adequately described by a tree, which happens when so-called reticulate evolutionary events happen, such as horizontal gene transfer or hybridization. But as such events are known to be relatively rare for most species, evolution is sometimes thought of as a process that can be represented by a tree with some additional edges, i.e., with a network that is still ``somewhat treelike''. In this context, different versions of so-called tree-based networks have played a major role in recent phylogenetic literature. Yet, surprisingly little is known about their combinatorial and graph-theoretic properties. In our manuscript, we answer a recently published question concerning the colorability of a specific class of tree-based networks. In particular, we will investigate an even more general class of graphs and show their 3-colorability. This nicely links recent phylogenetic concepts with classical graph theory."

We identify three key research challenges: (i) developing comprehensive evaluation frameworks to assess ethical behavior at individual, interactional, and systemic levels; (ii) elucidating the internal mechanisms that give rise to emergent behaviors through mechanistic interpretability; and (iii) implementing targeted parameter-efficient alignment techniques to steer MALMs towards ethical behaviors without compromising their performance."

The design leverages the strengths of both linear and non-linear model structures, allowing it to capture all relevant stylised price characteristics in power markets, including calendar and autoregressive effects, as well as influences from load, renewable energy, and related fuel and carbon markets. For empirical testing, we use hourly data from the largest European electricity market spanning 2018 to 2025 in a comprehensive forecasting study, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, particularly high-dimensional linear and neural network models.

So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of \"perceive\", \"reason\", and \"correspond\". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction.

Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence.

    "abstract": "Efficient streaming video generation is critical for simulating interactive and dynamic worlds. Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU."

    "abstract": "It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive. Since all ADI methods implicitly perform model order reduction when solving these linear matrix equations, we show that the resulting reduced-order models can be obtained as an additional byproduct. These models not only interpolate the original transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts but also preserve important system properties such as stability, minimum-phase property, positive-realness, bounded-realness, and passivity. Consequently, the proposed unified ADI framework also serves as a recursive, interpolation-based model order reduction method, which can preserve several important properties of the original model in the reduced-order model."

However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources."

These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states."

In this work, we vary the physical thickness of the GBL and TDL, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the energy bands of the gate structure to investigate the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS structure. The physical origin of the RL is that the electric field direction across the TDL reduces the potential barrier provided by the ferroelectric near the silicon substrate. Based on the above physical mechanism, the RL can be reduced to 12% and 0.2% by redesigning the gate structure or reducing the pulse amplitude, respectively. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS gate structure. It provides guidance for enhancing the reliability of FeFETs."

    "abstract": "Earth observation (EO) models are frequently trained under implicit sampling policies that optimize global accuracy but provide no explicit guarantees on who (which regions, classes, or mission-critical strata) is being served throughout training. This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement."

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step.

We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement. Our code is publicly available on github."

    "abstract": "Introduction: Raoellidae are small artiodactyls retrieved from the middle Eocene of Asia (ca. -47 Ma) and closely related to stem Cetacea. Morphological observations of their endocranial structures allow for outlining some of the early steps of the evolutionary history of the cetacean brain. The external features of the brain and associated sinuses of Raoellidae are so far only documented by the virtual reconstruction of the endocast based on specimens of the species Indohyus indirae. These specimens are however too deformed to fully access the external morphology, surface area, and volume measurements of the brain. Methods: We bring here new elements to the picture of the raoellid brain by an investigation of the internal structures of an exceptionally well-preserved cranium collected from the Kalakot area (Jammu and Kashmir, India) referred to the species Khirtharia inflata. Micro-CT scan investigation and virtual reconstruction of the endocast and associated sinuses of this specimen provide crucial additional data about the morphological diversity within Raoellidae as well as reliable linear, surfaces, and volumes measurements, allowing for quantitative studies. Results: We show that, like I. indirae, the brain of K. inflata exhibits a mosaic of features observed in earliest artiodactyls: a small neocortex with simple folding pattern, widely exposed midbrain, and relatively long cerebellum. But, like Indohyus, the brain of Khirtharia shows unique derived characters also observed in stem cetaceans: narrow elongated olfactory bulbs and peduncles, posterior location of the braincase in the cranium, and complex network of blood vessels around the cerebellum. The volume of the brain relative to body mass of K. inflata is markedly small when compared to other early artiodactyls. Conclusion: We show here that cetaceans that nowadays have the second biggest brain after humans derive from a group of animals that had a lower-than-average expected brain size. This is probably a side effect of the adaptation to aquatic life. Conversely, this very small brain size relative to body mass might be another line of evidence supporting the aquatic habits in raoellids."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy requires greater use of storage resources to manage system intermittency. As a result, there is growing interest in evaluating the opportunity cost of stored energy, or usage values, which can be derived by solving a multistage stochastic optimization problem. Stochasticity arises from net demand (the aggregation of demand and non-dispatchable generation), the availability of dispatchable generation, and inflows when the storage facilities considered are hydroelectric dams. We aim to compute these usage values for each market zone of the interconnected European electricity system, in the context of prospective studies currently conducted by RTE, the French TSO. The energy system is mathematically modelled as a directed graph, where nodes represent market zones and arcs represent interconnection links. In large energy systems, spatial complexity (thirty nodes in the system, each with at most one aggregated storage unit) compounds temporal complexity (a one-year horizon modelled with two timescales: weekly subproblems with hourly time steps). This work addresses three main sources of complexity: temporal, spatial, and stochastic. We tackle the multinode multistage stochastic optimisation problem by incorporating a spatio-temporal decomposition scheme. To efficiently compute usage values, we apply Dual Approximate Dynamic Programming (DADP), which enables tractable decomposition across both time and space. This approach yields nodal usage values that depend solely on the local state of each node, independently of the others. We conduct numerical studies on a realistic system composed of thirty nodes (modelling part of Europe) and show that DADP obtains competitive results when comparing with traditional methods like Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP)."

    "abstract": "Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity. We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping."

Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations.

    "abstract": "We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei."

In this work, we examine the implications of the SNEC conjecture for Genesis models, typically constructed within generalized Galileon theories.

    "abstract": "The growing scale, complexity, interconnectivity, and autonomy of modern software ecosystems introduce unprecedented uncertainty, challenging the foundations of traditional self-adaptation. Existing approaches, typically rule-driven controllers or isolated learning components, struggle to generalize to novel contexts or coordinate responses across distributed subsystems, leaving them ill-equipped for emergent unknown unknowns. Recent discussions on Self-Adaptation 2.0 emphasize an equal partnership between AI and adaptive systems, merging learning-driven intelligence with adaptive control for predictive and proactive behavior. Building on this foundation, we introduce POLARIS, a three-layer multi-agentic self-adaptation framework that advances beyond reactive adaptation. POLARIS integrates: (1) a low-latency Adapter layer for monitoring and safe execution, (2) a transparent Reasoning layer that generates and verifies plans using tool-aware, explainable agents, and (3) a Meta layer that records experiences and meta-learns improved adaptation policies over time. Through shared knowledge and predictive models, POLARIS handles uncertainty, learns from past actions, and evolves its strategies, enabling systems that anticipate change and maintain resilient, goal-directed behavior. Preliminary evaluation on two self-adaptive exemplars, SWIM and SWITCH, shows that POLARIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We argue this marks a shift toward Self-Adaptation 3.0, akin to Software 3.0: a paradigm where systems not only learn from their environment but also reason about and evolve their own adaptation processes, continuously improving to meet novel challenges."

    "abstract": "Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it."

    "abstract": "NORi is a machine-learned (ML) parameterization of ocean boundary layer turbulence that is physics-based and augmented with neural networks. NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training."

    "abstract": "The use of terahertz (THz) communications with massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems in 6G can potentially provide high data rates and low latency communications. However, accurate channel estimation in THz frequencies presents significant challenges due to factors such as high propagation losses, sensitivity to environmental obstructions, and strong atmospheric absorption. These challenges are particularly pronounced in urban environments, where traditional channel estimation methods often fail to deliver reliable results, particularly in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. This paper introduces a novel vision-based channel estimation technique that integrates causal reasoning into urban THz communication systems. The proposed method combines computer vision algorithms with variational causal dynamics (VCD) to analyze real-time images of the urban environment, allowing for a deeper understanding of the physical factors that influence THz signal propagation. By capturing the complex, dynamic interactions between physical objects (such as buildings, trees, and vehicles) and the transmitted signals, the model can predict the channel with up to twice the accuracy of conventional methods. This model improves estimation accuracy and demonstrates superior generalization performance. Hence, it can provide reliable predictions even in previously unseen urban environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is particularly evident in NLoS conditions, where it significantly outperforms traditional methods such as by accounting for indirect signal paths, such as reflections and diffractions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed vision-based approach surpasses conventional artificial intelligence (AI)-based estimation techniques in accuracy and robustness, showing a substantial improvement across various dynamic urban scenarios."

The proposed system, LangSAT, bridges the gap between natural language inputs and propositional logic by converting English descriptions into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) expressions and solving them using an RL-enhanced CDCL SAT solver. Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging."

However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments."

    "abstract": "This work introduces RedEigCD, the first self-adaptive timestepping technique specifically tailored for reduced-order models (ROMs) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations."

Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model. To ensure long-term temporal stability, we introduce a novel reference-guided feedback mechanism that prevents error accumulation. This mechanism also serves as a plug-and-play stylization module, enabling real-time style transfer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that COMET robustly generates high-quality motion at real-time speeds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in complex motion control tasks and confirming its readiness for demanding interactive applications."

In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment.

The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.

In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits. We also highlight additional opportunities, such as AMC-based compressed-sensing recovery for channel estimation and eigenvalue circuits for leakage-based precoding. Finally, we outline key challenges, including RRAM device reliability, analog circuit precision, array scalability, and data conversion bottlenecks, and discuss the opportunities for overcoming these barriers.

From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens. By jointly optimizing data organization and algorithmic design, our method effectively mitigates entropy collapse and enhances LLM reasoning.

Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation.

We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation."

This system serves as a proxy for studying the amphiphilic nature of pheromones and their interactions with aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Our simulations reveal the molecular organization of the bombykol monolayer and its adsorption isotherm. A soft-sticky particle equation of state accurately describes the monolayer's behavior. The analysis uncovers a two-dimensional liquid-gas phase transition within the monolayer. Collective adsorption stabilises the molecules at the interface and the calculated free energy gain is approximately $2\\:k_\\mathrm{B}T$.

    "abstract": "We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models."

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT."

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models."

    "abstract": "All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) tasks often involve diverse degradation that require robust and versatile strategies. However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods."

Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs."

Specifically, we consider a communication scenario where a legitimate transmitter aims to covertly deliver information to its intended receiver through a planar FRIS, while an adversary attempts to detect whether any transmission is occurring. In this context, we analyze the false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities, and derive a closed-form expression for the covertness outage probability (COP). Furthermore, the success probability is characterized under the optimal detection threshold, providing new insights into the trade-off between covertness and reliable transmission. Numerical results reveal that FRIS provides a clear advantage over fixed-position RIS at low-to-moderate transmit powers by improving reliability and enhancing covertness, while at very high power levels, fixed-position RIS may sustain slightly higher success probability due to reduced leakage toward the adversary."

However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector. Our approach can be used to bound the sample complexity for minimizing both the validation loss as well as the number of gradient descent iterations."

We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems."

Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs.

We present a novel, multi-phase optimization approach for automatically generating WCAG-compliant colors while minimizing perceptual change to original design choices. Our method treats this as a constrained, non-linear optimization problem, utilizing the modern perceptually uniform OKLCH color space. Crucially, the optimization is constrained to preserve the original hue ($\\text{H}$) of the color, ensuring that modifications are strictly limited to necessary adjustments in lightness ($\\text{L}$) and chroma ($\\text{C}$). This is achieved through a three-phase sequence: binary search, gradient descent, and progressive constraint relaxation. Evaluation on a dataset of 10,000 procedurally generated color pairs demonstrates that the algorithm successfully resolves accessibility violations in $77.22\\%$ of cases, with $88.51\\%$ of successful corrections exhibiting imperceptible color difference ($ΔE_{2000} < 2.0$) as defined by standard perceptibility thresholds. The median perceptual change for successful adjustments is only $0.76\\ ΔE_{2000}$, and the algorithm achieves this with a median processing time of $0.876\\text{ms}$ per color pair. The approach demonstrates that accessibility compliance and visual design integrity can be achieved simultaneously through a computationally efficient, perceptually-aware optimization that respects brand identity. The algorithm is publicly implemented in the open-source cm-colors Python library."

We study 719 defects that we extract from 2,260 Kubernetes configuration scripts using open source repositories. Using qualitative analysis, we identify 15 categories of defects. We find 8 publicly available static analysis tools to be capable of detecting 8 of the 15 defect categories. We find that the highest precision and recall of those tools are for defects related to data fields. We develop a linter to detect two categories of defects that cause serious consequences, which none of the studied tools are able to detect. Our linter revealed 26 previously-unknown defects that have been confirmed by practitioners, 19 of which have already been fixed. We conclude our paper by providing recommendations on how defect detection and repair techniques can be used for Kubernetes configuration scripts.

    "abstract": "Context. While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime."

Recent work has investigated the theoretical and empirical properties of low-dimensional representations of agents based on query responses at a single time point. This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems. We characterize the empirical properties of our proposed tests, including their sensitivity to key hyperparameters, in simulations motivated by a multi-agent system of evolving digital personas. Finally, we demonstrate via natural experiment that our proposed tests detect changes that correlate sensitively, specifically, and significantly with a real exogenous event. As far as we are aware, TDKPS is the first principled framework for monitoring behavioral dynamics in black-box multi-agent systems -- a critical capability as generative agent deployment continues to scale."

    "abstract": "Understanding the effect of system size on the applicability of the hydrodynamic description in heavy-ion physics remains unclear. Recent measurements of OO collisions at the LHC offer a new opportunity to refine our understanding of collectivity because of their intermediate size relative to heavy-ion and small-system collisions, as well as the relatively good control over their initial state. We use the CoMBolt-ITA hybrid model to describe recent OO measurements at the LHC. The model employs TrENTo for the initial state. A combination of the pre-equilibration and hydrodynamized medium stages is modeled consistently by CoMBolt-ITA, which evolves the Boltzmann distribution of massless collective excitations. The afterburner stage is included by employing UrQMD. Using this approach, we test whether the system lies in the regime where its spatial size approaches the mean free path, corresponding to low opacity, or in the opposite limit, where its size exceeds the mean free path sufficiently to enter the fluid-like evolution regime with high opacity. We find that, in light of the data-model comparison and considering the current status of the model, OO collisions with centralities larger than $60\\%$ gradually leave the domain of fluid-like evolution."

We make use of the van der Pol-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and derive coupled mode equations that describe near-resonant interactions between neighbouring multipoles. We compare two routes to instability, namely the difference-frequency mixing between adjacent modes and the diagonal (Mathieu) self-modulation channel. We show that, at high multipole number (eikonal limit), the difference-frequency route dominates and drives a one-way cascade from higher to lower frequencies. We chart the corresponding instability regions (\"tongues\") and quantify their detuning dependence. The framework provides a simple, quantitative mechanism for energy transfer in black hole ringdowns and clarifies when and how turbulent signatures can arise within linear probes on a weakly perturbed background."

    "abstract": "The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ hosts a fascinating edge case of magnetism: while nonmagnetic in ideal bulk material, density functional theory (DFT) predicts an altermagnetic ground state within the DFT$+U$ method. The magnetic state of strained or doped thin films remains controversial, but evidence for a nontrivial magnetic state is ample. Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states. Comparison of LSDA+U, GGA+U, and meta-GGA+U results on RuO$_2$ shows systematic enhancement of the exchange interaction, leading to a reduction of the onset value of the Hubbard $U$ parameter at different levels of density functional approximation. However, the magnetic ground state, studied at the experimental lattice constants, remains nonmagnetic with r$^2$SCAN-L. I demonstrate that altermagnetism is easily formed upon lattice expansion, hole doping, and uniaxial strain on the c-axis. The r$^2$SCAN-L calculations set conservative thresholds for distortions and doping levels for the onset of altermagnetism in a parameter-free framework."

In this work, we introduce parametric disjunctive timed networks, where each timed automaton may contain timing parameters, i.e. unknown constants. We investigate two problems: deciding the emptiness of the set of parameter valuations for which 1) a given location is reachable for at least one process (local property), and 2) a global state is reachable where all processes are in a given location (global property). Our main positive result is that the first problem is decidable for networks of processes with a single clock and without invariants; this result holds for arbitrarily many timing parameters -- a setting with few known decidability results. However, it becomes undecidable when invariants are allowed, or when considering global properties, even for systems with a single parameter. This highlights the significant expressive power of invariants in these networks. Additionally, we exhibit further decidable subclasses by restraining the syntax of guards and invariants."

In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits. The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field."

This paper bridges this gap by developing a multicarrier stochastic framework that explicitly couples local gradient updates with frequency-selective THz effects, including beam squint, molecular absorption, and jitter. Our analysis uncovers a critical diversity trap: under standard unbiased aggregation, the convergence error floor is driven by the harmonic mean of subcarrier SNRs. Consequently, a single spectral hole caused by severe beam squint can render the entire bandwidth useless for reliable model updates. We further identify a fundamental bandwidth limit, revealing that expanding the spectrum beyond a critical point degrades convergence due to the integration of thermal noise and gain collapse at band edges. Finally, we demonstrate that an SNR-weighted aggregation strategy is necessary to suppress the variance singularity at these spectral holes, effectively recovering convergence in high-squint regimes where standard averaging fails. Numerical results validate the expected impact of the discussed physical layer parameters' on performance of THz-FL systems."

The approach establishes a direct connection between LPWA and Hilbert-space operator theory, including the invariant subspace, providing a formal mathematical interpretation of energy transfer and wakefield formation. Furthermore, the operator formalism integrates with neural operator methods, allowing efficient approximation of $\\hat{N}$ and $\\hatα$ for reduced-order modeling and predictive control.

The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation. The generative model further supports both conditional and unconditional generation.

However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."

Most existing efforts on APA have predominantly concentrated on highly constrained reading-aloud tasks (where learners are prompted to read a reference text aloud); however, assessing pronunciation quality in unscripted speech (or free-speaking scenarios) remains relatively underexplored. In light of this, we first propose HiPPO, a hierarchical pronunciation assessment model tailored for spoken languages, which evaluates an L2 learner's oral proficiency at multiple linguistic levels based solely on the speech uttered by the learner. To improve the overall accuracy of assessment, a contrastive ordinal regularizer and a curriculum learning strategy are introduced for model training. The former aims to generate score-discriminative features by exploiting the ordinal nature of regression targets, while the latter gradually ramps up the training complexity to facilitate the assessment task that takes unscripted speech as input. Experiments conducted on the Speechocean762 benchmark dataset validates the feasibility and superiority of our method in relation to several cutting-edge baselines."

We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training."

We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection."

We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains.

This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data."

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions. Overall, the approach offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling."

    "abstract": "In general, approximating classes of functions defined over high-dimensional input spaces by linear combinations of a fixed set of basis functions or ``features'' is known to be hard. Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $Θ\\(n^{-1/d}\\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes."

Extensive experiments on matrix sizes ranging from 16 to 1024 show that PVLS provides up to a 2.6x speedup in optimization and requires fewer iterations while maintaining comparable solution accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of machine-learning-guided initialization strategies for improving the practicality of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in the NISQ era."

    "abstract": "During the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), thermal pulses lead to the formation of strongly stratified layers in the outer regions of the CO core, which might lead to inversions in the chemical gradient. Such inversions would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion and the standard use of mixing length theory (MLT). We used a set of MLT equations that consider the impact of the background chemical gradients. This extension of MLT is referred to in this work as MLT$\\sharp$, to make a distinction between both prescriptions. We applied MLT$\\sharp$ in tandem with the more general Ledoux instability criterion. We computed the evolution in the AGB phase and compared the chemical profiles resulting from MLT, MLT$\\sharp$ and the double diffusive GNA theory. We continued the evolution through a post-AGB thermal pulse and performed a pulsational analysis of the resultant GW Vir models to asses $g$-mode pulsation periods. Finally, we tested our results with pulsation properties of known GW Vir stars derived from recent observations. We find that the much simpler MLT$\\sharp$ set of equations closely reproduces the results from the GNA theory. As such, MLT$\\sharp$ offers a simple way to include chemically driven convection in stellar evolution computations. Stellar evolution simulations show that Rayleigh-Taylor and thermohaline instabilities can play an important role during the TP-AGB. We obtained significantly different chemical profiles using a standard MLT approach compared to those resulting from our MLT$\\sharp$ and GNA computations. Our adiabatic pulsational analysis shows that these differences in the chemical stratification leave clear mode-trapping signatures in the pulsation spectrum of the GW Vir models."

The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail."

    "abstract": "Extensive research on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) has primarily focused on optimizing reflective coefficients for passive beamforming in specific target directions. This optimization typically assumes prior knowledge of the target direction, which is unavailable before the target is detected. To enhance direction estimation, it is critical to develop array pattern synthesis techniques that yield a wider beam by maximizing the received power over the entire target area. Although this challenge has been addressed with active antennas, RIS systems pose a unique challenge due to their inherent phase constraints, which can be continuous or discrete. This work addresses this challenge through a novel array pattern synthesis method tailored for discrete phase constraints in RIS. We introduce a penalty method that pushes these constraints to the boundary of the convex hull. Then, the Minorization-Maximization (MM) method is utilized to reformulate the problem into a convex one. Our numerical results show that our algorithm can generate a wide beam pattern comparable to that achievable with per-power constraints, with both the amplitudes and phases being adjustable. We compare our method with a traditional beam sweeping technique, showing a) several orders of magnitude reduction of the MSE of Angle of Arrival (AOA) at low to medium Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)s; and b) $8$~dB SNR reduction to achieve a high probability of detection."

While recent promptable detection frameworks have achieved remarkable accuracy in target localization, existing methods typically rely on manual annotations as prompts, which are labor-intensive and impractical for clinical applications. To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures."

    "abstract": "Knowledge-based conversational question answering (KBCQA) confronts persistent challenges in resolving coreference, modeling contextual dependencies, and executing complex logical reasoning. Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning."

This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10MΩ resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications."

    "abstract": "Research on student progression in higher education has traditionally focused on vertical outcomes such as persistence and dropout, often reducing complex academic histories to binary indicators. While the structural component of horizontal mobility (major switching, plan changes, re-entries) has recently been recognised as a core feature of contemporary university systems, the temporal cost and efficiency of these pathways remain largely unquantified. Using forty years of administrative records from a large faculty of engineering and exact sciences in Argentina (N = 24,016), this study applies a dual-outcome survival analysis framework to two key outcomes: definitive dropout and first major switch. We reconstruct academic trajectories as sequences of enrolment spells and typed transitions under the CAPIRE protocol, and then deploy non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimators to model time-to-event under right-censoring. Results uncover a critical systemic inefficiency: a global median survival time of 4.33 years prior to definitive dropout, with a pronounced long tail of extended enrolment. This pattern reveals a phenomenon of stagnant persistence, where students remain formally enrolled for long periods without commensurate curricular progression. In contrast, major switching follows an early-event regime, with a median time of 1.0 year among switchers and most switches concentrated within the first academic year. We argue that academic failure in rigid engineering curricula is not a sudden outcome but a long-tail process that generates high opportunity costs, and that institutional indicators should shift from static retention metrics towards measures of curricular velocity based on time-to-event analysis."

The ESGE current is formed owing to the altermagnetic spin splitting and the scattering of carriers by the edge of the sample. The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge."

In this context, graded identities naturally arise as prominent tools, since ordinary polynomial identities can be viewed as a particular case of graded identities. Moreover, as an involution does not necessarily preserve the homogeneous components of a grading, it is natural to consider the notion of a homogeneous involution. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the codimension sequence in the setting of $G$-graded algebras endowed with a homogeneous involution. More specifically, we characterize the varieties of polynomial growth in terms of the exclusion of a list of algebras from the variety. As a consequence, we provide the classification of the varieties with almost polynomial growth in this setting."

Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials."

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing aims to update specific facts in large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework consistently improves editing reliability and generalization under real-world evaluations, while better preserving locality and pre-trained capabilities."

To address these issues, this study proposes a Nonlinear Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm (NAWOA), which integrates strategies such as Good Nodes Set initialization, Leader-Followers Foraging, Dynamic Encircling Prey, Triangular Hunting, and a nonlinear convergence factor to enhance exploration, exploitation, and convergence stability. Experiments on 23 benchmark functions demonstrate NAWOA's superior optimization capability and robustness. Based on this optimizer, an NAWOA-XGBoost model was developed to predict academic potential using data from 495 Computer Science undergraduates at Macao Polytechnic University (2009-2019). Results show that NAWOA-XGBoost outperforms traditional XGBoost and WOA-XGBoost across key metrics, including Accuracy (0.8148), Macro F1 (0.8101), AUC (0.8932), and G-Mean (0.8172), demonstrating strong adaptability on multi-class imbalanced datasets."

    "abstract": "The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability."

Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases."

The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current."

We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement. Second, we construct ConvoInsight-DB, a new large-scale dataset with expert annotations for micro-expressions and deep psychological inference. Third, Third, we designed the Mental Reasoning Insight Rating Metric (PRISM), an automated dimensional framework that uses expert-guided LLM to measure the multidimensional performance of large mental vision models. On our PRISM benchmark, MIND significantly outperforms all baselines, achieving a +86.95% gain in micro-expression detection over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our Status Judgment disentanglement module is the most critical component for this performance leap. Our code has been opened."

The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology."

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) methods that operate only at fixed scales (e.g., 4x), enabling a single model to handle arbitrary magnification. Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors.

    "abstract": "El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the Earth's strongest source of interannual climate variability. Although its center of action is in the tropical Pacific, it has significant influences on the climate at the planetary scale. ENSO is sustained by a feedback process between equatorial winds, vertical displacements of the thermocline, and sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly gradients. This produces an oscillation in the SST anomaly between a warm (El Niño) and a cold phase (La Niña). While the natural time-scale of ENSO variability is interannual, variations in its behavior and characteristics have been observed over longer time scales, including decadal and interdecadal. Here, we use the Helmholtz decomposition to break down the wind stress into two components: irrotational (curl free) and solenoidal (divergence free). We show that the irrotational component of the wind stress drives the dynamics of the thermocline on the interannual time-scale, while the solenoidal component, whose action is influenced by the stratification of the water column, affects the variability of the thermocline over decadal or interdecadal time-scales. Furthermore, we develop an integral relation that links the variability of the thermocline depth anomaly across the entire tropical Pacific to the variability of the average SST anomaly in the central tropical Pacific (known as the Niño-3.4 index) and conclude that the irrotational component of the wind stress determines the interannual variability of the Niño-3.4 index, while the solenoidal component determines its long-term variability."

    "abstract": "We develop a flexible feature selection framework based on deep neural networks that approximately controls the false discovery rate (FDR), a measure of Type-I error. The method applies to architectures whose first layer is fully connected. From the second layer onward, it accommodates multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) of arbitrary width and depth, convolutional and recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, residual connections, and dropout. The procedure also accommodates stochastic gradient descent with data-independent initializations and learning rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee of FDR control for feature selection within such a general deep learning setting. Our analysis is built upon a multi-index data-generating model and an asymptotic regime in which the feature dimension $n$ diverges faster than the latent dimension $q^{*}$, while the sample size, the number of training iterations, the network depth, and hidden layer widths are left unrestricted. Under this setting, we show that each coordinate of the gradient-based feature-importance vector admits a marginal normal approximation, thereby supporting the validity of asymptotic FDR control. As a theoretical limitation, we assume $\\mathbf{B}$-right orthogonal invariance of the design matrix, and we discuss broader generalizations. We also present numerical experiments that underscore the theoretical findings."

The use of masculine personal nouns to refer to mixed-gender groups or unspecified individuals has been widely debated in academia and the public, with con-flicting perspectives on its gender-neutrality. While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations. These findings provide a solid basis for aligning linguistic stimuli in psy-cholinguistic studies more closely with real-world language use."

However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre. We apply the method to the protobinary system NGC1333 IRAS4A, using ALMA high-spatial resolution ($\\sim$50 au) observations of the OCS(19-18) line as part of the ALMA Large Program FAUST. We also present new quantum mechanics calculations of the OCS binding energy distribution, essential for the application of the method. We found that the two binary components, A1 and A2, have a comparable luminosity within the error bars, 7.5$\\pm$2.5 and 7$\\pm$1 L$_\\odot$, respectively.

We find that, under suitable conditions, the strong Coulomb drag effect induces effects like negative conductivity and joint electron-hole hydrodynamics (bifluidity) in the plasma. We also identify the exclusive electron or hole hydrodynamics. We find that there is a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low doped regimes. Our work elucidates the roles of the microscopic scattering mechanisms that drive these hydrodynamic phenomena."

    "abstract": "Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires an agent to interpret language, perceive its environment, and navigate within 3D scenes to produce responses. Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking based on thermal infrared imaging has been one of the most important sensing technologies in anti-UAV applications. However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed."

    "abstract": "To enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in various domain-specific applications, sensitive data such as healthcare, law, and finance are being used to privately customize or fine-tune these models. Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment. In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments."

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee."

We prove that such a tuple gives rise to a semi-Cartan graph if admitting all reflections. Consequently, its Weyl groupoid is well-defined. We further establish several criteria for the finite-dimensionality of Nichols algebras in terms of the associated semi-Cartan graph. As an application, we provide a new proof for the infinite-dimensionality of a specific class of Nichols algebras previously studied in \\cite{huang2024classification}, bypassing extensive computational arguments."

The location of the surface detector array on the shore of Lake Baikal is motivated by the fact that permanent placement of detectors on the surface of the lake is challenging. Within the given geometry, simultaneous registration is possible for EAS with a zenith angle of about 76 degrees within the limited solid angle. The corresponding inclined EAS are dominated by muons and significantly attenuated. The installation will make it possible to obtain an estimate of the number of high-energy muons in EAS. This, subsequently, would make it possible to verify EAS modeling and calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. The detector may also be used for cross-calibration of energy and direction measurements by the neutrino telescope. We use the CORSIKA program to simulate the registration of EAS on the shore close to the Baikal-GVD. The propagation of ultra-high energy muons produced by EAS through 3.5 km of water and their registration by Baikal-GVD is simulated using the PROPOSAL package. We calculate the minimal total area of the onshore detectors suitable for several cosmic ray energy thresholds, starting from 1 PeV. The report presents estimates of the number of events jointly registered by the onshore installation and the Baikal-GVD the EAS registration detector systems with different areas."

    "abstract": "Viscosity calculation from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relies on the traditional Green-Kubo (GK) framework, which integrates the stress autocorrelation function (SACF) over time. While the formalism is exact in the linear response regime, the traditional approach often suffers from poor convergence and requires extensive phase space sampling, which is computationally demanding for soft matter and polymer systems. In this Letter, we introduce a hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework that alleviates these limitations by partitioning the SACF into two physically meaningful regimes: (i) a short time ballistic component extracted directly from short MD simulations, and (ii) a long time relaxation tail represented using analytically motivated functions, $φ(τ)$, fitted only to short trajectories. This strategy bypasses the need for extensive sampling while preserving physical rigor. Benchmarking against SPC/E water confirms excellent agreement with established results, and we further demonstrate the efficacy of the method for challenging electrolyte systems (EC-LiTFSI and PEO-LiTFSI), for which the GK framework fails to converge. The computational savings are substantial, with reductions of several orders of magnitude in required sampling, achieved without compromising predictive accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of the hGK framework and outline clear avenues for refinement, including optimal tail selection and robust identification of relaxation regimes in noisy stress data. The hGK framework presented in this Letter provides a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient route for viscosity prediction in molecular liquids, polymer melts, and ionically conducting soft materials."

The existing methods not only fail to conclude on the exact classification, but also are severely limited by computational resources and suffer from the numerical precision problem. Here we introduce an operational approach to identify the inequivalence of MUBs subsets, which has less time complexity and entirely avoids the computational precision issues. For arbitrary MUBs subsets of $k$ elements in any prime dimension, this method yields a universal analytical upper bound for the amount of MUBs equivalence classes. By applying this method through simple iterations, we further obtain tighter classification upper bounds for any prime dimension $d\\leq 37$. Crucially, the comparison of these upper bounds with existing lower bounds successfully determines the exact classification for all MUBs subsets in any dimension $d \\leq 17$. We further extend this method to the case that the dimension is a power of prime number. This general and scalable framework for the classification of MUBs subsets sheds new light on related applications."

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to \"robotize\" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly \"overlay\" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million \"robotized\" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness."

Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM."

In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$σ$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe."

Starting from a canonical model of parametrically excited \\textit{van der Pol-Duffing} chain of oscillators with nearest neighbor coupling, a systematic two-widely separated time scale expansion (\\textit{Direct Partition of Motion}) has been employed, in the backdrop of Blekhman's perturbation scheme. This procedure eliminates the fast scale and yields the effective collective dynamics of the array with renormalized stiffness and damping, modified by the high-frequency drive. The resulting dispersion shift controls which normal modes enter the parametric resonance window, allowing highly selective activation of specific bulk modes through external HF tuning. The collective resonant response to the parametric excitation and mode-selection by the HF drive has been analyzed and validated by detailed numerical simulations. The results offer a straightforward, experimentally tractable route to active control of response and channelize energy through selective mode activation in MEMS/NEMS arrays and related resonator platforms."

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions."

    "abstract": "Typical fully conservative discretizations of the Euler compressible single or multi-component fluid equations governed by a real-fluid equation of state exhibit spurious pressure oscillations due to the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic relation between pressure, density, and internal energy. A fully conservative, pressure-equilibrium preserving method and a high-order, fully conservative, approximate pressure-equilibrium preserving method are presented. Both methods are general and can handle an arbitrary equation of state and arbitrary number of species. Unlike existing approaches to discretize the multi-component Euler equations, we do not introduce non conservative updates, overspecified equations, or design for a specific equation of state. The proposed methods are demonstrated on inviscid smooth interface advection problems governed by three equations of state: ideal-gas, stiffened-gas, and van der Waals where we show orders of magnitude reductions in spurious pressure oscillations compared to existing schemes."

    "abstract": "Workflow automation promises substantial productivity gains in everyday document-related tasks. While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced. Code: https://github.com/YJett/AutoDW"

Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $Ψ=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $Ψ\\to \\infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market."

Conventional feedback control schemes, however, exhibit limited accuracy under varying operating conditions because their gains remain static. Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges."

However, expanding paleogenomic datasets indicate that damage patterns are more influenced by burial hydrology and microstructural context than by molecular age or ancestry. Fossils interact with their environments differently: some form closed, water-restricted compartments that preserve minimally damaged endogenous biomolecules, whereas others serve as open molecular reservoirs in which infiltrated environmental biomolecules undergo extensive deamination from repeated water exposure. Reliance on deamination alone can therefore suppress endogenous signals and complicate the interpretation of exogenous sequences. By introducing the molecular sedimentation model for fossil biomolecules, this Perspective outlines a source tracing framework that integrates fossil microstructure, ecological reference sets, and species-specific fragments to enable more reliable molecular inference across diverse depositional environments."

For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $κ^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $α$ and on the limiting curvatures $κ_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(α)\\,r_0(α,κ_+, κ_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(α)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(π/2)=1/(16\\sqrtπ)$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient. As an application we extend a previous result in the literature by showing that any admissible curvilinear polygon that is Dirichlet isospectral to a polygon must itself be a polygon with straight sides."

In this work, we propose a differentiable triangle-based ray tracing pipeline that directly treats triangles as rendering primitives without relying on any proxy geometry. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher rendering quality than existing ray tracing approaches while maintaining real-time rendering performance. Moreover, our pipeline can directly render triangles optimized by the rasterization-based method Triangle Splatting, thus unifying the primitives used in novel-view synthesis."

    "abstract": "Multi-source learning is an emerging area of research in statistics, where information from multiple datasets with heterogeneous distributions is combined to estimate the parameter of interest for a target population without observed responses. We propose a high-dimensional debiased calibration (HDC) method and a multi-source HDC (MHDC) estimator for general estimating equations. The HDC method uses a novel approach to achieve Neyman orthogonality for the target parameter via high-dimensional covariate balancing on an augmented set of covariates. It avoids the augmented inverse probability weighting formulation and leads to an easier optimization algorithm for the target parameter in estimating equations and M-estimation. The proposed MHDC estimator integrates multi-source data while supporting flexible specifications for both density ratio and outcome regression models, achieving multiple robustness against model misspecification. Its asymptotic normality is established, and a specification test is proposed to examine the transferability condition for the multi-source data. Compared to the linear combination of single-source HDC estimators, the MHDC estimator improves efficiency by jointly utilizing all data sources. Through simulation studies, we show that the MHDC estimator accommodates multiple sources and multiple working models effectively and performs better than the existing doubly robust estimators for multi-source learning. An empirical analysis of a meteorological dataset demonstrates the utility of the proposed method in practice."

However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained air pollution forecasting is crucial for urban management and the development of healthy buildings. Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields."

These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions."

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors."

    "abstract": "Interactive communication (IC), i.e., the reciprocal exchange of information between two or more interactive partners, is a fundamental part of human nature. As such, it has been studied across multiple scientific disciplines with different goals and methods. This article provides a cross-disciplinary primer on contemporary IC that integrates psychological mechanisms with acoustic and media-technological constraints across theory, measurement, and applications. First, we outline theoretical frameworks that account for verbal, nonverbal and multimodal aspects of IC, including distinctions between face-to-face and computer-mediated communication. Second, we summarize key methodological approaches, including behavioral, cognitive, and experiential measures of communicative synchrony and acoustic signal quality. Third, we discuss selected applications, i.e. assistive listening technologies, conversational agents, alongside ethical considerations. Taken together, this review highlights how human capacities and technical systems jointly shape IC, consolidating concepts, findings, and challenges that have often been discussed in separate lines of research."

    "abstract": "The environment undergoes perpetual changes that are influenced by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors. Consequently, it exerts a substantial influence on an individual's physical and psychological state, directly or indirectly affecting the evolutionary dynamics of a population described by a network, which in turn can also alter the environment. Furthermore, the evolution of strategies, shaped by reputation, can diverge due to variations in multiple factors. To explore the potential consequences of the mentioned situations, this paper studies how game and reputation dynamics alter the evolution of cooperation. Concretely, game transitions are determined by individuals' behaviors and external uncontrollable factors. The cooperation level of its neighbors reflects individuals' reputation, and further, a general fitness function regarding payoff and reputation is provided. Within the context of the donation game, we investigate the relevant outcomes associated with the aforementioned evolutionary process, considering various topologies for distinct interactions. Additionally, a biased mutation is introduced to gain a deeper insight into the strategy evolution. We detect a substantial increase in the cooperation level through intensive simulations, and some important phenomena are observed, e.g., the unilateral increase of the value of prosocial behavior limits promotion in cooperative behavior in square-lattice networks."

Marchenko-Pastur PCA (MPPCA) is a popular method to reduce noise, but it uses a fixed patch size across the whole image, which doesn't work well in regions with different structures. To address this, we propose an adaptive kernel MPPCA (ak-MPPCA) that selects the best patch size for each voxel based on its local neighborhood. This improves denoising performance by better handling structural variations."

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning (DL) receives great interest for automated analysis of microscopic images with an increasing body of literature supporting its potential. The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three \"C\"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research. By addressing the challenges and offering practical recommendations, this review aims to advance the creation of and availability to high-quality, large-scale datasets, ultimately contributing to the development of generalizable and robust DL models for pathology applications."

The proposed IIBT node extends conventional BTs with probabilistic reasoning, enabling online joint planning and execution across multiple robots. It remains fully compatible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observable and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative manipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4). Experimental results demonstrate that the IIBT framework reduces BT node complexity by over 70%, while maintaining robust, interpretable, and adaptive cooperative behavior under environmental uncertainty."

Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10."

In particular for $r=2$ colours, we show that this threshold lies between $n^{-1/9-o(1)}$ and $n^{-1/11}$.

    "abstract": "The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\\text{B} = 19.8 \\pm 0.5$ $M_\\text{J}$, $e_\\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\\text{B} = 130^{\\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity."

Useful modes of wheel-based soil manipulation and examples of rovers driving with degraded mobility systems are first demonstrated in lunar and Martian analog environments. We show a full-scale rover use its wheels to dig trenches up to 10.6 cm deep, dig holes to estimate soil characteristics, and modify terrain to make it accessible to a smaller robot. We also measure the impact of actuator failure on a rover in lunar simulant. Here, we show the slip doubled on moderate slopes for a damaged drive motor, which would exceed the rover’s operational limits for slip, motivating the need for driving strategies that mitigate mobility loss. We then develop an optimization framework which uses a recently developed terramechanics model to automatically generate both open and closed-loop driving strategies for planetary rovers performing terrain manipulation or operating in a degraded state with no need for hand tuning of behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate the generated driving strategies for soil manipulation and mobility compensation on a rover in a controlled lab setting, where we show that 1) mobility is maintained while manipulating soil; and 2) mobility is regained while experiencing failure of steer and drive actuators."

However, existing SPA designs predominantly exhibit unidirectional actuation or require mechanical transmissions for multidirectional bending actuation, which restricts their operational flexibility. To solve this limitation, this article proposes a multidirectional bending fiber-reinforced soft pneumatic actuator (MDB-FRSPA), and studies its deformation response characteristics under multiple pneumatic boundary conditions. We establish a response surface model for free-end contact force characterization in the MDB-FRSPA. A moment equilibrium-based quasi-static modeling approach is proposed for investigating the correlation between bending angles and internal pressures across varying pressurization states. Building upon this foundation, an experimental testbed is established for validation analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the contact force output and deformation response characteristics under varying pressure conditions closely align with both finite element method results and theoretical predictions. Experimental validation confirms enhanced adaptability and operational stability of the three-mode flexible gripper with self-reconfigurability composed of MDB-FRSPA s during complex grasping tasks."

This letter addresses the one-to-one association constraint, which is particularly relevant in high-fidelity tracking scenarios operating under a high detection-probability (PD) assumption, such as those with high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) sensor arrays. We propose a novel strong association constraint EM (SAC-EM) algorithm that embeds this hard constraint within a principled expectation-maximization (EM) framework. The E-step elegantly formulates the constrained data association as an entropic regularized optimal transport problem, which can be solved efficiently by the iterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm. The M-step then reduces to a weighted Kalman filter update. Comparative simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior tracking accuracy over relevant baselines in the scenarios with constraints context, validating the EM framework as a powerful tool for integrating hard combinatorial constraints into probabilistic estimation."

It extracts distortion features in parallel from both time and frequency domains, and uses a feature fusion mechanism to adaptively focus on important information across different dimensions.

    "abstract": "Existing time-series forecasting methods often struggle to adapt to dynamic scenarios and lack flexibility in prediction. They typically require retraining the model when the prediction length or position changes. Moreover, these methods still face challenges in effectively capturing and utilizing time-position embeddings (PEs). To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel model called D2Vformer. Unlike conventional prediction methods that rely on fixed-length predictors, D2Vformer can directly handle scenarios with arbitrary prediction lengths. In addition, it significantly reduces training resource consumption and proves highly effective in real-world dynamic environments. In D2Vformer, the Date2Vec (D2V) module is devised to leverage timestamp information and feature sequences to generate time PEs. Subsequently, D2Vformer introduces an innovative fusion module that leverages an attention mechanism to capture the mapping between input and target time PEs, thereby enabling flexible prediction. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that D2V outperforms other time-PE methods, while D2Vformer surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both fixed-length and arbitrary-length prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "In the context of gravitational wave detection, the capture control of the test mass (TM) following its release phase is a critical prerequisite for the transition to scientific operation mode. The primary objective is to rapidly stabilize the TMs at the center of the drag-free satellite cavity while avoiding collisions with the cavity boundaries. Notably, the capture control relies on the extremely weak electrostatic forces furnished by electrode plates, thereby presenting substantial challenges for the design of the controller. This paper commences by implementing specific state transformations on the original system and introducing a position constraint mechanism that restricts the TM within a predefined time-varying boundary. To tackle the input saturation issue arising from the weak electrostatic forces, an enhanced dynamic auxiliary system is developed. Building on these improvements, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC) algorithm is proposed, which integrates a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and the improved auxiliary system. Under input saturation condition, the integrated framework ensures that the relative trajectory tracking errors of TMs converge to a small neighborhood around zero within a fixed time. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method when compared with existing approaches."

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of Big Data in domains such as healthcare, genomics, and sensor networks, computationally efficient and effective clustering techniques have become essential for uncovering meaningful patterns. Traditional clustering methods face fundamental limitations in Big Data analysis. K-means is among the fastest known approaches, but it fails to capture non-spherical clusters. Hierarchical clustering can detect arbitrary shapes but suffers from sub-cubic complexity, while many state-of-the-art methods still incur quadratic complexity. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the intrinsic structure of data. In this context, graph-based clustering has emerged as a powerful alternative due to its ability to model geometric relationships and reveal underlying structures. However, existing graph-based techniques typically incur quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability. The objective of this work is to develop a scalable graph-based clustering framework that reduces complexity while preserving clustering quality in large, noisy, and high-dimensional datasets. To achieve this, we propose a fast graph clustering framework with overall complexity <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {O}(N \\lg N)$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$N$</tex-math></inline-formula> denotes the number of data points. The method employs a two-stage dispersion-based partitioning to generate cohesive sub-clusters, followed by the construction of a sparse graph on sub-cluster centers to efficiently capture adjacency. Sub-clusters are then merged iteratively using a gravitational-force-inspired attraction model, enabling the discovery of coherent structures with reduced computation. Extensive experiments on 41 multi-scale datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving average 27.33% higher clustering accuracy while reducing runtime by more than 86.64% on average. These results highlight both the innovation and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, making it highly suitable for Big Data analytics."

    "abstract": "Traditional learning-based energy management strategies (EMSs) often suffer from low training efficiency and implicitly assume that large neural networks can be deployed on onboard controllers to pursue optimal performance, overlooking the challenges of real-world deployment. To address these issues, this paper first proposes an imitation learning-based EMS using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to efficiently approximate expert performance using demonstration data. Then, based on this GAIL-based EMS, a V2X-assisted strategy selection mechanism is proposed to maintain high fuel economy while reducing the network size and computational costs. Specifically, real-world traffic data are clustered into several categories with reduced complexity, allowing dedicated GAIL-based EMSs to be trained for each category. When the hybrid electric bus stops at a bus station, upcoming traffic conditions are obtained via V2X, and the corresponding EMS is selected. Simulation results show that, compared to traditional learning-based strategies, the proposed GAIL-based EMS improves training efficiency by 66.13% and enhances fuel economy by 2.02%. Furthermore, under two real-world driving conditions, the V2X-based adaptive EMS further improves fuel economy by 2.38% and 2.44%, respectively, compared to a static GAIL-based EMS with the same network structure."

    "abstract": "This article presents a thin planar stacked antenna array for simultaneous dual-band beamforming. The uniqueness of the design is the use of passive beamformers in a compact module with sharp filters to enable beamforming when transmitting at closely spaced frequency bands. It uses two identical Rotman lenses to feed two separate series-fed patch arrays operating at 15.3 GHz and 17.2 GHz. The lenses and arrays are vertically stacked, with simplified stripline-to-microstrip transitions, enabling efficient energy transfer between layers to reduce losses. This vertical stacking reduces the required planar area as compared to conventional multi-layer designs with airgaps. To improve performance, elliptic filters are used to achieve sharper transitions from passband to stopband, effectively reducing mutual coupling between the two bands. Low-pass filters are employed for the 15.3 GHz array inputs and band-pass filters are used for the 17.2 GHz array inputs. The entire module was fabricated using standard PCB techniques and successfully validated with measurements. Notably, sidelobe levels were below -10 dB with up to ±40∘ scanning from broadside."

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, over 200 peer-reviewed publications (1996-2025) were analysed. The review begins by identifying gaps in prior literature and classifies enabling Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) technologies into two major domains: network management and modem development. Network-level developments are reviewed through deployment strategies, localisation methods, and routing protocols, with comparative analysis using delivery ratio, delay, energy use, and network lifetime. We examine progress in acoustic, optical, magnetic induction, and radio frequency (RF)-based modems. We discuss practical considerations of underwater system design and propose Modem Performance Index (MPI)-a unified metric for evaluating modem designs based on parameters such as range, bandwidth, energy efficiency, and cost. Through these analyses, this study identifies research gaps and provides guidelines for the development of efficient, robust, and cost-effective underwater communication systems tailored to various deployment scenarios."

There are few studies that focus holistically on HAZMAT throughout the entire supply chain. Accordingly, this study critically evaluated literature pertaining to HAZMAT storage, transportation, disposal, and green supply chains in the United States. Pragmatism, qualitative content analysis, and induction on twenty-nine academic articles identified twenty-four codes, eleven categories, and four themes, which are presented in a comprehensive network diagram. Only nine of the articles mentioned GrSCM, suggesting a need for further research in GrSCM adoption measures to increase mitigation. The posited model suggests implementations to promote GrSCM initiatives throughout the HAZMAT supply chain holistically to promote resiliency and reduce the risk for HAZMAT incidents."

Despite advances, progress in malaria control has slowed due to limited resources and dependence on manual microscopy for diagnosis. Artificial intelligence offers a promising path for rapid, low-cost screening. In this work, we present a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning for automated malaria detection from blood smear images. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in classifying parasitized versus uninfected cells. To support deployment in real-world settings, we developed a middleware framework for mobile inference. In addition, we integrate an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detector based on RRRCF, which flags anomalous inputs responsible for rare CNN misclassifications. Together, the CNN and OOD components yield effective prediction accuracy, demonstrating that compact, mobile-compatible deep learning systems can significantly improve malaria diagnostics in resource-limited environments."

While trusted hardware modules can protect such designs, they pose significant risks for resource-constrained platforms like IoT devices, which often lack secure storage for biometrics. To address this limitation, we propose an authentication framework based on Publicly Evaluatable Perceptual (PEP) hash, which combines lightweight homomorphic encryption (HE) with perceptual hashing (PH) to eliminate the need for local fingerprint storage. In our framework, an IoT device generates a PH of the user's fingerprint via Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) and transmits it securely to the server for verification without exposing the PH algorithm or persisting biometric templates locally. We formally analyze the security guarantees of the design and demonstrate its practicality using benchmark fingerprint datasets and established PH algorithms. By decoupling privacy protection from matching accuracy, our approach enables usercentric biometric authentication that is viable on devices without trusted computing modules (TPMs) and aligns with privacy-bydesign principles."

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by intelligently manipulating the propagation environment. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (C-NOMA) network augmented with RIS under the practical constraint of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We consider a downlink scenario where a base station communicates with multiple users via an RIS and a decode- and-forward (DF) relay, forming a cooperative architecture to improve coverage and reliability. Current wireless technology is primarily aimed at boosting radio signal transmission in the context of creating 5G to 6G technology. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS), Large Intelligent Surface (LIS), or Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS) is a novel technology that uses electromagnetically controlled surfaces to integrate into current infrastructure. Because RIS passively reflects messages rather than amplification mechanisms like relays, RIS-assisted communication is more energy efficient than traditional delivery approaches. We will examine coverage performance, which is often expressed in terms of outage probability, if RIS is implemented on a radio access system using the Non- Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique used in 5G network scheme, considering the condition of the Imperfect Channel State Information (ip-CSI) via Rayleigh fading channel, in this study. Because of channel estimate errors, perfect channel state information (p-CSI) conditions are difficult to achieve in realistic wireless systems."

    "abstract": "This paper reports a plant-scale deployment of an inspection system for refinery, power, and chemical sites. The system performs on-site 3D modeling with RGB and LiDAR and provides robot self-localization via SLAM in a globally consistent frame, enabling reliable route checks and operator displays even in multi-level structures. On top of this frame, daily/weekly/monthly patrols and analog-gauge readings are executed by a schedule; failures, low confidence, or high-risk alerts trigger a policy-driven escalation from re-capture to close-up sensing to robot swap and, if needed, human intervention. Because field operations mix fixed sensors and operator calls with concurrent events, the controller assigns and reassigns heterogeneous robots by combining travel time, payload suitability, battery/health, and floor accessibility, and logs capture outcomes, latencies, and quality indicators for routine reporting. While the implementation uses a fast-livo family LiDAR–IMU–visual stack on ROS 2, this is an implementation choice; the contribution is the coupling of 3D modeling, SLAM-based localization, scheduling, reassignment, and logging into a procedure that remains durable in real plants. Validation comes from deployments in a refinery (2023) and a power facility (2024), with an extended configuration for a chemical plant (2025) that accounts for multi-level layouts and hazardous-area constraints."

A risk optimization model is formulated to balance expected power surplus and deficiency, ensuring power adequacy and network connectivity within islands. A genetic algorithm optimizes the islanding scheme to maximize DG utilization. An entropy weight-based evaluation framework is introduced, incorporating System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Average Service Availability Index (ASAI), and Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS). Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves a SAIFI of 1.8051 (events/year) and ASAI of 0.9999, reducing SAIDI and EENS by 0.0155 hours/year and 1.0753 MWh, respectively.

The cost function considers multiple factors, including path distance, gear transitions, steering switches, path type, and backward driving segments, to evaluate paths that avoid obstacles. The simulation results indicate that this method successfully addresses the challenge of creating smooth, executable parking paths that drivers can follow comfortably to reach their goal position."

Additionally, we aimed to learn more about the important people farmers interact with and how it affects their success and a solution's integration. Farmers have expressed that there is a need for a solution, but simultaneously, limited disposable income to spend on a more efficient solution. The team conducted a financial analysis of two solutions, and ultimately if farmers cannot afford the solution, then this problem will continue. This research delves into viable solutions to address this problem while keeping sustainability, effectiveness, and affordability at the forefront. Simultaneously, this research describes the need for a solution and where the solution and integration space are currently. However, our findings reveal that there is no market-based solution in Kenya at the time. The industrial and economical limitations constrain the “fix” for this massive problem. Based on other countries' success in minimizing this problem, the Kenyan government must intervene and implement a large-scale solution."

Clustering was based on location, depth, and magnitude, with performance evaluated using Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index. K-Means produced three well-separated clusters aligned with major tectonic structures, achieving the highest Silhouette Score (0.31). K-Medoids offered finer spatial resolution and the best separation (Davies-Bouldin Index: 1.05), effectively highlighting localized seismic zones. FCM provided the highest Calinski-Harabasz Index (2227.74), capturing transitional regions through overlapping clusters. All models successfully classified the data without noise. The results show that K-Means is optimal for broad seismic zoning, while K-Medoids and FCM offer complementary insights into regional fault complexity and uncertainty. These findings support the integration of clustering methods into regional seismic hazard analysis."

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (enable step-by-step reasoning) are now widely adopted for their enhanced problem-solving capabilities. This perspective, however, often overlooks that the performance gains from CoT are not universal. This study investigates the relation between accuracy, latency, and token consumption cost across different mathematical task complexities. An empirical analysis is conducted on two variants of the kimi family: traditional model (kimi-dev-72b) and CoT-enabled model (kimi-vl-a3b-thinking). These models were evaluated on 500 questions sampled from three diverse benchmark datasets: the GSM8K, Nguyen-Brat/asdiv, and SAT-MATH. The results show that traditional LLM achieves higher or equal accuracy, with significantly lower latency and greater token efficiency. Our findings indicate that for simpler problems, computational overhead generated by CoT models often outweighs the minimal increase in accuracy.

    "abstract": "An intelligent prediction and optimization algorithm of intelligent building energy management system (EMS) with deep learning is proposed. The system architecture includes three modules: data acquisition, intelligent prediction and optimal decision-making. Multi-source heterogeneous data are collected in real time through sensor networks, and features are extracted and energy consumption is predicted by using deep learning model. In the study, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) combined with spatiotemporal attention mechanism and multi task learning framework was used to effectively improve prediction accuracy, and an online learning module was designed to cope with changes in data distribution. The optimization algorithm is based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which achieves the optimization of device operation mode and energy allocation scheme by defining state space, action space, and reward function, significantly reducing energy consumption and operating costs. The experimental results show that the LSTM model improves the prediction accuracy by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15\\% \\sim 20\\%$</tex> compared with the traditional time series model, and the multi-task learning further optimizes the prediction performance. DRL optimization strategy effectively reduces the power grid purchase and improves the utilization rate of energy storage system during peak hours, and achieves a 10% reduction in daily operating costs, which verifies the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm."

This work addresses the problem of selecting optimal subsets of software metrics that preserve essential information while reducing computational overhead and complexity. We propose a novel approach that combines dimensionality reduction techniques with heuristic optimization to identify the most representative metric subsets. Our methodology uses a UMAP-derived objective function to measure information loss and employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to search for optimal combinations across different subset sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that small subsets of carefully selected metrics can effectively capture the structural properties of software projects. This research contributes to making software quality measurement more accessible and actionable for development teams."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates user adoption of an AI-powered tourism application by combining the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). With the increasing integration of AI in tourism tools like ChatGPT Trip Planner and Tripadvisor, understanding user acceptance is crucial as AI distrust might affect intention to visit. Thus, studying the user adoption toward AI-powered tourism app is crucial before developing and implementing it in real life. By combining Technology Acceptance Model and System Usability Scale, the user adoption study was conducted using a prototype of an AI-powered tourism mobile app, Travelingo. Data was collected from 77 participants with diverse backgrounds. The findings indicate that usability positively influences intention to use, and perceived usefulness strongly predicts intention to use. However, AI trust and data privacy, while scoring moderately high independently, did not significantly moderate intention to use which is affected by perceived usefulness. The results suggest that for this participant group, perceived usefulness was the primary driver of intention to use, potentially overshadowing concerns about trust and data privacy. This highlights the complex interplay of factors in AI adoption. While usability is foundational, the perceived benefits of AI features are principal for user intention to use. This paper also proposed the idea that the influence of trust and privacy may vary based on user characteristics and the perceived risk level of the application domain."

Second, a year-long generalization test trains on a full year of data (about <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3.5 \\times$</tex> passes) and then evaluates on two other climates (San Diego and Brest) with realistic occupancy. We assess learning speed, daily average cumulative score, comfort violations during occupied periods (15-minute counts), and energy use (AHU electricity plus district heating). In the weekly test, SAC-Gumbel achieved a better cumulative score (-449.17 vs. -501.33) and used less energy (7.16 GJ vs. 9.05 GJ) than PPO. In the year-long tests, SAC-Gumbel lowered cumulative penalty scores by 31.85 % and reduced occupiedperiod comfort violations by 30.12 % relative to PPO, but consumed 83.04 % more energy. Overall, the off-policy method learned faster and provided stronger comfort control, at the cost of higher energy in cross-climate deployment."

Traditional manual detection methods have some problems such as low efficiency and strong subjectivity. Based on deep learning (DL) technology, this study developed an image recognition and intelligent diagnosis model for tobacco leaf diseases. ResNet-50 architecture is adopted as the basic model, and targeted improvements are made, including adding convolution layer for specific diseases and introducing attention mechanism. Through the large-scale tobacco leaf disease image data set, the data set contains 5000 images, covering a variety of common disease types. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the improved ResNet- 50 model is as high as 93.41%, the recall rate is 92.87%, and the F1 score is 93.16%, which is significantly better than other related studies. The model has a better recognition effect on disease types with a large number of samples, indicating that sample distribution is very important to performance. The model proposed in this study shows excellent accuracy and generalization ability, and provides an effective solution for automatic identification and intelligent diagnosis of tobacco leaf diseases."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an analysis method of transmission line channel state evolution based on digital twin model is proposed. By constructing a virtual model that is highly consistent with physical entities, combining with the mechanical, environmental and image data collected in real time by multi-source heterogeneous sensor networks, the dynamic simulation, real-time monitoring and fault prediction of transmission line channel state are realized by using physical information neural network (PINN) and improved LSTM network. In the research, the hybrid networking technology of LoRa and 5G is used to optimize the data transmission efficiency, and the evolution of line state under complex working conditions such as icing is accurately predicted by the physical-data fusion modeling method. Taking the icing growth process of a 220kV transmission line in southwest China during the winter cold wave as an example, the validity of the model is verified, and the average error of icing thickness prediction is less than 7.5%, which is significantly better than the industry standard. The results show that the digital twin model can effectively reflect the deterioration trend of the line state, and warn the potential risks in advance, providing scientific basis for operation and maintenance decision-making, and significantly improving the efficiency and economy of operation and maintenance."

This study investigates the impact of color space transformations on the performance of deep learning models for classifying Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Images were transformed from RGB into HSV, HLS, LAB, YUV, YCrCb, and Grayscale, and evaluated across six architectures: VGG16, DenseNet121, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and several hybrid combinations. The results indicate that color space selection significantly influences classification accuracy. VGG16 trained on HSVtransformed images achieved 96.15 % accuracy, while a hybrid model combining DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2 trained on HLS images achieved 94.23 %. These luminance separated color spaces enhanced feature extraction by isolating chrominance components, leading to improved generalization under variable imaging conditions. In contrast, YUV and YCrCb transformations resulted in unstable convergence and reduced accuracy. These findings underscore color space transformation as a simple yet effective preprocessing step to improve biomedical image classification, particularly for deployment on resourceconstrained systems."

Machine Learning IDS have been delivering high precision and good tracking on novel threats in recent decades. In our research, the efficiency of a ML algorithm called J48-Decision Tree is analyzed and differentiated throughout this research to three other ML algorithms: Neural based Networks (NN), Supportive Vector Machines (SVM), and a flexible narrative web based learning algorithm called fast machine learning (FML). The algorithms were put through their paces in terms of precision rate (PR), selection rate(SR), faulty alarm rate(FAR) and precision of four various attacks on network.

However, its reliability is often degraded by noise, environmental dynamics, and asynchronous packet arrivals. To address these challenges, we propose a preprocessing-driven framework that integrates amplitude extraction, Butterworth filtering, and a novel time-aligned synchronization strategy for multi-ESP CSI streams. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is then employed to perform localization tasks. We evaluate two scenarios: single-ESP for near/far classification and dual-ESP for left/right localization. Experimental results show that, without synchronization, the dual-ESP model achieved only 78.5% accuracy, whereas the proposed time-aligned preprocessing improved performance to 95.5% with a 2-second window. These findings demonstrate that careful preprocessing substantially enhances the robustness of lightweight models, underscoring its role as a core design principle for resource-efficient CSI-based localization."

    "abstract": "Social media has emerged as a critical frontier in public health, serving as both an information platform and a vector for the rapid spread of health-related false information. Infodemiology, the science of identifying and mitigating the consequences of infodemics, is increasingly vital for addressing public health challenges. The proliferation of false information, accelerated by Generative AI, poses significant risks, leading to adverse health outcomes, unnecessary suffering, and systemic burdens on health care providers and practitioners. This study presents an AI Agentic-like approach to crisis preparedness and response by leveraging AIIML analytics to develop a Capture/Track/Respond (CTR) framework for detecting and counteracting medical false information in real-time social media streams. Our analysis demonstrates high accuracy in identifying false information, enabling timely detection of developing issues, rapid interventions and reliable implementation of corrective measures. We focus on health crises as a specific concern, but the findings can be broadly generalized to any crisis. Our research question addresses the urgent need for scalable, data-driven tools to bolster global crisis preparedness and response, with a starting focus on emerging health crises. The CTR (Capture-Track-Respond) methodology is a template for an efficient, AI-powered framework for rapid detection and mitigation of false information-a critical capability in emergent scenarios where misinformation undermines public trust and safety. Given the potential for generalizability, CTR applies across diverse crisis types, from health emergencies to climate disruptions, which are typically reflected immediately in social media discourse. The flexibility of the approach enables targeted, culturally adaptive messaging via locally preferred digital channels, positioning CTR as a practical tool for humanitarian outreach. By providing health professionals with tools to engage underserved and marginalized populations in real time, this approach advances both global resiliency and health equity."

Three concepts were assessed by 11 design experts using structured Delphi methodology, selecting a tent-inspired collapsible design. Through iterative prototyping and computational optimization, we developed a lightweight (12.5 pounds), rapidly deployable (8-12 minutes) mPHC system. Mixed-method evaluation with 49 users demonstrated good satisfaction across form (4.12), function (4.31), collapsibility (4.24), portability (4.18), and deployability (4.27) parameters.

    "abstract": "Containerization is the mainstream of current software development, which enables software to be used across platforms without additional configuration of running environment. However, many images created by developers are redundant and contain unnecessary code, packages, and components. This excess not only leads to bloated images that are cumbersome to transmit and store but also increases the attack surface, making them more vulnerable to security threats. Therefore, image slimming has emerged as a significant area of interest. Nevertheless, existing image slimming technologies face challenges, particularly regarding the incomplete extraction of environment dependencies required by project code. In this paper, we present a novel image slimming model named δ–SCALPEL. This model employs static data dependency analysis to extract the environment dependencies of the project code and utilizes a directed graph named command link directed graph for modeling the image’s file system. We select 30 NPM projects and two official Docker Hub images to construct a dataset for evaluating δ-SCALPEL. The evaluation results show that δ–SCALPEL is robust and can reduce image sizes by up to 61.4% while ensuring the normal operation of these projects."

This is the first study to use the off-diagonal to diagonal capacitance ratio (ODDCR) in the matrix as a quantitative metric to analyze coupling effects in high-frequency scenarios. We then propose two routing layout schemes for RDL interposers: an optimized Ground-Signal-Ground (GSG) configuration in full-coverage wrap mode and a Ground-Signal-Signal (GSS) configuration with multiple signal units. These schemes support high-density packaging and enhance signal routability, aligning with the recent HBM3 and HBM4 protocols. To validate the signal integrity of these proposed configurations, we analyze them in both frequency and time domains, comparing their performance with conventional multiple striplines and reported staggered GSG configurations. The results demonstrate significant improvements in insertion loss, return loss, near-end crosstalk, far-end crosstalk, and eye diagrams. This work provides practical guidelines for designing RDL interposers, ensuring high data transfer rates while addressing signal integrity issues, and offers insights into optimizing interconnect layouts for high-speed channels in 2.5-D ICs."

However, there are still two major challenges in practical applications: insufficient semantic compression due to the computing constraints of the source device, and poor signal generation at the sink device caused by harsh communication environment. To this end, this work fully leverages multi-modal interactive large AI model (LAM) distillation to enhance sparse feature representation for dynamic residual compression, while utilizing LAM adversarial feature mapping to repair the feature impairment for accurate signal generation, thereby achieving low latency and high reliable communication. Specifically, we first propose a scalable cross-modal semantic communication framework, which constructs a multi-modal semantic knowledge base (MSKB) by semantic similarity to support cross-modal semantic codec. On this basis, residual-guided cross-modal semantic encoding (RCSE) is designed, which employs video-infrared bidirectional knowledge distillation to lightweight LAM for feature extraction, and initially compresses features by inter-modal correlations. Further, according to the link state, the similar features in MSKB are dynamically stripped and the residual features are compressed for low-latency transmission. Additionally, an adversarial mapping-based cross-modal semantic decoding (AMCSD) is developed, which leverages adversarial mutual information (MI) to map features in LAM to impaired features, and discriminate semantic fidelity to enhance the mapping robustness, ensuring accurate signal generation. Finally, an emergency simulation platform is constructed. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme reduces the transmission latency by 27.64% and improves the signal generation precision by 14.06%."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel low-complexity syndrome-based linear programming (SB-LP) decoding algorithm for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Under the code-capacity model, the SB-LP decoder can be used as a standalone decoder; however, it is particularly powerful when used as a post-processing step following syndrome-based min-sum (SB-MS) decoding. In the latter case, the proposed decoder is shown to be capable of significantly reducing the error floor of the SB-MS decoder for both flooded and layered SB-MS scheduling. Also, an early stopping criterion is introduced to decide when to activate the SB-LP algorithm, avoiding executing a predefined maximum number of iterations for the SB-MS decoder. Simulation results show, for some example hypergraph and generalized bicycle (GB) codes, that the proposed decoder can lower the error floor by one to three orders of magnitude compared to SB-MS for the same total number of decoding iterations. Furthermore, for the class of GB codes, it is shown that as the minimum distance of the code increases, the logical error rate provided by the proposed decoder also improves, indicating that the solution is scalable. Under the circuit-level noise model, it is shown that while the SB-LP decoder does not fully replace the need for ordered statistics decoding (OSD) when flooded SB-MS is used as a preliminary step, it reduces the number of calls to the OSD post-processor, which directly impacts the overall latency. Additionally, the method offers a syndrome-matching decoder and improves the accuracy of the logical error rate for bivariate bicycle codes of distances six to eighteen, particularly at low error rates, when compared to the BP+OSD benchmark."

    "abstract": "Despite advances in deep learning for remote sensing building extraction (RSBE), Multi-target Domain RSBE (MD-RSBE) remains challenging, as it requires transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to multiple unlabeled target domains, with domain shifts in texture, style, and semantics. Existing domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) methods face significant limitations: DA requires target-domain training, while DG needs multi-source training, leading to high training costs and low generalization in practical MD-RSBE scenarios. To address this, we propose a Multi-view Augmented Single-source Domain Generalization (MASDG) method, which effectively mitigates domain shifts across RS source and target domains for robust MD-RSBE performance by enriching the diversity of the source domain through multi-view augmentation and enforcing semantic consistency. Specifically, MASDG consists of three key components: Texture-level Domain Augmentation (TDA) module, Style-level Domain Augmentation (SDA) module and Semantic-invariant Representation Learning (SRL). To mitigate texture-level domain shift, TDA first introduces parameter-optimized multi-layer random convolution to modify the texture of source image, generating texture-augmented image pairs for simulating real-world texture diversity across various RS domains. Then, with each image pair from TDA, SDA employs two paralleled encoders, namely the general feature encoder and the batch-guided style encoder, to formulate multi-view building features, further mitigating style-level domain shift. Finally, SRL ensures semantic-invariant representation learning via a dual mechanism, including multi-view segmentation loss and semantic consistency loss. The former generates predictions from diverse feature views (original, texture-augmented, style-augmented, etc.), while the latter performs semantic alignment by minimizing distribution discrepancies among predictions, bridging semantic inconsistency to enable robust segmentation. Extensive experiments across three different MD-RSBE settings with 7 different target domains demonstrate that our MASDG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin."

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based food recognition has made significant progress in predicting food types from eating occasion images. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) continuously learning new food classes without forgetting previously learned ones, and (2) handling the long-tailed distribution of food images, where a few common classes and many more rare classes. To address these, food recognition methods should focus on long-tailed continual learning. In this work, We introduce a dataset that encompasses 186 American foods along with comprehensive annotations. We also introduce three new benchmark datasets, VFN186-LT, VFN186-INSULIN and VFN186-T2D, which reflect real-world food consumption for healthy populations, insulin takers and individuals with type 2 diabetes without taking insulin. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that improves the generalization ability for instance-rare food classes using a knowledge distillation-based predictor to avoid misalignment of representation during continual learning. Additionally, we introduce an augmentation technique by integrating class-activation-map (CAM) and CutMix to improve generalization on instance-rare food classes. Our method, evaluated on Food101-LT, VFN-LT, VFN186-LT, VFN186-INSULIN, and VFN186-T2DM, shows significant improvements over existing methods. An ablation study highlights further performance enhancements, demonstrating its potential for real-world food recognition applications."

Unlike existing methods that optimize only the weights with fixed element positions, we jointly optimize the element positions and weights to achieve improved performance in terms of a lower PSL. However, the resulting problem is nonconvex and challenging due to the coupling of optimization variables and fractional objective function. In order to deal with the problem, we present an efficient approach by leveraging the alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. The proposed approach decomposes the complex problem into several tractable subproblems, each of which has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved. Numerical results show that the proposed approach can obtain desired beampatterns. Compared with the traditional counterparts, the proposed approach achieves improved performance with the guarantee of all the constraints being well satisfied."

    "abstract": "Voxel-based neural networks have been widely applied to the processing of large-scale outdoor point cloud data, which first convert points into voxels and then extract features using several sparse convolution and normal convolution layers. The hardware implementation of these networks suffers from complex rulebook generation, irregular memory access, and low hardware utilization. Meanwhile, these networks still have much data sparsity. In this paper, we propose an energy and area-efficient query-based sparsity-aware accelerator for voxel-based point cloud neural networks, namely QSAP. Specifically, a dedicated unit is used to improve the efficiency of rulebook generation. A query-based input feature-writing method is proposed to enhance parallel reading potential. An efficient weight-mapping method is introduced to store unpruned weights in on-chip buffers. A novel input-feature-reading method with consecutive queries is proposed to enable out-of-order execution of convolution operations, thereby improving hardware utilization. The hardware utilization is further enhanced by a proposed pop strategy that minimizes the total number of empty FIFOs. The MAC related to zero value is also skipped in this process. As a result, QSAP achieves superior performance on 22 nm technology with the throughput, energy efficiency, area efficiency, frame rate, and frame energy of 1074 GOPS, 7.79 TOPS/W, 590 GOPS/mm<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {^{2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>, 35.2 FPS, and 3.91 mJ/Frame, respectively, better than state-of-the-art works."

    "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models rely on wireless networks for distributed training approaches, which are essential to meet the immense computational and data demands. However, the stochastic nature of wireless environments introduces significant challenges such as variable delays, noise interference, and packet loss, which lead to degraded gradient synchronization and hinder model convergence. In this work, we propose a novel communication-aware distributed training (CADT) framework that integrates real-time channel state information (CSI) feedback into the gradient aggregation process. Unlike conventional methods that assume static or ideal communication conditions, CADT dynamically reweights gradients from each node based on instantaneous channel quality, enabling robust aggregation under adverse wireless conditions. By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each node based on instantaneous channel conditions, CADT effectively compensates for wireless impairments, thereby ensuring more reliable gradient aggregation and significantly improving both convergence speed and final model accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and SVHN using Vision Transformer and ResNet-50 demonstrate that CADT outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence, accuracy, and communication efficiency. In addition, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes convergence guarantees under realistic wireless conditions, thereby advancing the theoretical foundation of distributed optimization in non-ideal communication environments.Our framework offers a practical solution for real-world scenarios such as edge computing, where communication constraints and environmental variability are dominant factors."

An auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (GAN) has therefore emerged as a dominant paradigm for generating multiclass data to mitigate this issue; however, this framework suffers from low intraclass diversity and gradient instability. Specifically, the classifier's strong class-label separability compresses the category's support space, reducing diversity and also causing optimization conflicts. To this end, this article proposes a discriminative condition-guided generative model (DCGM) to synthesize high-fidelity data across categories for induction motor fault diagnosis under small-sample conditions. First, a discriminative classifier is integrated into the conditional GAN to replace the auxiliary classifier, theoretically alleviating diversity constraints and instability. After that, an adaptive feature matching loss based on supervised contrastive learning is proposed to enhance the synthetic quality of the class-label data. Then, three novel evaluation metrics are developed to quantitatively assess the generated data quality. Extensive experiments on induction motor datasets demonstrate that DCGM achieves state-of-the-art evaluation scores compared to diffusion-, transformer-, and GANs-based models. Finally, small-sample fault diagnosis further validates the superiority of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential in engineering applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to introduce the novel discriminative generative framework for conditional data generation in the IFD field."

Nevertheless, the materials composing ASSTFLBs are highly reactive with moisture, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in air, triggering spontaneous chemical reactions that cause material degradation. This phenomenon leads to a rapid decline in battery performance and severely restricts the practical utilization of ASSTFLBs. To address this challenge, we propose a high airtightness Si<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>N<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>/Al<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>O<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>/PDMS composite passivation film for ASSTFLB protection at high temperature.

Additionally, a 15-μm PDMS film is spin-coated to enhance the mechanical robustness of the composite structure. The composite passivation film exhibits excellent thermal stability, chemical stability and mechanical robustness, thereby offering enhanced passivation for ASSTFLBs at high temperature. Experimental results indicate that, ASSTFLBs with composite passivation film exhibit remarkable cycling stability in air at room temperature, retaining 80.5% of their initial capacity after 150 cycles, which is significantly superior to that of unpassivated ASSTFLBs, which only maintain 4.7%. More importantly, under an industrial-grade high temperature of 85 °C, ASSTFLBs with composite passivation film show good cycling and thermal stability, retaining 90.2% of their initial capacity after 100 cycles in air, confirming superior thermal and air stability. These findings underscore the strong potential of the proposed passivation strategy for enabling reliable ASSTFLB operation in real-world IoT applications."

    "abstract": "Time series data are collected in real time across industrial, office and household environments through Internet of Things sensors and exhibit characteristic patterns and periodicities. In field deployments, however, quality anomalies such as sensor drift, intermittent dropouts, flatlines and external interference occur frequently and degrade the reliability of analytics and control. To address this, this paper applies unsupervised anomaly detection and suppresses over-detection by employing conservative thresholding policies based on global statistics and percentiles so that only high-confidence anomalies are declared. Beyond point anomalies at specific instants, the procedure aggregates sustained deviations into intervals, attaches explicit semantic labels, and persists them as metadata within a user-oriented web platform. A demonstration on indoor air-quality time series collected in an office shows that spikes and sustained episodes can be detected and labeled reliably. The resulting labels enable the selection of clean segments and the exclusion of anomalous intervals, and provide supervision for constructing supervised and semi-supervised datasets, thereby improving operational reliability and model performance."

Therefore, its precise classification is crucial for optimizing economic value and ensuring quality control. In recent years, although CNN and Transformer models have shown great potential in fruit classification in the field of deep learning, they face challenges in handling complex image relationships and dealing with high computational demands. This paper proposes a novel classification method for Winter jujube that synergistically combines the strengths of CNN and Transformer models and incorporates a weakly supervised region partitioning for enhanced feature extraction. This method stacks the CNN backbone and Transformer, where CNN shows strength of capturing features and Transformer exhibits global relationship in each feature. This approach specifically addresses the challenges of distinguishing subtle variations within Winter jujube varieties. Demonstrated through rigorous testing on Winter jujube datasets, this method achieved a notable accuracy of 93.09%, surpassing several established baseline models. Overall, the classification strategy developed in this study significantly enhances the precision and efficiency of Winter jujube classification, marking a substantial advancement for quality control in agricultural practices."

In this paper, we aim to select the lightweight segmentation model that is most suitable for RTL (Register - Transistor Level) implementation for the construction of lane recognition system of autonomous driving system. To this end, we compared-analyzed the representative real-time models Fast-SCNN, BiSeNetV2, and DDRNet in the same learning environment.

    "abstract": "This study discusses the application of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Entropy Weight Method (EWM) assisted by high-resolution images in flood risk identification of transmission lines. As an important part of power system, the safe operation of transmission lines is very important to social economy and people's life. The secondary disasters caused by floods often cause the interruption and damage of transmission lines, so it is very important to accurately identify potential risk areas for preventive measures and reducing losses. In this study, a three-dimensional evaluation index system is constructed by using high-resolution image technology and AHP-EWM, including three dimensions of danger, sensitivity and vulnerability, in order to comprehensively evaluate the flood risk of transmission lines. Through geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction, key information such as water boundary, vegetation coverage and surface coverage type are extracted. Then, combined with expert knowledge and data dispersion, the weight of each risk factor is determined, and the flood risk of transmission lines is evaluated and ranked by TOPSIS model. The practical application shows that this method can effectively identify high-risk areas, provide scientific basis for the planning, maintenance and emergency response of transmission lines, and improve the ability of disaster prevention and reduction of power system. The research results emphasize the effectiveness of highresolution image technology and AHP-EWM in flood risk identification of transmission lines, which provides a new perspective and method for risk assessment in related fields."

    "abstract": "With the commercial popularization of 5G networks, virtual reality (VR) technology is entering a new stage of development. High quality virtual reality video services, with their immersive experience, are gradually being favored by a large number of users. However, VR technology requires extremely high latency for data transmission, as any small delay can cause the virtual world perceived by users to break, greatly affecting the overall user experience. In this context, 5G slicing technology has emerged, which has the ability to provide independent, isolated, and customized network resources for different services or applications on the same physical network. This technology makes the allocation of network resources more flexible and efficient, providing solid technical support for low latency transmission. This article proposes a low latency 5G slicing transmission algorithm for VR, whose core lies in ensuring real-time and stable transmission of VR video data through refined network resource allocation and traffic management. The experimental results show that the algorithm can significantly reduce the latency of data transmission, improve the smoothness and user experience of VR videos."

    "abstract": "Early, accessible detection of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains challenging due to invasive and costly standard methods. Here, we explore a non-invasive, voice-based approach to distinguish healthy controls from lung cancer (Stages I–IV) and COPD (Stages I–III) patients. We collected speech recordings from 128 Turkish-speaking individuals (42 healthy, 50 lung cancer, 36 COPD) reading standardized paragraphs in a quiet setting. Recordings were down-mixed to mono, high-pass filtered, and segmented into 100 ms frames. From each frame, we extracted time-domain statistics (RMS, skewness, zero-crossing rate), frequency-domain descriptors (spectral centroid, bandwidth, flux), MFCCs 1–13, spectrogram and chroma features, and learned embeddings via a 64-dimensional autoencoder and PCA-reduced components. Dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering revealed that learned embeddings and select spectral features achieved clear grouping of healthy, COPD, and lung cancer samples. An XGBoost classifier leveraging all features, coupled with SHAP analysis, identified higher-order MFCCs (MFCC5–MFCC7), spectral bandwidth, skewness, and zero-crossing rate as most discriminative. Physiological interpretation suggests that COPD-induced airflow obstruction leads to breathiness and turbulence—reflected in elevated zero-crossing rates and amplitude irregularities—whereas lung cancer yields formant distortions and heavier spectral tails, captured by higher-order MFCCs and kurtosis. These findings underscore the promise of acoustic biomarkers for scalable, cost-effective respiratory disease screening."

Specifically, comparative experiments and attention mechanisms are designed in conjunction with the ConvLSTM model to assess the contribution of dual-polarization radar data (such as $\\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{H}}, \\mathbf{Z}_{\\mathbf{D R}}$, and $K_{D P}$) in the near-term forecasting of severe convective precipitation. At the same time, a dynamic weight parameter calculation method is developed to dynamically adjust the precipitation estimation weight parameters, improving estimation accuracy. The experimental results show that dual-polarization radar data contributes significantly, and the dynamic weighted multi-channel data fusion method can greatly enhance the accuracy of near-term forecasting in the airport terminal area, enhancing the model’s spatiotemporal and seasonal adaptability, effectively dealing with severe convective weather."

    "abstract": "Smart home IoT devices are increasingly exploited by botnets to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, largely due to weak security configurations and limited processing power. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) rely on deep packet inspection or signature matching, which are computationally heavy and raise privacy concerns when applied to home networks. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving lightweight IDS that detects botnet driven anomalies using only flow-based features, avoiding payload inspection and reducing computational overhead. The system integrates Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost in a hybrid ensemble via weighted soft voting, trained on the TON_IoT dataset containing realistic benign and malicious traffic. During preprocessing, non-predictive attributes were removed, and the feature set was reduced to 38 key attributes using correlation filtering and feature importance ranking. A stratified <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80: 20$</tex> train-test split with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$z$</tex>-score normalization ensured balanced evaluation. The ensemble achieved 99.61 % accuracy, with precision (99.63 %), recall (99.59 %), and F1-score (99.61 %), outperforming standalone RF and XGBoost models. Compared to deep learning-based IDS, the proposed approach delivers fast inference, lower resource consumption, and preserves user privacy, making it suitable for deployment on constrained smart home gateways and routers. This work demonstrates that lightweight ensemble learning can effectively mitigate botnet threats while ensuring privacy and feasibility for ubiquitous smart home environments."

This exploratory study examines how small-scale farmers and their mentors in Colorado's Front Range utilize various technologies and techniques to conserve water, revealing obstacles in adopting water-efficient practices. A key finding of this work is the lack of localized, contextual knowledge across experience levels, paired with a strong interest from new farmers in expanding water-related education. Data suggest that agriculture accelerator pro-grams could serve as vital platforms for developing co-produced water conservation technologies (financial and material investment) and techniques (labor and time investment). However, decentralized mentor-based knowledge exchange presents equity barriers to vital information and collaboration. By documenting and analyzing these approaches, this research offers valuable insights for agriculture accelerator programs to better support water resilience in Colorado's farming communities."

As climate change becomes a dominant theme on social media, accurately interpreting public sentiment in local languages is critical for shaping effective communication and policy. While BERT has shown strong contextual understanding in various NLP tasks, and KNN remains a widely used baseline, there is a lack of studies directly comparing these models within the context of Indonesian climate discourse. This study is one of the first to quantitatively benchmark BERT against KNN for this domain, using multiple statistical significance tests (Mann-Whitney U, Cohen’s d, permutation testing, Bonferroni correction, and Bayesian hypothesis testing). Our results show that BERT consistently outperforms KNN across key metrics, highlighting the model's suitability for capturing nuanced sentiment in complex environmental discussions. These findings offer a novel contribution to Indonesian-language NLP and underscore the importance of advanced deep learning models for supporting climate communication and sentiment monitoring."

Experiments on quadruped robot video with MobileNetV2 show that MASA estimates blur in the range of 0.2–1.7 px and provides a spectral diagnostic tool for evaluating model robustness. Our analysis indicates that L1 activation regularization yields modest but consistent increases in high-frequency ratios, while synthetic motion blur leads to only minor spectral variations (within ±1%). MASA provides a principled spectral diagnostic framework for quantifying motion artifacts and guiding the design of motion-resilient robot vision systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of machine learning technologies has created significant opportunities to address agricultural challenges, particularly in plant disease detection. Accurate, efficient, and scalable diagnostic methods are essential for effective disease management. This study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach, focusing on three key areas: segmentation, feature extraction, and classification techniques in plant disease detection. The review highlights the increasing adoption of Deep Learning (DL) models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), hybrid approaches, and feature fusion methods, which enhance classification performance and robustness. However, challenges such as limited labeled datasets, high computational demands, and inefficiencies in segmentation persist. The findings underscore the importance of addressing these limitations through advancements in segmentation methods, domain-specific, pre-trained models, and lightweight architectures optimized for real-time applications. Additionally, leveraging semi-supervised learning techniques can utilize unlabeled data to reduce dependency on extensive feature types, improving segmentation accuracy, and developing scalable models to meet the needs of resource-limited settings. By addressing these challenges, the application of machine learning in plant disease detection can achieve higher accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility, significantly benefiting modern agriculture and sustainable farming practices."

    "abstract": "Machining errors, assembly errors and interference factors in the operation of mechanical parts will lead to system errors, which will affect control accuracy and production efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm based on linearization model, and integrates robust design to deal with the nonlinearity, time-varying and uncertainty of the system. The discrete state space model is used to describe the system dynamics, and the rolling time domain optimization strategy is adopted to transform the robust MPC optimization problem into a quadratic programming problem to realize real-time control. At the same time, this paper constructs a comprehensive error decomposition model to decompose the total error into geometric error, thermal error and sensor noise, and uses machine learning algorithm to model and predict the complex error characteristics. The dynamic error compensation is realized by updating the error model parameters online through feedforward compensation and recursive least square method. The simulation results show that the dynamic compensation model is significantly superior to the traditional PID control and static compensation model in terms of the maximum error, root mean square error (RMSE) and control variable volatility, which verifies its adaptability and superiority under complex disturbances. In addition, the dynamic compensation mechanism can effectively suppress the complex interference of time-varying disturbance and random noise, and improve the response speed and stability of the system."

Moving beyond single-metric evaluation, we conducted 10 repeated trials for each controller, analyzing more than ten performance indicators to assess the trade-offs between efficiency, stability, and ride comfort. Efficiency improved under the hybrid PID+Pure Pursuit controller—lap time decreased by 13.5% and average speed increased by 15.0% Cost metrics moved in the opposite direction: steering-rate RMS rose by 11.5% and lateral-acceleration RMS by 31.2%. The smoother trajectory did not translate into comfort because higher velocity amplified lateral forces; meanwhile, longitudinal-jerk RMS showed no meaningful difference (p = 0.923). Overall, the evidence argues against single-metric, errorcentric judgments and motivates a reproducible, data-driven, multimetric validation pipeline before field deployment."

This tracker would not perform its role effectively without an acceptable calculation for the maximum power point (MPP) as its main task.

The level of calculations' precision would differ according to this change from one model to another. This work assesses the precision level for different MPP-calculating neural networks that specifically use weather factors as inputs for Irbid City in Jordan. The results showed that the neural network with the (Air Temperature) only as input is the network with the lowest precision, according to the 0.458 found for the correlation coefficient.

The dataset contains 5,490 labeled pictures of chickens taken from several places, such as pictures from the internet, screenshots from games, and frames from videos. Standard object detection metrics were used to train and test both models in the same computer environment. With a mAP@50 of 0.867, a precision of 0.788, a recall of 0.819, and a fast inference time of 2.3 milliseconds per image, YOLOv11 was very good at finding things. Faster R- CNN had a higher recall rate (0.9135), but a lower precision rate (0.5312) and a slower inference time (80.6 milliseconds per image). These results show the pros and cons of each model, which helps choose the best detection frameworks for real-time intelligent poultry monitoring and future use in larger smart farming applications."

The testing required an identical App built using Dart and Kotlin with the latest version of each respective language and tested on the same emulator (Pixel 6 API 35). Beginner friendliness data will be collected through surveys to fellow developers. Each language has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the projects. Results of the testing reveal that Dart has an advantage in LOC, faster Firebase fetch time, while Kotlin excels in smaller App size, faster build time and a slightly faster performance in uploading data to Firebase. The surveys resulted in more favorable language, Dart for ease of project setup, CRUD deployment and widget usability, while Kotlin is favorable for its code readability and ease of understanding. These findings aim to guide developers in choosing a language based on the project requirements."

    "abstract": "In practice, firms' managers are key decision-makers and are often plagued by optimistic bias. In collaborative innovation, this optimism manifests in both alignment and divergence among parties, which affects the efficiency and stability of collaborative innovation. However, the conditions and mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To explore this issue, we consider a collaborative supply chain in which the supplier and the downstream manufacturer are realistic or optimistic. Our paper demonstrates the positive promotion of managerial optimism in innovation and shows that optimistic managers can innovate even when the profit in the supply chain is negative. Moreover, aligned optimism allows the supplier to shift the burden of innovation and cost to the manufacturer, increasing the manufacturer's innovation level. However, compared to aligned optimism, divergent optimism can lead to win-win outcomes under certain conditions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that when the optimism bias in consumer innovation preference is high, the supplier should choose a collaborator with an aligned attitude. Similarly, when the bias is moderate, the manufacturer should make the same choice. In both cases, aligned attitudes help synchronize decisions, which can benefit both firms due to higher innovation levels and reasonable prices."

    "abstract": "In the context of multi-view clustering, graph learning is recognized as a crucial technique, which generally involves constructing an adaptive neighbor graph based on probabilistic neighbors, and then learning a consensus graph for clustering. However, it is worth noting that these graph learning methods encounter two significant limitations. Firstly, they often rely on Euclidean distance to measure similarity when constructing the adaptive neighbor graph, which proves inadequate in capturing the intrinsic structure among data points in practice, particularly for high-dimensional data. Secondly, most of these methods focus solely on consensus graph, ignoring unique information from each view. Although a few graph-based studies have considered using specific information as well, the modelling approach employed does not exclude the noise impact from the common or specific components. To this end, we propose a novel tensor-based multi-view graph learning framework that simultaneously considers consistency and specificity, while effectively eliminating the influence of noise. Specifically, we calculate similarity using pseudo-Stiefel manifold distance to preserve the intrinsic properties of data. By making an assumption that the learned neighbor graph of each view comprises a consistent part, a specific part, and a noise part, we formulate a new tensor-based target graph learning paradigm for noise-free graph fusion. Owing to the benefits of tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) in uncovering high-order correlations, this model is capable of achieving a comprehensive understanding of the target graph. Furthermore, we derive an algorithm to address the optimization problem. Experiments on six datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

First, the architecture design of the meta-computing framework is proposed based on sensor data. Secondly, a computer vision-based target detection algorithm is developed as the first stage, and a trajectory tracking algorithm is developed as the second stage. The combination of these two constitutes a meta-computing visual cognition framework for intelligent feeding methods in the research scenario. In terms of empirical research, we conducted experimental evaluations in a real IRAS supported by multi-sensor meta-computing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent feeding method effectively reduces feed residue, enhances feed conversion rates, and shortens water quality control time. It also strengthens the safety and autonomy of decision-making in IRAS."

This paper presents a general and programmable analog computational circuit for solving CMEs to address this. It simultaneously solves all unknown matrices in the CMEs with microsecond-level computation speed and requires only a single-step solution without iteration. It also supports solving any type of CMEs without redesigning the circuit structure. Pspice simulation results show that the average accuracy of the proposed circuit exceeds 98%. The final application validation in the stability determination of Markov jump systems (MJSs) demonstrates that the proposed circuit provides a two orders of magnitude speed advantage."

Within this scope of definition, we present a comprehensive review of current Speech LLMs, analyzing their architectures through a three-stage abstraction: Modality Feature Extraction, Modality Information Fusion, and LLM Inference. In addition, we examine training strategies, discuss representative datasets, and review evaluation methodologies adopted in the field. Based on empirical analyses and experimental evidence, we identify two key challenges currently facing Speech LLMs-instruction sensitivity and degradation in semantic reasoning-and propose concrete directions for addressing these issues. Through this systematic and detailed survey, we aim to offer a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners working toward more robust, generalizable, and human-aligned Speech LLMs."

    "abstract": "Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD."

It serves as a potential platform of mode division multiplexing and fiber sensing with special functionalities. A PANDA-type FMF, featuring strong linear birefringence while also supporting higher-order modes, has proven effective in stabilizing the intensity distribution of these modes by breaking the inherent degeneracy in the LP modes of circular-core FMFs. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the characterization of various intra- and intermodal Brillouin gain spectra (BGS) in a PANDA-type FMF, with a particular focus on the measurement of strain and temperature dependence. Brillouin optical correlation-domain analysis with differential measurement is employed to analyze the multipeak BGS of higher-order intramodal Brillouin scattering in a distributed manner, and a far-field detection scheme is implemented to distinctly analyze the Brillouin gain in higher-order modes, despite significant mixing with the fundamental mode."

The coupling voltages on the UAV's GPS antenna, datalink antenna, and typical cables under UWB EMP exposure are obtained through simulation. The effects of different radiation parameters on UAVs are evaluated via UWB EMP irradiation experiments. Results indicate that UWB EMP primarily enters the UAV through back-door coupling, inducing high voltages on the internal cables—particularly those between the electronic speed controller and the rotor motors. The high voltages and overheating will lead to <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">mosfet</small> breakdown and burnout of the motor's copper windings. Additionally, UWB EMP irradiation can cause abnormalities in the inertial measurement unit, resulting in UAV crashes. In contrast, front-door coupling effects mainly manifest as temporary interference like image distortion and datalink interruption. Finally, electromagnetic protection measures are applied to the back-door pathways of the UAV, and their effectiveness is validated."

The combination of low-frequency-optimized sensing and array-level inference yields a compact, passive, and electro-magnetic interference immune platform for weak-signal detection and trajectory tracking, providing practical support for online monitoring and decision-making in industrial environments."

Recently, the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) in VLC systems has provided enhanced network performance thanks to their ability of reflecting the impinging optical intensity to a desired destination, in order to avoid any blockages that may occur in Line of Sight (LoS) links. Taking into account the advantages of RIS deployment in VLC systems, in this paper we present a RIS-aided multi-user communication technique based on a fair RIS partitioning allocation policy (namely, RPMU). The proposed approach is applied in a hybrid RF/VLC indoor system, where asymmetric connectivity links are provided by means of RF uplink and VLC/RIS-aided downlinks. We also present a MAC protocol to support multi-user asymmetric RF/VLC and RIS-aided communications, and investigate packet collision events occurring in the RF uplink. Derivations of the achievable downlink throughput are provided, and the assessment of the proposed RPMU approach is carried out through numerical results showing the achievement of high data rates especially for higher number of RIS elements."

However, conventional multi-channel designs face critical security vulnerabilities for sensitive information due to insufficient encryption mechanisms. In this work, we propose a four-channel phase-change metasurface featuring algorithm-physical co-security—a dual-protection framework combining intrinsic metasurface physical security with chaotic encryption. Our polarization-multiplexed metasurface generates four optical imaging channels through meta-atom design, including two far-field holograms and two near-field patterns. To enhance system security, we apply Chen hyperchaotic encryption combined with the Logistic map and DNA encoding to convert near-field information into secure QR codes; far-field holograms are retained to demonstrate the metasurface's information capacity and for attack detection. The phase-change metasurface further provides physical-layer security through its reconfigurable capability, dynamically controlling imaging channels via reversible crystalline-to-amorphous state transitions. This reconfigurability enhances anti-counterfeiting and reliability while demonstrating the physical security mechanism. The proposed metasurface achieves high-fidelity imaging, robust anti-attack performance, and independent channel control. This integrated approach pioneers a secure paradigm for high-density optical information processing."

    "abstract": "Cell tracking is crucial for understanding the complex patterns of cellular migration that underlie many physiological, pathological, and therapeutic processes. Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) is a method that uses list-mode positron emission tomography (PET) data to localize moving particles non-invasively inside opaque systems. However, while the application of this method to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> cell tracking has previously been evoked, its implementation has been limited to tracking one cell at a time. This study investigates the feasibility of tracking multiple cells simultaneously using a recently developed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm called PEPT-EM. The primary challenge to the translation of this algorithm towards biomedical applications is the low radioactivity of the cells being tracked. We experimentally demonstrated the performance of the PEPT-EM algorithm using a preclinical PET scanner for tracking droplets and cells with activities ranging from tens to hundreds of Bq, in phantoms and in a murine model. We found that while background and multiplexing effects impact static source tracking, sensitivity is critical for dynamic tracking of moving sources. We successfully localized multiple single cells in a murine model, moving at speeds up to 25 mm/s, marking the first use of PEPT-EM for such applications. Our findings highlight the exciting potential of PEPT for real-time, high throughput tracking of multiple single cells <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>, paving the way for studying cell tracking in biological systems."

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of renewable energy sources has introduced new challenges in the management and stability of power grids. Among these sources, wind energy is one of the fastest-growing, standing out with its environmental benefits and limitless potential. However, the natural fluctuations in the energy generation characteristics of wind turbines can lead to stability issues in electrical grids. This paper examines the impact of wind turbine distribution transformers on grid stability. The irregularities in the output power of wind turbines can cause problems such as voltage regulation, reactive power balance, harmonic distortions, and frequency fluctuations during transmission to the grid. Distribution transformers play a critical role in mitigating these effects and ensuring grid stability. The study analyzes the control strategies and protection systems of distribution transformers in the context of wind energy systems’ impact on the grid. Both theoretical and simulation-based analyses are presented, and the behavior of transformers under different scenarios is examined. Additionally, the potential use of energy storage systems and modern power electronics devices to enhance grid stability is discussed. In conclusion, the effective design and management of wind turbine distribution transformers are crucial for the successful integration of renewable energy and the development of sustainable energy systems. This study aims to serve as a guide for future research in the fields of energy engineering and grid stabilization."

SAS-L2 does not require the implementation of hash functions on resource- constrained IoT devices and can perform authentication processing using only exclusive OR (XOR) and addition operations.

In comparison to Residual U-Net, which achieved 98.36% accuracy, a Dice Coefficient of 50.04%, and a Mean IoU of 37.55%, Vanilla U-Net achieved 99.37% accuracy, a global Dice Coefficient of 65.51%, and a Mean IoU of 81.37%.

Piloted in Jakarta and East Java, the solution reflects a scalable, standards-based model aligned with national priorities.

The proposed architecture spans point-of-service, regional, and national levels and includes registry services, business services, and interoperability layers. Design activities involve iterative modeling, prototyping, and scenario-based testing in a controlled environment. The resulting artifact offers a replicable model for HIE advancement in low- and middle-income countries."

    "abstract": "RzkFL is an end-to-end, privacy-preserving machine-learning framework that fuses Federated Learning (FL) with recursive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to protect data, models, and users while unlocking verifiable inference. Models are trained entirely on local devices, so sensitive data never leave the premises. The resulting model can be monetized by offering verifiable predictions on a pay-per-use basis. During inference, each customer independently computes predictions using private data, making it essential to verify that these inference results are computed correctly and honestly. Unlike existing approaches that rely on heavy communication or centralized trust assumptions, RzkFL allows each customer to generate a cryptographic proof of correct local inference, which can be succinctly verified without revealing input data or model parameters either by the customer or a third party. The core innovation lies in the use of recursive ZKPs, enabling each customer to generate small, composable proofs for intermediate layers of neural network inference. These proofs are then recursively aggregated into a single succinct proof using the Nova proof folding scheme. Nova’s design eliminates the traditional sequential dependency of recursive proofs by enabling incrementally verifiable computation through a folding scheme. RzkFL supports on-chain verification via Ethereum smart contracts, allowing AI results to flow directly into financial workflows. A decentralized file storage system maintains the integrity and availability of the global model. We introduce specialized circuits for input, hidden, and output layers to optimize proof generation time and gas costs. The customer can generate proof for the entire inference computation or delegate the proof generation for the intermediate layers and the output layer to another party. The design suits privacy-preserving machine learning scenarios where customer devices are resource-constrained. Our results show that RzkFL can significantly reduce proof size and verification costs while maintaining privacy, integrity, and scalability in federated inference. This makes it a compelling approach for real-world decentralized AI systems requiring strong verifiability guarantees."

This paper begins by highlighting the significance of optimizing building designs for energy efficiency and identifies the limitations and challenges present in traditional design approaches. Subsequently, this paper expounds the application of genetic algorithm (GA) in the optimization design of building energy efficiency, including its effectiveness in multi-objective optimization problems and its advantages in optimizing building design parameters. In this paper, a GA-based optimal design process for building energy efficiency is proposed, which includes three stages: preliminary design, detailed design and optimal design, and describes the eight steps of the design process and method in detail. In addition, this paper also introduces the use of artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict energy consumption, and uses GA to optimize the parameters of ANN model to improve the prediction accuracy. By examining buildings in three distinct thermal zones across different cities, this study validates the effectiveness of the building energy-saving optimization design process and method utilizing GA. It also assesses the precision of the ANN model, refined through this optimization, in forecasting energy consumption. Findings indicate that employing GA for optimizing building energy efficiency can significantly lower annual energy use. Moreover, the improved ANN model demonstrates a high level of accuracy in predicting building energy consumption, thereby offering robust technical support for both the design and retrofitting of buildings aimed at enhancing energy efficiency."

    "abstract": "Industrial vibration monitoring is essential for equipment health assessment; however, contact-based sensors are unsuitable in hazardous environments, while existing contactless methods suffer from accuracy degradation due to angular misalignment and range limitations. This paper proposes a joint estimation approach for direction-of-arrival (DoA) and vibration frequency in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-antenna contactless measurement scenarios. The system integrates an 8×1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) array with a software-defined radio (SDR) platform. A differential method is employed to extract inter-antenna phase differences for DoA estimation using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Based on the estimated DoA, passive and active angle-aware methods are developed for vibration frequency estimation with passive or active DoA compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves robust DoA and vibration frequency estimation under directional deviations and extended ranges, highlighting its potential for industrial fault detection and preventive maintenance."

Subsequently, six mainstreams deep learning based object detection algorithms are tested on this dataset, and the basic detection results of these detectors are obtained. To further enhance the detection performance, we improved the YOLOv8 algorithm with the best performance by integrating two types of feature pyramids into it. After the improvement, it can be clearly seen that the detection effect has been enhanced. Finally, this paper elaborates on how to combine the object detector and the object tracker to construct a complete system."

The proposed approach accurately satisfies the boundary conditions without requiring additional approximations at the boundaries and is easy to implement.

    "abstract": "Urban policing faces growing challenges in anticipating and mitigating crime amidst dynamic, resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces an agentic AI framework that integrates deep spatio-temporal forecasting with adaptive patrol planning to support proactive public safety strategies. Leveraging over 15 years of crime data from the Seattle Police Department, we train and compare multiple deep learning architectures—including LSTM, GRU, and 1D CNN models—to predict short-term spatial distributions of crime risk. The agentic layer transforms these predictions into autonomous decisions using reinforcement-inspired routing algorithms and a feedback module that refines the predictive model based on observed outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that GRU-based predictors strike the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, while the agent's adaptive planning improves coverage in high-risk zones. We also implement fairness-aware mechanisms to reduce bias in over-policed communities. This study offers one of the first fully integrated frameworks for real-time crime forecasting and patrol decision-making, setting the stage for aligned, adaptive, and ethically responsible AI in law enforcement."

Traditional scheduling methods often have problems such as large computational volume and poor adaptability when facing complex production environments. Machine learning technology shows great potential in the field of intelligent scheduling to achieve efficient and intelligent scheduling optimization through data-driven methods. In this paper, we study the intelligent scheduling optimization algorithm of mechatronics assembly line based on machine learning method. The key factors of the assembly line scheduling problem are analyzed, and the limitations of traditional scheduling methods are discussed. The intelligent scheduling optimization model based on machine learning is constructed, including data feature extraction, model selection and optimization, and the design of intelligent scheduling algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through experiments, and a comparative analysis is conducted with the traditional method to evaluate its optimization effect in terms of scheduling efficiency, resource utilization and production stability. The results show that the scheduling optimization method based on machine learning can significantly improve the scheduling efficiency of the assembly line, which provides new ideas and technical support for production scheduling in the intelligent manufacturing environment."

    "abstract": "Among the various types of sensors that detect the rotation angle in automobile parts, the Hall Sensor (HALL Sensor) is a widely used technology in sensor applications. The rotation angle of a Hall sensor is currently accurate because it detects a precise angle within an error range of less than 1%. However, since the Hall sensor may be affected by the disturbance of the external magnet, the accuracy of the sensor is degraded due to the interaction between the magnetic field of the internal magnet and the magnetic field of the external magnet. To improve this, we try to find a shielding method that shields the external magnetic field using magnetic materials and a method that improves the measurement stability of the Hall sensor by analyzing the magnetic field phenomenon that passes through the magnetic material. In this paper, we present our experimental results to digitize the degree of external magnetic field shielding to secure stability and to maintain the accuracy of the sensor (the disturbance characteristics of the external magnet) below 5%."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a tree hidden danger prediction method for transmission lines is proposed, which combines spatio-temporal data modeling and reinforcement learning (RL) optimization. First of all, by fusing multi-source data such as the spatial distribution of transmission lines, the growth characteristics of trees and meteorological conditions, a prediction model that can reflect the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics is constructed. The model uses the Spatiotemporal graph convolution network (ST-GCN) to deal with the spatial characteristics, simulates the growth rate of trees by combining the dynamic equation of tree growth, and introduces the spatio-temporal attention mechanism to evaluate the potential risks caused by trees. Secondly, an RL optimization framework based on markov decision processes (MDP) is designed, and the model parameters are dynamically adjusted by using DDPG algorithm with double delays to improve the prediction accuracy and real-time. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall, F1 value, mean absolute error (MAE) and time-consuming of single prediction, especially in extreme weather conditions such as strong wind, which verifies the superiority and application prospect of this method in tree hidden danger prediction of transmission lines."

Understanding co-designers' experience designing can help improve co-design processes and their outcomes. However, there is currently a lack of established tools for evaluating participatory design processes, especially from the perspective of co-designers. Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), which engages partners as researchers throughout a project, offers validated tools for evaluating partnerships. While CBPR and co-design both aim to actively engage partners throughout a project, limited work has explored how CBPR evaluation tools might apply to co-design. In this methodological paper, we present a CBPR-informed survey developed to evaluate co-designers' experiences. We piloted the survey with community members in Ethiopia and Kenya engaged in designing family planning interventions. Here, we present the survey we developed and share our learnings on how utilizing a CBPR-informed approach to understand co-designers' experiences can provide deeper insight into how co-design processes impact those who participate."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications poses significant challenges for radar signal processing, demanding both high-precision feature extraction and real-time processing capabilities. Traditional methods, constrained by linear processing frameworks, struggle to balance noise suppression and micro-Doppler feature preservation. While time-frequency analysis offers richer signal details, its computational burden hinders real-time performance. Recent deep learning approaches, although enhancing feature representation, rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets and complex network architectures. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel physics-driven high-dimensional space mapping method. Non-linear Dimension Expansion (NDE) enhances target-clutter separability, a One-Hot encoding mechanism forms a sparse feature matrix to reduce computational complexity, and an adaptive sparse modulation factor dynamically adjusts feature space resolution, optimizing features in the preprocessing stage. Compared to traditional methods, this approach eliminates the need for subsequent detection algorithm compensation, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The method offers a promising solution for low-altitude UAV radar signal processing by providing enhanced feature separability and reduced computational cost."

    "abstract": "Electricity access in rural sub-Saharan Africa re-mains a significant challenge. Settlement patterns in this region exhibit considerable heterogeneity, significantly impacting distri-bution network layouts and investment costs. This paper analyzes settlement patterns within communities using a network design model that minimizes transformer count and aggregate costs of LV and intra-community MV infrastructure. The optimization results provide key network metrics for each community, including transformer counts, low-voltage wire, and internal medium-voltage wire requirements per connection. This model builds upon an established two-level network design algorithm while incorporating significant computational improvements. Tests show a two orders of magnitude reduction in computational time by relaxing the voltage drop constraint while maintaining exceptional fidelity in distribution infrastructure cost per connection. Meanwhile, the maximum input size of connection nodes that can be computed is nearly three to four times larger, reducing boundary effects. Additionally, a geospatial outlier exclusion methodology prevents community cost metrics from being distorted by spatially distant connection nodes. These improvements enable the algorithm to be applied to large-scale networks with less time, reduced segmentation requirements, and smaller effects of geospatial outliers. These enhancements allow planners to identify prioritized electrification communities and allocate resources strategically across diverse settlement patterns."

    "abstract": "In modern society, with the diversification of people's entertainment life and the rapid development of technology, the application scope of three-dimensional (3D) animated game characters in the gaming industry is constantly expanding, and their influence is deepening. In this context, it is particularly important to use deep learning (DL) technology to promote the development of the 3D animation game character industry. The generation of game character behavior, as a core part of 3D animation production, relies on real motion data obtained through motion capture and other means, combined with advanced computer technology, to achieve the realistic reproduction of character behavior. This complex process not only requires high technical precision, but also requires comprehensive consideration of multiple dimensions such as the character's action characteristics and scene environment. To address this challenge, this article innovatively proposes a DL based 3D animation game character behavior generation and optimization algorithm. This algorithm can intelligently process and analyze character action data through training and fine optimization of DL models, thereby generating more natural, smooth, and game scene fitting 3D character behaviors. The experimental data fully demonstrates that the algorithm performs excellently in improving the efficiency and quality of character behavior generation."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of AI, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) for major appliances such as air conditioners has become a critical technology. However, data distribution shifts, driven by new product releases or market expansions, degrade the performance of existing AI models, leading to substantial retraining costs. Continual Learning (CL) is a promising solution to this problem, yet most research has focused on image classification, leaving its application to time-series data from appliance operations largely underexplored. This paper proposes a Transformer encoder-based CL framework for predicting refrigerant deficiency by effectively learning from large-scale air conditioner time-series data streamed sequentially by year and country. We systematically evaluated key CL methodologies—regularization, replay, and hybrid approaches—on real-world operational data. Experimental results demonstrate that replay-based methods successfully mitigate catastrophic forgetting by preserving past knowledge. Notably, a hybrid model combining a replay strategy with Less-Forgetting Learning (LFL) achieved the highest predictive performance. This study suggests that CL presents an efficient and scalable solution for continuously evolving a single PdM model, eliminating the need for periodic retraining in dynamic data environments."

The implementation of AI in the industry can increase innovation and efficiency in various business processes. Generation Z as the digital generation, having characteristics that are very adaptable to the work environment, especially those based on AI. Although AI is considered to improve performance productivity, there is still a gap in how AI can improve job satisfaction. This study investigates the influence of AI adoption variables on employee productivity and job satisfaction in Gen Z employees in Indonesia's creative industry. This research uses a quantitative method with research instruments in the form of an online survey of 200 samples. The SEM-PLS technique was used to analyze the data. Researchers found that AI adoption has a significant positive influence on employee productivity and job satisfaction. In addition, researchers also found that job satisfaction has a positive effect on employee productivity by strengthening a balanced AI integration strategy. However, the indirect impact on the relationship between AI adoption on employee productivity through job satisfaction was found to have no significant effect. These findings lead researchers to recommend to organizations that in addition to adopting AI, they also need to consider employee well-being so that the benefits obtained can be optimal. This study provides insights for companies in creating AI-based strategies to manage a sustainable Gen Z work environment in the digital age."

In this paper, we propose DDGWD, a pruning method that simultaneously incorporates filter importance and redundancy evaluation based on Manhattan distance. Experiments on a tooth segmentation dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces computational cost and memory usage compared to conventional importance-based approaches while minimizing performance degradation. This study shows that redundancy-aware pruning can play a crucial role in developing lightweight tooth segmentation models suitable for practical industrial deployment."

Recent science and technological advancements have shown that reducing fossil fuel consumption significantly mitigates environmental degradation and is beneficial to public health. Using renewable energy to power electric vehicles (EVs) instead of gasoline is one strategy to reduce fuel use. One of the primary problems with electric vehicle batteries is that they deteriorate with time, making them unsafe to use. To reduce the threat caused by EV batteries, the evaluation and prediction of battery health has been a primary research objective. This paper suggests data-driven battery degradation modeling based on a battery performance process followed by a very detailed testing protocol to extract important battery characteristics. For electric vehicle (EV) applications, this process offers a useful tool to maximize battery life and enhance safety."

    "abstract": "This study presents the first integration of nanodiamonds (NDs) with a microcavity in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer (μIMZI) fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining in the side surface of an optical fiber. NDs of different sizes form a structured and functional layer for receptor immobilization. Numerical analyses were performed to investigate how the ND particle size influences the optical field distribution in the cavity. The sensor's spectral response and refractive index sensitivity have been investigated experimentally. The results have shown that the ND layer enhanced light-surface interaction and increased the available area for binding, improving surface sensitivity and enhancing receptor loading. Among the tested configurations, the μIMZI modified with a 250 nm-thick ND layer exhibited the most favorable characteristics, achieving RI sensitivity of approximately 15,300 nm/RIU, and was therefore employed for specific, label-free detection of a model low-molecular-weight protein, green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The modified sensor demonstrated monotonic change and reproducible spectral response down to a protein concentration of 0.35 μg/mL, while the limit of detection was equal to 0.14 μg/mL, with a response time of about 30 minutes, which can be further optimized. In contrast, a non-modified reference μIMZI showed no response to comparable concentrations. Besides label-free detection, the multifunctional nature of NDs was further explored by exciting nitrogen-vacancy centers in the diamond structure, aiming for fluorescence-based sensing. These experiments confirmed that, in this configuration, the centers could be optically excited by a light guided through the fiber core, which is partially exposed within the microcavity and can interact directly with the ND-coated surface. The resulting fluorescence was detected from the microcavity region, demonstrating excitation and readout capabilities. Altogether, this work demonstrates that ND-based surface modification can simultaneously enhance sensitivity and expand the functional capabilities of these highly compact optical fiber biosensors."

Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) is a method that uses list-mode positron emission tomography (PET) data to localize moving particles non-invasively inside opaque systems. However, while the application of this method to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> cell tracking has previously been evoked, its implementation has been limited to tracking one cell at a time. This study investigates the feasibility of tracking multiple cells simultaneously using a recently developed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm called PEPT-EM. The primary challenge to the translation of this algorithm towards biomedical applications is the low radioactivity of the cells being tracked. We experimentally demonstrated the performance of the PEPT-EM algorithm using a preclinical PET scanner for tracking droplets and cells with activities ranging from tens to hundreds of Bq, in phantoms and in a murine model. We found that while background and multiplexing effects impact static source tracking, sensitivity is critical for dynamic tracking of moving sources. We successfully localized multiple single cells in a murine model, moving at speeds up to 25 mm/s, marking the first use of PEPT-EM for such applications. Our findings highlight the exciting potential of PEPT for real-time, high throughput tracking of multiple single cells <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>, paving the way for studying cell tracking in biological systems."

This paper presents SW3T-IoT, an innovative water monitoring system leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance water resource management under dynamic conditions. The system adopts a three-tier architecture—edge, fog, and cloud—integrating a custom-designed LoRa-WDS node optimized for low power consumption and long-term autonomous operation. These nodes collect real-time data on water level, flow, pressure, temperature, and quality from distribution networks and reservoirs. Data are locally processed at the edge, then transferred to the cloud for advanced analysis and visualization. A Geographic Information System (GIS) enhances spatial awareness and decision-making. To ensure adaptability, SW3T-IoT integrates a continual learning (CL) framework for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) forecasting. The CL mechanism allows models to incrementally update with new environmental data without catastrophic forgetting, maintaining accuracy and robustness as water quality dynamics evolve. A hybrid CNN–BiLSTM–Attention model, reinforced with PER, AER, LwF, and EWC strategies, supports adaptive prediction and knowledge retention. The system delivers intuitive dashboards for engineers and water managers, providing a holistic, scalable, and intelligent solution for sustainable water resource management."

    "abstract": "This paper examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate sustainable development within smart manufacturing globally, addressing a significant literature gap. While AI clearly plays an important role in operational efficiency, its broader contribution across the manufacturing life cycle remains underexplored. Drawing on 43 expert interviews conducted between June and September 2024, four areas where AI delivers sustainability value are identified: energy optimization, predictive maintenance, sustainable supply chains, and carbon emission management. The robustness of the results is ensured by the Gioia protocol, double coding with adjudication, cross-role and cross-country triangulation, member checking, saturation, and an auditable codebook. First, the findings reveal that many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) experience greater than expected efficiency gains when moving from manual to AI-based energy monitoring, exposing hidden inefficiencies. Second, a strong link between predictive maintenance and energy savings is revealed, suggesting that equipment longevity and sustainability are more tightly coupled than previously recognized. Third, AI-enabled emission tracking serves both as a compliance mechanism and as a catalyst for internal cultural change and stakeholder trust, positioning AI as a strategic governance tool. Finally, policy and managerial recommendations are provided to foster responsible AI adoption in manufacturing. A multilevel conceptual model that illustrates how AI, supported by digital and organizational enablers, contributes to sustainability outcomes and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is also presented. This research advances theory and practice by highlighting the transformative, yet still underleveraged, role of AI in sustainable manufacturing transitions."

The initial 2:1 voltage reduction stage significantly reduces the overall volume/weight of flying capacitors, while the SDIH stage offers reduced component count and an excellent switch stress figure of merit. A preliminary 50 W hardware prototype validates this topology while employing de-rated gallium nitride (GaN) switches to enable operation in harsh environments such as aerospace. Further leveraging topology-specific properties, we also describe the implementation of two highly complimentary circuit blocks; a high density gate drive solution, and a technique termed “resonant charge recovery” (RCR) which serves to reduce overall converter losses by up to 37% while occupying <1% of total converter volume.

    "abstract": "This work investigates a multi-user, multi-antenna uplink wireless system, in which multiple users transmit signals to a base station. Prior research has explored the potential for linear growth in spectral efficiency by employing multiple transmit and receive antennas. This gain depends heavily on the quality of channel state information and the number of uncorrelated antennas. However, spatial correlations, arising from closely-spaced antennas and channel aging effects, stemming from the difference between the channel state at pilot and data time instances, can substantially counteract these benefits, and degrade the transmission rate, especially in non-stationary environments. To address these challenges, this work introduces a real-time beamforming framework to compensate for the spatial correlation and channel aging effects. First, a channel estimation scheme leveraging temporal channel correlations and considering mobile device velocity and antenna spacing is developed. Subsequently, an expression approximating the average spectral efficiency, which depends on pilot spacing, pilot and data powers, and beamforming vectors, is obtained. By maximizing this expression, optimal parameters are identified. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to prior works. Interestingly, the optimal pilot spacing remains unaffected by large-scale channel parameters and the velocities of interfering users. The impact of interference components also diminishes with an increasing number of transmit antennas."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel multi-carrier modulation framework for high-mobility communication scenarios. Our key idea lies in spreading data symbols across the delay-Doppler (DD) domain through orthogonal chirp-Zak transform (CZT). To enable efficient signal multiplexing, the proposed modulation scheme employs a transmitter signal that maintains orthogonality with the inherent resolution characteristics of the DD plane. Termed as Orthogonal Chirp Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (CDDM), we demonstrate a synergistic integration of chirp waveform properties with the channel structure of the DD domain, thereby achieving advantages with both lower computational efficiency and improved detection performance. We introduce a novel CZT-based superimposed sparse pilot structure to enable simultaneous estimation of delay-Doppler shifts and channel coefficients. For enhanced performance, we further develop an embedded pilot scheme that demonstrates channel estimation performance comparable to that of Orthogonal Delay-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ODDM) systems. Simulation results demonstrate that CDDM achieves significant bit error rate (BER) improvements over existing modulation schemes , under perfect channel state information (CSI), as well as superior out-of-band emissions (OOBE). Further, for the imperfect CSI case, the proposed CZT-based superimposed pilot scheme leads to significantly reduced normalized mean square error (NMSE), whilst attaining equivalent estimation accuracy to that of ODDM with lower computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Indoor localization using radio-frequency identification (RFID) has benefited from deep learning, yet models trained in a labeled source environment often degrade when deployed in a different, unlabeled target environment. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to mitigate this distribution shift by aligning a source-trained model with target-domain data. In practice, the source dataset is frequently unavailable at adaptation time due to privacy and resource constraints. This motivates source-free domain adaptation (SFDA); however, most SFDA methods have been developed for classification, and extending them to indoor localization (regression) is challenging, especially when target datasets are small and noisy. Motivated by above limitations, we introduce MTLoc, a source-free mean-teacher approach for indoor localization. MTLoc includes a student and a teacher network: the student network is updated using noisy target data with teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The teacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To further ensure robustness, we propose a correction mechanism in which the teacher’s pseudo-labels are refined using k-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on target data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor environments. Validated using real-world data from our experimental setup with INLAN Inc., our results<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> show that MTLoc achieves high localization accuracy under challenging conditions, significantly reducing distance error compared to baselines. On average, it reduces MAE (d) by 20.0% on Cross and 22.5% on Square datasets. With confidence correction, these improvements reach 23.9% and 28.2% respectively."

However, most existing methods rely on densely sampled transients from large, continuous relay surfaces, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios with aperture constraints. To address this limitation, we propose an unsupervised zero-shot framework tailored for confocal NLOS imaging with aperture-limited relay surfaces. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to recover fully-sampled transients from undersampled versions by enforcing measurement consistency during the sampling process. To further improve recovered transient quality, we introduce a progressive recovery strategy that incrementally recovers missing transient values, effectively mitigating the impact of severe aperture limitations. In addition, to suppress error propagation during recovery, we develop a backpropagation-based error correction reconstruction algorithm that refines intermediate recovered transients by enforcing sparsity regularization in the voxel domain, enabling high-fidelity final reconstructions. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets validate the robustness and generalization capability of our method across diverse aperture-limited relay surfaces. Notably, our method follows a zero-shot paradigm, requiring only a single pretraining stage without paired data or pattern-specific retraining, making it a more practical and generalizable framework for NLOS imaging."

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed in MTSAD to capture spatial features but require predefined and explicit graph structures. Graph Structure Learning (GSL) addresses this limitation by jointly learning the graph structure and downstream tasks. However, existing GSL-based MTSAD methods fail to effectively leverage prior knowledge and struggle with insufficient GNN depth, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a multivariate time series anomaly detection method based on a learnable spatio-temporal graph ordinary differential equation network (STGODE), named MAD-ODE. Our approach leverages hybird graph learning, which includes two types of graph structures: a static similarity graph and a learnable graph. The static similarity graph is constructed using prior knowledge and provides a stable, interpretable representation of sensor dependencies. In contrast, the learnable graph captures complex relationships between sensors by optimizing its structure through backpropagation. This hybird graph learning effectively incorporates both prior knowledge and learned dependencies, ensuring robust and flexible modeling of sensor relationships. Furthermore, we design a STGODE predictor, which operates on both graph structures and employs continuous graph convolutional networks, enabling it to capturing long-range spatio-temporal dependencies for forecasting the next timestamp. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate that MAD-ODE achieves the best average performance and maintains stable results compared to existing methods."

A modular and automated modeling method driven by a real-time topology matrix is first developed, enabling accurate real-time representation of the system’s structure and operating state. Subsequently, a real-time simulation-driven prediction method for relay current settings is introduced, along with an adaptive optimization model that dynamically adjusts the setting according to evaluation indices. The proposed approach is experimentally validated based on real-time electrical data and historical fault records collected from a coal mine power distribution system. Results demonstrate that the DT model established by the proposed method exhibits excellent capability in both dynamically tracking the actual system states and achieving high simulation accuracy, thereby effectively improving relay protection performance and showing strong potential for practical application."

    "abstract": "Solar power is increasingly recognized as a pivotal alternative to mitigate the utilization of limited fossil fuels and their associated pollution. Photovoltaic (PV) power plants contribute substantially to renewable energy generation; however, they face challenges due to the intermittent and volatile nature of solar energy. Addressing these challenges necessitates an automatic and precise forecasting system to efficiently manage and ensure consistency in the electricity power system. Various deep learning-based techniques have been proposed for PV power forecasting, but there is still a pressing need to further reduce the error rates of these methods to effectively manage the grid. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning-based network that combines dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) and residual long short-term memory (RLSTM) techniques. The DCNN is used to extract spatial patterns from historical PV data under varying weather conditions. These patterns are then input into a bidirectional RLSTM network to capture temporal correlations within the data. The output of the DCNN-RLSTM network is then fed into fully connected layers for making predictions. Our proposed model’s performance is evaluated using various benchmarks and four different evaluation metrics: RMSE, MBE, MSE, and MAE. The results show that our model achieves lower error rates compared to previous models. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts in advancing renewable energy technologies for integration into energy systems and buildings. The proposed model uses innovative deep learning techniques to address key aspects of energy planning, management, and operation, ultimately supporting environmental sustainability, energy diversification, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a streaming text-to-speech (TTS) framework for real-time speech synthesis in LLM-driven conversational systems. We extend FastSpeech2, a non-autoregressive model, with block-wise processing that partitions input sequences into fixed-length segments. Block-wise attention masking and buffer-based inference are introduced to preserve prosodic coherence across block boundaries and mitigate training–inference mismatch. Integrated with the HiFi-GAN vocoder, the framework delivers synthesis quality comparable to full-sequence processing while significantly reducing first-block latency (FBL). Experimental results show that block-wise processing maintains audio fidelity under streaming constraints. These findings indicate that feed-forward Transformer architectures can be adapted to streaming synthesis through targeted structural modifications, providing a viable solution for latency-critical LLM–TTS cascade systems."

    "abstract": "Precise estimation of vehicle position and attitude, as well as global ID management, are core challenges for large-scale parking and intelligent transportation infrastructure. This paper defines eight vehicle keypoints that directly describe the vehicle’s pose and BEV (bird’s eye view) coordinates. However, keypoints on glass, roofs, and mirrors, which are not on the road surface, cause a spreading phenomenon during planar homography projection. This occurs because height differences cause the position of the same object to vary across cameras. To address this issue, we propose Anchor-Only BEV Fusion. This technique achieves stable global ID tracking through pre-and post-processing alone, eliminating the need for end-to-end learning. It directly utilizes the YOLOv8 detector, pose estimator, and BoT-SORT tracker. The core approach involves updating the BEV state using only wheel contact points to suppress projection bias, designating the central camera as the ID reference, and using side cameras for auxiliary observations. It also applies gating using slot, field of view (FoV), and velocity constraints, along with Cartesian extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based state estimation. During post-processing, low-quality observations are only used as ID evidence and are not reflected in the state to prevent numerical diffusion. Experiments conducted in Gazebo with 13 cameras demonstrate that this method significantly reduces positional and pose errors, as well as ID switching, compared to existing methods, while achieving near-real-time performance."

This study investigates short-term DO forecasting in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), a highly vulnerable estuarine system in Florida. Using a year-long dataset collected in 2024 from the Kars Park station, we evaluate four forecasting approaches: a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model with least squares optimization, an Adaptive Linear Neuron (Adaline), a recursive deep neural network (DNN Feedback), and a multi-output deep neural network (DNN Multi-Output). Results demonstrate that the DNN Multi-Output substantially outperforms classical and recursive models, reducing mean absolute error by over 80 % compared to FIR and more than 90 % relative to Adaline. Unlike recursive methods, which suffer from error accumulation, the multi-output architecture maintains stable accuracy across horizons up to 24 hours. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for real-time hypoxia forecasting and early warning management in coastal ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the motion model of the spiral structure based on the finite difference method and variable step search, and to analyse the application of the spiral structure through the Archimedean solenoidal equation as a basis. Firstly, for the motion process of the spiral structure, the finite difference method is used to solve the motion positions and velocities of its head, knuckle body and the tail handle of the spiral structure. Secondly, considering the possible collision during the disc entry process, the state of each moment is judged by constructing a rectangular region to determine the termination moment. Further, the study adopts the bifurcation method to search the pitch to ensure that the spiral structure reaches the turnaround region smoothly, and then calculates the minimum pitch and constructs the turnaround path. Finally, in order to optimise the travel speed, this study uses a variable step size search method under constraints to derive the maximum travel speed of the head of the spiral structure. Through this study, an effective model is proposed, which not only provides a new perspective for the scientific analysis of spiral motion, but also lays the foundation for the application in related fields."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving impressive performance across a wide range of linguistic tasks. However, these successes often mask a critical limitation: Current evaluation paradigms provide little insight into how well LLMs handle linguistic abstractions, the very cognitive capability that underlies generalization, analogy-making, and systematic reasoning. Without a principled framework for evaluating abstraction, it remains unclear whether LLMs truly engage in abstractions and their nature, how consistently they do so, and to what extent these behaviors reflect genuine abstraction capabilities versus surface-level pattern matching. We propose a structured taxonomy of linguistic abstractions in natural language processing, spanning levels from morphology to knowledge graphs (KGs), organized along two key dimensions: linguistic granularity and contextual dependence. This taxonomy supports a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs’ abstraction capability and helps identify where current models fall short. In particular, we highlight the limitations of LLMs at higher levels of abstraction—such as semantic, topical, taxonomic, and KG levels—where relational composition, context sensitivity, and symbolic structures are critical. To remedy these weaknesses, we advocate for the integration of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems that combine neural representations with symbolic reasoning."

Lane departure is determined using the YOLOPv2 deep learning model combined with post-processing techniques, while driver drowsiness is assessed by employing Dlib-Based facial landmark detection in conjunction with the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) method. The results from both detection modules are integrated through the main processing unit, which comprehensively evaluates the driver’s drowsiness state and lane departure status. When a risk is identified, the Arduino activates the buzzer and LED to deliver immediate alerts to the driver. The system operates in real time (≈60 FPS) and is designed to enhance driving safety by mitigating risks associated with drowsiness and unintended lane departure."

The data were collected through questionnaires with methods and questions using ECM variable confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continuance intention, with 210 QRIS users (customers) and 8 QRIS users (business owners) analyzed through the SmartPLS 4.0 framework. The conclusion is that confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction have positive and significant effects on continuance intention and continuance intention using QRIS among QRIS users and business owners. The use of QRIS as a payment method in MSEs will not only increase income but also reduce the likelihood of someone failing to purchase because QRIS is not available as a payment option."

This paper outlines the initiative for the development of a low-cost, point-of-care screening tool to increase early detection; the implementation of targeted medical education initiatives to bolster provider knowledge; the distribution of culturally adapted educational materials to enhance community awareness; the creation of nationally recognized supplemental guidelines and a standard operating procedure (SOP) to unify SCD care protocols; and the launch of a robust data collection framework to support evidence-based policy and health system planning. Through interdisciplinary collaboration, global partnerships, and ongoing feedback from Sierra Leonean healthcare professionals and advocacy groups, the SicklED strategy aims to catalyze systemic change and provide a replicable model for addressing noncommunicable diseases in resource-limited settings."

Wi-Fi fingerprint location has attracted much attention because of its low hardware cost and convenient deployment. However, Wi-Fi signals are easily affected by the environment and fluctuate, which leads to the selection of inappropriate reference points. In order to solve this problem, we adopt an adaptive K nearest neighbor algorithm with weighted Euclidean distance. The algorithm optimizes the traditional weighted K nearest neighbor algorithm (WKNN), gives different weights by distinguishing the signal stability of different AP, and calculates the weighted Euclidean distance, and then sets a threshold for the weighted Euclidean distance to get the appropriate K value. The experimental results show that the algorithm adopted in this paper shows higher accuracy than several traditional positioning algorithms."

By analyzing the dynamic impacts of key parameters such as taxiway location and takeoff/landing ratios on runway service time, the feasibility of optimized layouts was validated through Visual C++ and MATLAB simulations. The results demonstrate that: reasonable taxiway layout can significantly reduce aircraft runway exit time; when taxiways are dynamically aligned with aircraft landing roll endpoints, runway occupancy time is markedly decreased and mixed-operation capacity reaches its peak; dynamic scheduling strategies effectively mitigate operational disruptions caused by control delays and taxi speed fluctuations, thereby enhancing model adaptability. The theoretical models show high consistency with simulation results. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between environmental factors and dynamic scheduling strategies significantly improves model robustness. This method not only provides quantitative decision-making support for infrastructure planning in small and medium-sized airports, but can also be extended to real-time scheduling optimization in high-density training scenarios, demonstrating significant engineering application value."

However, resource-constrained edge devices often suffer from limited memory budget and computational resources. To run the modern object detectors with extremely huge computational complexities and costs on such constrained hardware devices, model optimization techniques have been necessarily applied. In this paper, we propose a set of hardware-oriented DNN models optimization techniques, including model operations optimization, model fusion, and layer-wise hardware-friendly integer quantization for object detectors, especially YOLO-based models, to run on these edge devices. Our methods focus on simplifying the model’s hardware-inefficient operations and quantizing the models into an 8-bit integer. Additionally, we apply our techniques to optimize the YOLOv10n model as a case study and implement it on an FPGA-based system. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed approach considerably reduces model size and memory consumption over the baseline, while still achieving an acceptable object detection accuracy. Optimized YOLOv10n achieves approximately a two times reduction in terms of model size, and a four times reduction in terms of peak activation memory, with only 1.90% mAP drop compared to the hardware-friendly model and 3.10% compared to the baseline model, while maintaining competitive performance with ONNX Runtime, OpenVINO, and TensorRT."

This study presents the development and preliminary evaluation of a prototype crop detection system that integrates a deep learning-based Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model with a compact, low-cost consumer drone, tested under controlled indoor conditions. The system utilizes a monocular camera-equipped UAV to perform real-time object detection of common fruits such as apples and oranges, with image processing handled by an edge device. Experimental results under controlled indoor conditions demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves classification scores exceeding 0.85 at close range (approximately 30 cm), despite inherent limitations in sensor quality and computational resources.

    "abstract": "Real-world assets (RWAs) like buildings, equipment, and financial contracts are now being turned into digital tokens so they can be more easily bought, sold, or shared. But most pricing methods for these tokens are fixed or manually set, which makes it hard to keep up with market changes or operational shifts inside a business. This paper presents a reinforcement learning model that learns how to adjust RWA token prices over time based on market activity and internal company data. The system can use input from SAP ERP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing - Enterprise Resource Planning) systems-such as usage history, condition reports, or accounting data-and return pricing decisions that aim to increase participation, keep prices steady, and avoid large swings. These decisions can help enterprise teams make better calls around leasing, investing, or selling assets. The result is a system that connects traditional business software with new digital asset markets in a practical, intelligent way."

    "abstract": "Geological exploration is the key link of mineral resources evaluation, but it faces the challenge of complex geological conditions and massive data. This paper discusses the application of geological exploration data visualization and image processing algorithm in mineral resources evaluation, aiming at improving exploration efficiency and accuracy of resource evaluation. By analyzing the characteristics and processing requirements of geological exploration data and combining the principles and methods of data visualization and image processing algorithms, a set of comprehensive solutions is put forward. It is pointed out that the visualization technology of geological exploration data includes 3D dynamic fine modeling of geological bodies and parallel visualization of attribute field data based on CUDA+GPU cluster, which can visually display the spatial distribution and internal structure of geological bodies. The image processing algorithm extracts mineral composition, texture characteristics and other information from core photos and thin slice microscopic images through denoising, enhancement and segmentation. Taking a copper mine as an example, a 3D geological model is constructed by integrating multi-source exploration data, and the mineral resources are quantitatively evaluated by geostatistics method combined with the image processing results. The results show that this method can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of mineral resources evaluation, and provide new technical means and ideas for geological exploration and mineral resources development."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the operation challenges faced by county distribution network under the background of distributed energy access and diversified load demand, this paper puts forward a typical operation mode modeling and simulation analysis method for multi-party resource interaction. Firstly, the five-in-one interactive architecture of “source-network-load-storage-market” is constructed, which integrates key elements such as distributed power supply, flexible load, energy storage system and market transaction, and realizes the collaborative optimization of physical layer, information layer, market layer and control layer through layered and block method. Secondly, based on multi-agent modeling, resource aggregation model and interactive mechanism, the physical model of distribution network, distributed generation model, load aggregation model and electric vehicle (EV) aggregation model are established, and the market transaction module and collaborative optimization model with double auction mechanism are adopted. Power flow calculation, dynamic simulation and optimization analysis are carried out for different typical scenarios. The results show that at high permeability, the peak photovoltaic output will lead to voltage increase, and the centralized charging of EV will increase the power loss at late peak, while the distributed trading mechanism can significantly improve the photovoltaic absorption rate and reduce the operating cost, but it will increase the voltage fluctuation. In addition, through extreme scenario analysis and electricity price sensitivity analysis, the effectiveness of the model in dealing with faults and stimulating demand response is further verified."

We present a framework for assessing statistical implausibility in LLM security evaluation results using binomial probability analysis, framework-specific variance assessment, and baseline comparison checks. Our analysis of 796 vulnerability detection samples across four recent LLMs suggests performance patterns that warrant methodological examination. Perfect accuracy claims on specific frameworks fall below conventional significance thresholds under realistic expert baselines, which we interpret as possible evaluation inconsistencies rather than clear evidence of capability differences. Furthermore, baseline comparisons showing large improvement factors may reflect evaluation environment differences more than underlying capability. Our statistical validation framework aims to help practitioners assess evaluation reliability when considering deployment in security-critical applications."

    "abstract": "Flood disasters are natural events that frequently occur and have severe impacts, particularly in coastal regions. This study is motivated by the limited research linking lunar cycle phenomena with coastal flooding and the pressing need to develop sequential prediction models for disaster mitigation. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to identify the influence of lunar phase and lunar distance on the occurrence of floods in the coastal areas of Yogyakarta Province; and also, to construct a flood prediction model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) that incorporates climatic factors, tidal coefficient, and lunar cycles. Data were sourced from BMKG, BNPB, and PasangLaut for the period January 2010 to December 2024. The findings reveal that flood risk escalates notably during full and new moon phases and when the moon approaches Earth, contributing to higher tidal coefficients. A Bi-LSTM model was developed by integrating these lunar parameters and optimized through Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, yielding a test accuracy of 95% and a ROC-AUC score of 0.96. Further evaluation using K-Fold cross-validation produced an average accuracy of 94%, with balanced performance demonstrated by a precision of 72%, recall of 75%, and F1-score of 73% on test data. Overall, this study elucidates the complex role of lunar factors in flood events and demonstrates that the proposed model can effectively support early warning systems and disaster management by providing accurate predictions to inform decision-making in coastal areas."

Accurately predicting line losses is crucial for rational allocation of power resources, reducing energy consumption, and improving the overall efficiency of the power grid. Given its criticality, using cutting-edge algorithms to accurately predict distribution line losses has become a focus of current research. This article aims to explore the potential application of neural network technology in theoretical line loss calculation of distribution networks, and innovatively propose a prediction model based on deep learning (DL) to meet the practical needs of energy conservation and loss reduction. This model relies on the excellent nonlinear fitting and feature learning capabilities of DL technology to deeply mine and analyze complex distribution network data, striving to achieve accurate estimation of line loss values. Experimental data shows that compared with traditional methods, this model has achieved significant improvement in prediction accuracy, effectively reducing prediction errors and providing more solid data support for the formulation of energy-saving and loss reduction strategies for distribution networks."

    "abstract": "As a global issue, school bullying has garnered sustained attention from various countries due to its high frequency and severe harm, highlighting the increasing necessity of preventive education. Based on current situation analysis, existing educational approaches—such as theoretical instruction, video-based learning, and game-based education—exhibit limitations including weak interactivity and a lack of real-time feedback for students. Therefore, it is imperative to explore more engaging and effective educational methods. With the advancement of the digital era, mobile learning via smartphone applications has emerged as a viable educational tool. However, it also faces challenges such as students’ lack of concentration. To address this issue, many mobile educational applications have incorporated gamification elements to stimulate students’ continuous engagement. This study focuses on gamification design strategies for a school bullying prevention app targeted at elementary school students. Integrating the CUBI User Experience Model and the DMC (Decomposition of Motivational Characteristics) Gamification Model, and based on the cognitive level of young learners, the research develops design strategies for the app from perspectives including user goals, interaction, business goals, and content. It aims to provide a reference for the development of such applications in the future."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a resource-efficient architecture for capacitive touch sensing based on multi-tone excitation, compressive sensing, and sparse signal reconstruction using the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). Conventional systems that rely on multiple analog front-end (AFE) and ADCs with high-rate uniform sampling, the proposed method employs fewer ADC with randomized sampling to acquire compressed measurements of combined Rx signals. Since the signals are sparse in the frequency domain, compressive sensing can be effectively applied to capture essential information with significantly fewer samples. Each Rx channel is independently reconstructed via FISTA, enabling signal magnitude estimation at known Tx frequencies. Implemented on an STM32F767 micro-controller, the FFT of fully sampled ADC data yielded an SNR of 39dB, while the compressive sensing reconstruction showed 32dB. Despite a 3:1 reduction in ADC usage, some SNR degradation was unavoidable. However, this trade-off may be acceptable in systems where multiple ADCs cannot be accommodated."

Conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and typically demand high computational resources, which limits their applicability in wearable and real-time healthcare systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a reproducible end to end framework for ECG classification and anomaly detection using a lightweight SNN architecture based on Leaky Integrate and Fire neurons. The framework integrates pre-processing, spike encoding, supervised training, and evaluation, ensuring methodological clarity and replicability. Validated across three benchmark datasets MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, PTB Diagnostic ECG, and ECG Heartbeat Categorization the proposed model achieved accuracies of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$90.35 \\%, 93.25 \\%$</tex>, and 97.8 % respectively. Despite its simplicity, the framework consistently outperformed or matched more complex deep learning and traditional machine learning methods, while requiring far fewer computational resources. These findings highlight the capacity of SNNs to effectively capture temporal and morphological features of ECG signals, enabling reliable detection of arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions. By combining clinical relevance with algorithmic transparency, the study addresses reproducibility gaps in neuromorphic research and demonstrates the feasibility of deploying lightweight SNNs in real-time, low-power cardiac monitoring applications."

This study proposes a diabetes risk classification model based on the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm, integrated with an information-guided oversampling technique named Feature Importance Guided SMOTE (Fi-Guide SMOTE). The proposed method aims to address data imbalance by generating synthetic minority samples based on each feature's contribution to the classification outcome. The dataset consists of 2,000 patient records with nine clinical features, and has undergone preprocessing steps including missing value imputation, normalization, and outlier filtering. Model performance was evaluated across three scenarios: baseline (without oversampling), standard SMOTE, and Fi-Guide SMOTE, using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC as the primary evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that the LightGBM + Fi-Guide SMOTE model improves classification performance, with an F1-score of 97.45% for the diabetes class and an overall accuracy of 98.25%. Although the numerical improvement is relatively small, it has meaningful implications in medical contexts where accurate early detection is critical. These findings indicate that information-guided oversampling can enhance model reliability on imbalanced medical datasets."

    "abstract": "To address the dual challenges of inadequate deep semantic feature representation and limited data diversity in bi-temporal remote sensing change detection (RSCD), we propose a collaborative optimization framework (SRA-VFM) integrating customized data augmentation and hierarchical feature interpretation. SRA-VFM comprises three core components: slice-reassemble augmentation (SRA), a dual-stream feature encoding-decoding network, and a multi-task segmentation head. The SRA module synthesizes diverse training samples through random slicing and semantic reassembly while preserving local feature consistency. The dual-stream encoder, based on the FastSAM pre-trained model, incorporates a top-down feature adapter to align pre-trained features with remote sensing data distributions via cross-level fusion and low-dimensional semantic mapping. The bottom-up decoder leverages semantically aligned pyramid features for progressive upsampling, restoring high-resolution spatial details and enhancing multi-scale representation. The multi-task head jointly optimizes change region detection and edge refinement, accelerating convergence and improving boundary localization. Extensive experiments on 5 benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, CLCD, S2Looking, SYSU-CD) demonstrate SRA-VFM’s superiority over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving mF1/mIoU of 96.01%/92.55%, 97.13%/94.53%, 88.91%/81.21%, 83.13%/48.91%, and 88.36%/79.67% respectively.

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in regulating a wide range of biological functions and are key players in the development of many complex human diseases, making them novel therapeutic targets for drug development. Given the high expenses and time demands of traditional experimental methods, it is essential to develop efficient computational approaches for predicting miRNA-drug interactions (MDIs). This article presents a dual-channel learning framework, SSMDI, based on structural features and Signed Bipartite Graph Neural Network (SBGNN) for predicting MDIs. Firstly, Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) is employed to extract molecular graph features of drugs. Meanwhile, a combined framework of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network and Self-attention Mechanism is utilized to capture sequence features of miRNAs. Compared with traditional networks, signed networks can deliver richer semantic information in drugs and miRNAs. Therefore, SBGNN is then used to aggregate and update the signed topological features of miRNAs and drugs. Finally, structural and signed topological features are integrated to predict MDIs. The predictive performance of the model is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation (CV), achieving AUC of 0.9447 and AUPR of 0.9238. The case study further demonstrates the effectiveness of SSMDI in predicting MDIs. In summary, the SSMDI model proves to be an accurate tool for predicting MDIs, which holds significant implications for drug development and miRNA-based therapeutic research."

    "abstract": "Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">vote mechanism</i> to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks."

Opportunistically, by processing the reflections of this same feedback signal, the base station is also able to estimate the directions of targets present in the environment. To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified projected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of communication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed feedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and sensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks."

    "abstract": "Video traffic continues to surge, pushing codecs toward higher efficiency at the cost of sharply increased complexity. The H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard roughly halves bitrate relative to HEVC at comparable quality but increases encoder complexity substantially. This paper surveys algorithm-level complexity-reduction methods for VVC inter-frame coding, grouping them by decision module—coding unit (CU) partitioning, inter-mode selection, and motion estimation (ME)—and by approach—heuristic/statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). We provide quantitative comparisons of reported complexity–efficiency trade-offs (encoder time vs. BD-rate), and discuss observed trends and potential areas for improvement. Across the literature, CU partitioning is the most heavily targeted module, followed by ME; reported encoder time savings span approximately 10–55% with typically no more than about 3% BD-rate increase, depending on module and method. It is observed that DL methods generally achieve the largest time savings (often around 50% or higher) by predicting partition structures or mode decisions end-to-end, at the expense of training data and inference cost. Heuristic methods remain lightweight and hardware-friendly with small BD-rate impact, and ML methods provide balanced trade-offs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of VVC inter-frame coding, distilling practical lessons and outlining open directions—especially hybrid pipelines that combine inexpensive filters with learned predictors—to guide more efficient VVC implementations and future standards."

    "abstract": "Identifying product obsolescence factors is essential for guiding sustainable design and extending product longevity. Unlike prior studies, this research leverages online consumer reviews to explore product obsolescence factors. First, ChatGPT-4o, an advanced pre-trained large language model (LLM), is utilized to identify these factors. User-generated content (UGC) time series-based product obsolescence indexes are then defined to quantify each factor's impact, offering a UGC-based complement to earlier methods that depended on expert judgment, supplier input, or survey data. By leveraging real-time customer insights, this approach aligns with Industry 4.0 principles, offering a UGC-based method that can support engineering managers to proactively address product obsolescence. It integrates factors' relative importance, determined through frequency–analytic hierarchy process (Freq-AHP), with their severity impact on consumers, assessed using the Robustly optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers approach (RoBERTa). This is further supported by a robustness check, where small perturbations were applied to sentiment intensities and all indices recalculated, confirming the aggregated obsolescence index remained stable across all product categories. This study focuses on consumer IoT devices, an area underexplored in existing literature, analyzing 47,695 online consumer reviews across nine product categories and selecting 4,771 online obsolescence-related reviews for detailed analysis. Findings reveal nineteen key factors and demonstrate a fundamental shift in obsolescence, indicating that product obsolescence of consumer IoT devices is increasingly driven by adaptability, interoperability, and digital resilience rather than physical durability. These insights demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to inform product obsolescence mitigation strategies and guide more resilient, user-centered design in IoT ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Simulating musculoskeletal models in a physics-based environment enables natural motion that follows human biomechanics. However, constructing musculoskeletal models tailored to diverse body shapes is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, achieving robust control over complex, muscle-driven actuation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel shape-parameterized musculoskeletal model that is both anthropometrically and biomechanically plausible. Our approach supports variation in physical attributes—including height, mass, and body shape—as well as muscle–tendon unit parameters. We use the parametric human body model (SMPL) to represent body shape variations and estimate joint locations. From this parameter space, we retarget a template musculoskeletal model to any target shape, adapting both physical properties and muscle-specific parameters. The resulting individualized musculoskeletal models are simulated in a physics-based environment using learned control policies. A hybrid controller combines a stable proportional–derivative servo (PD-servo) servo for the upper body with a Hill-type muscle–tendon model for the lower body.We train these control policies using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control diverse locomotion and solve challenging tasks across a wide range of body configurations and environments."

The system adopts “end-edge-cloud” three-level collaborative architecture, collects data by deploying smart sensors and other equipment on the end side, and uses sliding window mean filtering method and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\sigma$</tex> criterion for data preprocessing; In the edge computing layer, the multi-source data fusion engine and dynamic modeling module are built by using the industrial edge gateway NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, and the data fusion is realized based on D-S evidence theory, and the improved unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to estimate the distribution network state. The cloud collaboration layer is responsible for model training and resource scheduling, builds a load forecasting model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and designs a dynamic task unloading algorithm to optimize the computing load of edge nodes. The experimental results show that the real-time performance of the system is significantly improved compared with the traditional scheme, and the delay in the scenarios of single-phase grounding fault, interphase short-circuit fault and sudden load change is reduced by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$80.6 \\%, 80.0 \\%$</tex> and 81.7 % respectively. In terms of data fusion accuracy, D-S evidence theory reduces the KL divergence of voltage-current data fusion and environmentload data fusion by 0.16 and 0.26 respectively compared with the traditional weighted average method. In terms of resource efficiency, the peak CPU utilization rate of edge computing nodes reaches 68 %, the cloud bandwidth occupation is reduced from 120 Mbps to 35 Mbps, and the model update time is shortened from 15s to 4.2 s; In terms of state estimation error, the improved UKF algorithm is superior to the traditional Kalman filter method under different node data, and the error is significantly reduced."

Mobile devices such as smartphones and wearables connect to EPS via short-range links upon encounter and, based on bidirectional version comparison, update to the newer content. On the EPS side, power consumption is reduced by controlling scanning intervals. We implemented a prototype using M5Paper v1.1 and confirmed basic operations, including content handover and display updates. We also outline a future direction to minimize standby power by introducing wake-up mechanisms triggered by touch/proximity and energy harvesting using piezoelectric elements."

This study proposes a novel deep learning model combining Conv1D, BiLSTM, and GRU layers, optimized using Bayesian methods, to predict drought conditions across three monsoon zones (ZOM 214, 227, and 230). The model was trained on 33 years of dekadal rainfall data (1991-2023) from 34 meteorological stations and evaluated against baseline models including BiLSTM, BiLSTM- GRU, GRU, and CLG. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved superior performance with MAE of 23.83 mm and SMAPE of 65.47%, improving up to 22.1% over the baselines. Most notably, the model demonstrated a 0% failure rate in drought classification, compared to 22.22% for other models. The approach also showed high accuracy in detecting drought onset and peak events across diverse monsoon zones, confirming its suitability for real-time drought early warning systems in tropical monsoon regions."

However, current self-evolution MAS approaches require extensive manual tuning and lack dynamic adaptation, precise issue identification, and modular flexibility. This paper presents E3-MAS, a general-purpose self-evolution framework that organizes agents into three interacting teams—Execution, Evaluation, and Evolution. We detail role-level designs (Planner/Executor/Replanner, Critic/Evaluator, Analyzer/Prompt Optimizer) and show how task-aware evaluation drives problem attribution and prompt refinement. Using a school administrative assistance scenario (C-Pilot), we demonstrate intelligent search and pipeline automation. In a leave-application case study, E3-MAS improves the task progress rate from 0.83 to 1.0 after one evolution cycle. More broadly, the framework consistently achieves progress rates exceeding 0.9, reduces manual prompt-tuning time by over 50%, and enables modular deployment of MAS applications across heterogeneous environments. These results highlight the potential of E3-MAS as a scalable and adaptive paradigm for reliable multi-agent collaboration."

As the video streaming industry experiences rapid growth, competition necessitates innovation to sustain customer engagement and loyalty. Using a quantitative approach with a survey of 240 Indonesian video streaming platform subscribers, this research evaluates five variables: perceived value, service quality, customer engagement, customer loyalty, and Artificial Intelligence. However, the direct effects between service quality and perceived value on customer loyalty were found to be insignificant, indicating that loyalty is primarily driven through customer engagement. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence plays an insignificant role in linking and moderating the relationship between engagement and customer loyalty, indicating video streaming platforms need to prioritize service quality and customer engagement to retain customer loyalty. These results highlight that sustained customer loyalty is better achieved by enhancing customer engagement and delivering consistently high service quality, while rethinking the strategic application of AI to move beyond functional personalization and toward building deeper user involvement and emotional connection."

One of the solutions is to implement Image Super-Resolution (ISR) to upscale the LR images into high-resolution (HR) images. Recent method of ISR is diffusion model that has shown promising in generating high quality of images color; however, it lacks of line sharpness due to residual shifting limitation. This research address the problem by modifying the parameter of the diffusion model to create HR image that has better line sharpness, unfortunately the color is too sensitive, thus this study integrates those two HR images by color swapping based on YCbCr color space. Experimental result on a road scene CH6CN satellite image dataset shows that the proposed model performs better than previous diffusion model with improvement of 1.10% and 1.14% on NIQE and NRQM."

Despite the portability of patient data, LHIMS poses significant challenges as it does not address the specific needs of medical staff workflows in Ghanaian government hospitals, particularly at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). Additionally, the system fails to consider context-related issues such as power outages, poor network connectivity, and the No Bed Syndrome prevalent in the Ghanaian healthcare space. This paper addresses the shortcomings of LHIMS by proposing a new software system that is research-driven and tailored to meet the needs of medical workflows at KBTH. The end-product is a progressive web application that streamlines the hospital's unique operational demands, incorporating comprehensive patient data management, biometric patient facial identification, real-time data integration, and advanced analytics and reporting. This paper contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 3 - Good Health and Well-being by addressing system challenges, emergency issues, and the bed shortage at Korle-Bu; by serving as a model for contextualized hospital management systems, especially for developing regions; and contributing to sustainable healthcare solutions."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of soil carbon stock is vital for global climate stability and supports climate change mitigation. Traditional field-based methods are often limited in scalability and efficiency, encouraging the use of remote sensing and machine learning. While destructive sampling is considered the most accurate for estimating tree biomass, it requires special permits that are often hard to obtain. This study aims to develop an accurate method for classifying soil carbon stock using a hybrid approach that combines ResNet50 for feature extraction with CatBoost and Random Forest for classification. Three datasets were used: 2,114 drone images, 2,526 satellite images from Google Earth Engine (GEE), and a combined set of 2,320 mixed images. Field data were collected from carbon plots at Telkom University and classified into low, medium, and high carbon stock levels. All images were resized, preprocessed, and passed through ResNet50 to extract high-level features before classification. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results show that drone imagery outperformed GEE data. CatBoost achieved the highest test accuracy (84.19%), macro precision (83.63%), recall (84.22%), and F1-score (83.44%). On the other hand, the model trained with only GEE data performed lower recall and F1-scores, hence its low capacity to identify all classes. In general, this research stresses the value of high-resolution imagery in machine learning to enhance the precision of carbon stock classification."

We leverage the YOLOv9 model, a recent advancement in object detection algorithms, to analyse image data from a benchmark dataset designed for smoke detection in agricultural settings. Our approach is rooted in sustainable computing practices, with the model running on energy-efficient hardware that processes data locally, thereby reducing the carbon emissions associated with data transmission and storage. The effectiveness of the YOLOv9 model in our application is quantified by its mean Average Precision (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{m A P}$</tex>) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 3. 2 \\%}$</tex>, Precision of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 1. 3 \\%}$</tex>, and Recall of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 1. 2 \\%}$</tex>, demonstrating robust performance in detecting smoke patterns. This research not only showcases the integration of high-performance AI models with sustainable computing elements but also underscores the critical role of technological innovation in safeguarding agricultural landscapes from environmental disasters. By improving early detection capabilities, we contribute to the development of smart agricultural systems that are both sustainable and resilient, aligning with global efforts towards carbon neutrality and environmental protection."

    "abstract": "Voice assistants are now part of many everyday gadgets, but they often struggle in noisy environments, leaving users frustrated. This paper tackles that problem by combining Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), and Voice interfaces into a single multimodal system. The framework brings together speech, vision, and gestures to provide reliable and flexible interaction. Our experiments show that this approach reduces recognition errors by 27%, cuts latency by 43%, and speeds up task completion by 31% compared with voice-only or cloud-based setups. User studies further confirm that multimodal interaction improves usability, trust, and accessibility across different tasks. The results also show that the system stays stable even in noisy or dynamic conditions while reducing the effort required from users. Overall, this work demonstrates how everyday gadgets can become more dependable and practical when multiple input modes are combined."

    "abstract": "Users are often seated in the real environment, while their virtual avatars either remain standing stationary or move in virtual reality (VR). This creates posture inconsistencies between the real and virtual embodiment representations. The relationship between posture consistency in locomotion techniques and sense of presence in VR is still unclear. This study investigates how visual and somatosensory integration affects the sense of standing (SoSt) and the sense of self-motion (SoSm) when the sitting posture is varied slightly, including highlighting the importance of sitting posture for locomotion design in VR. The degree and occurrence of SoSt and SoSm were assessed by subjective experiments, and it was found that higher sitting and lower sitting postures present higher SoSt and lower SoSm, respectively. Invocation of SoSt also influences postural perception. Perception of travel distance varied according to the posture condition when identical visual flow was presented. The findings suggest that visual and somatosensory integration related to posture enhances SoSt and SoSm, and a sitting posture with a higher seating position is recommended in seated VR locomotion design."

    "abstract": "Learning over dynamic graphs poses major challenges, including capturing the evolving relationship in the graphs. Inspired by the advantages of hyperbolic embedding in static graphs, the hyperbolic space is expected to capture complex interactions in dynamic graphs. However, due to the distortion errors in the standard tangent space mappings, hyperbolic methods become more sensitive to noise and reduce the learning capacity. To address the distortion in tangent space, we proposed HMPTGN, a temporal graph network that operates directly on the hyperbolic manifold. In this journal paper, we introduce the HMPTGN+ architecture, an extension of the original HMPTGN with major updates to learn better representations of dynamic graphs based on the hyperbolic embedding. Our framework incorporates a high-order graph neural network for extracting spatial dependencies, a dilated causal attention mechanism for modeling temporal patterns while preserving causality, and a curvature-awareness mechanism to capture dynamic structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed HMPTGN+ framework over state-of-the-art baselines in both <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">temporal link prediction</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">temporal new link prediction</i> tasks.

    "abstract": "An online adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to solve the infinite-horizon optimal tracking control problem for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), in the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. A novel identifier-critic neural network (NN) architecture is developed to obtain the approximate solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, in which the identifier and critic network weight adaptive laws are designed by gradient descent algorithm. The improved critic network adaptive law can relax the traditional persistence of excitation condition, which facilitates the implementation of the algorithm in practical applications. The time-varying and asymmetric constraint requirement on tracking errors is provided to ensure the satisfaction of transient and steady-state performance. Furthermore, the presented control scheme also works for the unconstrained systems. Through Lyapunov analysis, tracking errors are proved to converge into a small neighborhood of zero. Finally, both numerical simulations and virtual-reality experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme."

However, DL performance can significantly degrade in unfamiliar scenarios, resulting in low-quality CSI predictions that severely impair precoding performance. To address this challenge, we propose a performance monitoring method based on uncertainty estimation to identify and filter out low-quality predictions. Specifically, we incorporate the Monte Carlo dropout technique into the CSI prediction framework, leveraging multiple variable inferences to estimate predictive uncertainty and enable effective monitoring. To further optimize this approach, we integrate ensemble learning with Monte Carlo dropout, facilitating the generation of multiple prediction outcomes in a single inference, thereby reducing the temporal complexity associated with multiple inferences. Simulation results show that proposed methods eliminates over 80% of unqualified predictions across different configurations, significantly enhancing the reliability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have made remarkable progress and are now widely applied in various fields, including image classification, autonomous driving, natural language processing, and medical diagnosis. However, training these models requires large datasets, which often contain substantial amounts of sensitive personal information, such as medical records and financial details. Without effective privacy protection measures during model training, the risk of sensitive data leakage increases, potentially resulting in severe privacy violations and a loss of trust. As an innovative data representation technique, the Negative Database has proven to be an effective solution in privacy-sensitive domains. Negative databases can be derived from SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Problem) instances, and the hardness of these instances is directly correlated with the level of data protection provided by the Negative Databases. Developing efficient SAT instance generation algorithms to create harder SAT instances can significantly enhance the privacy protection capabilities of the Negative Database. This paper analyzes the hardness conditions of SAT solvers using the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning strategy and proposes a two-stage SAT instance generation algorithm to generate harder SAT instances. These hard instances not only aid in constructing more secure negative databases for enhanced privacy protection but also provide valuable test cases for evaluating and improving SAT solvers."

    "abstract": "Multi-space crowd sensing has emerged as a promising paradigm for 3D urban perception. However, it faces critical challenges including space coupling, task heterogeneity, and dynamic resource availability. To address these issues, the Multi-Space Fairness Task Allocation (MSFTA) problem is formulated, aiming to maximize task completion while ensuring fairness across spatial dimensions. The problem is proven to be NP-hard, and a dynamic collaborative optimization framework is proposed. Within this framework, a Multi-Space Clustering QuadTree Voronoi Partition (MCQVP) is developed for fine-grained multi-dimensional partitioning by leveraging DBSCAN and quadtree structures. In addition, a Group Urgency-Based Multi-Shortest Path (GUBMSP) scheduler is incorporated to prioritize time-sensitive task groups via urgency-aware critical paths. Furthermore, a Fairness-Aware Pareto Multi-Objective Ant-Q Learning (FA-PMOAQL) allocator is introduced to integrate Q-learning and ant-colony optimization under fairness-aware multi-objective guidance. These designs establish a unified framework that not only improves task allocation efficiency through multi-space partitioning and urgency-driven scheduling, but also ensures equitable resource utilization by embedding fairness into the learning process. Comparison experiments on Tokyo and New York datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 12.8% higher task completion rate compared with baseline algorithms, while maintaining relatively low runtime. In cross-layer scenarios, the completion rate improves by 20% when agent resources increase, and under heavy task loads it sustains competitive performance with only moderate decline."

    "abstract": "Existing Blind Super-Resolution (BSR) methods are mostly trained on artificial synthetic degradation data pairs or rely on specific degradation priors, which lead to poor performance due to the trained degradation mismatch between other unknown complex degradations in real-world scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Disentangled Degradation representation method for BSR, dubbed D3BSR, which disentangles arbitrary unknown degradation into structure and texture degradations to enhance perception and fidelity quality individually. Specifically, the structure degradation is optimized by degradation distribution transition with a self-supervised collaborative learning strategy to recursively minimize the perception error. The texture degradation is restored through posterior sampling controlled by a fidelity coefficient to leverage rich texture priors encapsulated in a pre-trained diffusion model for preserving fidelity. The degraded image is super-resolved using an analytical solution with the pseudo inverse of the structural and texture degradation, which achieves a controllable trade-off between perception and fidelity and does not rely on any degradation priors or extra-supervised training. Extensive experiments on the nine heavily degraded synthetic and real-world natural and face datasets demonstrate that our D3BSR outperforms SOTA methods on the diverse metrics in reconstruction faithfulness and perceptual quality."

In this work, the absorbing performance of an ultra-thin and inhomogeneous plate designed for EM shielding of discrete sources was researched which showed that the nearly perfect absorption can be fulfilled as long as its constitutive parameters satisfies a particular spatial profile. For illustration, a 0.544mm-thick inhomogeneous absorber working at triple-band was proposed and designed. The measured electric field distributions indicate that the standing wave effects and phase distortion can hardly be observed and the calculated average voltage standing wave ratios at the frequencies of 3.6GHz, 9.8GHz and 11.9GHz were 1.3, 1.18 and 1.22 respectively which were consistent with the theoretical analysis and full-wave simulation."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a novel passive implementation of Synchronized Switch Damping on Inductor technology for resonance attenuation in vibration isolation systems. Replacing active electronics with self-recovered mechanical switches eliminates the need for external power, sensors, and complex control algorithms. The mechanical switches leverage their intrinsic auto-recovery capability to autonomously track vibration displacement extrema, triggering LC oscillations in the piezoelectric shunt circuit near these points to generate velocity-opposing control forces. Parametric studies reveal that optimizing the switch’s free-recovery time constant (via increased damping/reduced stiffness) and preset switch distance enhances extreme-point tracking and isolation performance, particularly effective at higher resonance frequencies. Experimental validation using memory foam-based mechanical switches in an isolation prototype demonstrates a 40% reduction in resonant amplitude compared to the uncontrolled case, successfully replicating simulated behaviors including three distinct operational states (noncontact, transitional, and stable oscillation). The technique maintains robustness against abrupt increases in base vibration. This approach offers a promising maintenance-free solution for scenarios demanding environmental resilience and simplified implementation."

    "abstract": "The research investigates how allicin from garlic interacts with flavonoids to create synergistic antioxidant effects, which shows promise for developing new nutraceuticals. The process of testing different allicin-flavonoid pairs through experimental methods proves too expensive for practical use. The research establishes a predictive machine learning system to find the most effective allicin-flavonoid combinations with synergistic effects at high speed. The research used a computational method that combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) with Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling. The research team built a diverse flavonoid dataset and performed molecular descriptor calculations. The B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) DFT method calculated precise Bond Dissociation Enthalpy (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\triangle \\text{BDE}$</tex>) changes for a selected set of compounds when they formed complexes with allicin. The Random Forest Regressor model received <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\triangle \\text{BDE}$</tex> data as its target variable to establish a relationship between molecular structures and their synergistic effects. The trained model achieved outstanding predictive accuracy, as indicated by an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex> score of 0.89 when evaluated on a separate test dataset. The number of hydroxyl groups (nOH) emerged as the primary factor, explaining more than half of the predictive power, according to feature importance analysis, followed by topological polar surface area (TPSA). The model demonstrates that H-bond donation ability plays a vital role in stabilizing radicals. The research created a dependable ML-QSAR system that enables scientists to design antioxidant combinations through rational methods. The model serves as an efficient high-speed screening system for large virtual flavonoid libraries, enabling the selection of optimal candidates for experimental verification, thereby accelerating the development of therapeutic and nutraceutical agents against oxidative stress."

    "abstract": "The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed data collection, processing, and decision-making across sectors such as healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and transportation, many of which are designated as critical infrastructure. AI-enabled IoT systems enable real-time analytics, predictive maintenance, and autonomous operations, yet they also expand the cybersecurity threat landscape. Regulatory frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), and ISO/IEC 27001 aim to protect sensitive data but often fall short in addressing the unique risks of AI-IoT integration. This paper presents a structured literature review of peer-reviewed research and authoritative standards to examine AI-enabled IoT security risks and associated compliance challenges, with a specific focus on strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure. The analysis identifies gaps in regulatory coverage related to AI-specific threats, third-party dependencies, and human factors influencing compliance. To address these deficiencies, a strategic framework is proposed that incorporates adaptive risk-based security models, AI-driven threat monitoring, vendor oversight mechanisms, and comprehensive stakeholder training. Aligning technical safeguards with evolving regulatory obligations can enhance critical infrastructure against sophisticated threats while ensuring legal and ethical compliance. The findings provide practical insights for policymakers, compliance officers, and cybersecurity practitioners seeking to develop adaptive, future-ready governance models for AI-enabled IoT ecosystems."

This paper presents a redactable blockchain architecture that combines a Redaction Policy Engine (RPE), multi-party validator voting, and post-quantum chameleon hash functions. We introduce a structured lifecycle—from submission and policy validation to execution and logging—anchored by cryptographic enforcement and on-chain governance. Our design supports GDPR-aligned features such as audit trails, user appeals, and purpose limitation enforcement. Implemented on a permissioned Ethereum network, our system demonstrates lower latency (1.82s), gas cost (128.5k), and storage overhead (1.2%) compared to prior solutions. A detailed security and compliance analysis confirms resilience against validator collusion and quantum threats. This work offers a practical framework for deploying redactable blockchains in regulated environments while preserving verifiability and decentralization."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of technology, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technology are profoundly influencing many industries such as communication, power, and manufacturing. In the field of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, optimizing the complementarity of source load resources and achieving coordinated coordination across multiple time scales can not only significantly reduce the operating costs of charging stations, but also effectively reduce the interference of source load randomness on system scheduling strategies. The accurate power load forecasting model provides important support for the intelligent scheduling of EVs. Based on this, this paper proposes a multi time scale intelligent scheduling model for distribution networks based on deep learning (DL). The model first preprocesses the historical data of EV charging load and uses DL technology to dynamically model the reduced dimensional time series data, thereby achieving accurate prediction of charging load. On this basis, the model further optimized the intelligent scheduling strategy of the distribution network. The results indicate that our model has high accuracy in EV load forecasting and can provide strong guarantees for the safety and economic operation of the electrical power system (EPS)."

    "abstract": "Concrete cracking poses a significant challenge in civil infrastructure, as it often signals underlying structural degradation that threatens safety and long-term durability. Manual inspection methods are time-consuming, subjective, and inefficient for large-scale evaluations. This study proposes an enhanced automatic crack classification model that combines HU Moment Invariant features with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Image preprocessing is conducted via grayscale conversion and adaptive histogram equalization to improve contrast and standardize input. Geometric features are then extracted using HU Moments, known for their robustness to rotation, translation, and scale. These features are classified using three variants of SVM—Coarse, Fine, and Medium—to explore trade-offs between accuracy and training time. The system is trained and tested on a dataset of 10,073 concrete surface images categorized into three classes: severe cracks, fine cracks, and non-cracked surfaces. Experimental results show consistent classification accuracy of 77% across all models, with Medium SVM achieving the highest specificity of 81.7%. These findings demonstrate that the HU-SVM approach offers a lightweight, efficient, and accurate solution for concrete crack classification in structural health monitoring systems."

To meet this demand, performance testing plays a key role in delivering fast and reliable software under peak workloads. Traditional performance testing frameworks, such as Apache JMeter, are effective in generating load, but operate independently of analytics or machine learning platforms. This research presents a unified pipeline to integrate RESTful API performance testing using JMeter with telemetry via Google Analytics 4 (GA4), streaming analytics in Google BigQuery, and predictive modeling via BigQuery ML. During load testing, performance metrics are sent as custom events in Google Analytics, exported to BigQuery, and used to train built-in ML models for predicting latency or performance bottlenecks. By using ML models from BigQuery, we want to create a more effective and scalable method for predicting website performance and proactively identifying potential problems. This method enables more accurate and insightful predictions, resulting in proactive optimization and a better user experience."

    "abstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) frequently encounter difficulties in recognizing and interpreting emotions, primarily when their surroundings affect emotional perception. Traditional emotion recognition systems predominantly emphasize facial features, neglecting the influence of environmental cues on emotional comprehension [1]–[2]. This paper introduces a multi-modal Environment Emotion Recognition (EER) framework that combines environmental and facial emotion cues to deliver a more environmentally thorough emotion classification. The suggested methodology utilizes ResNet-18 for environmental and emotional classification, and InceptionResNetV1 with MTCNN-based facial detection for facial emotion recognition. A weighted fusion layer integrates the outputs of both models, emphasizing facial emotion cues upon face detection. The system is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis. Experimental results indicate that the fusion approach improves classification performance relative to independent models, especially in scenarios where environmental context is inadequate. The proposed framework presents potential applications in assistive technologies for ASD, facilitating more nuanced and reliable emotion recognition in real-world environments."

    "abstract": "Solar-powered standalone off-grid systems can be a practical, least-cost solution to providing electricity access to some of the 700 million people presently without electricity. These systems provide electricity while avoiding the potentially high cost of connecting to an existing power grid. Appropriately designing off-grid systems requires an estimate of the load they will serve. There is a continuum of detail that can be included in this estimate. On one end, the estimate consists of a single value representing the average daily electrical energy expected to be consumed. No hourly, daily, or seasonal variation is modeled. On the other end, the load estimate is a high-temporal resolution time series of power consumption throughout the year. It is expected that, for the same level of accuracy, a load estimate with greater detail will result in a more appropriately sized photovoltaic array, battery bank, and inverter. However, a more detailed load estimate is more challenging to produce. It requires additional inputs, such as surveys or historical data from similar users, to create. This paper explores the benefits of increasing the detail of a load estimate. Measured data from off-grid residential systems in the Navajo Nation are used to create accurate load estimates with differing levels of detail. Then, HOMER Pro software is used to redesign the systems based on the different load estimates. The capital cost and reliability of the resulting designs are then evaluated."

However, the risk of loan defaults has increased accordingly. Therefore, it is of great significance to construct a precise loan default prediction model.Aiming at the problems of complex financial loan data and low prediction accuracy of traditional models, this paper proposes a KRF - CNN prediction model that integrates random forests and convolutional neural networks at the model structure level. In this paper, data is pre - processed through KNN interpolation, point - biserial correlation analysis, and chi - square test, and a feature engineering is constructed. Then, Bayesian optimization is used to iteratively select hyperparameters. This model takes advantage of the strong deep - feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks and the strong complex - relationship - handling ability of random forests. The feature maps extracted by the convolutional network are flattened and input into the random forest, taking into account both high - dimensional feature extraction and prediction accuracy, thus improving the prediction accuracy and model robustness.Meanwhile, by combining the XGBoost algorithm, random forests, and convolutional neural networks, an XRF - CNN model with feature - level integration is constructed. The test results show that the loan default prediction accuracy of the KRF - CNN hybrid model reaches 0.8845. Compared with a single random forest, convolutional neural network, and the XRF - CNN model, the accuracy is increased by 2.50%, 1.70%, and 1.46% respectively. This provides new ideas and methods for the prediction and prevention of loan defaults."

In this paper, the mathematical model of TTTLI is established first, and then a double closed-loop control framework based on adaptive parameter optimization is designed. By monitoring the system state in real time and dynamically adjusting the parameters of PI controller, it can cope with complex working conditions such as voltage fluctuation and load change. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed adaptive control algorithm is superior to the traditional PI control algorithm in dynamic response speed, harmonic suppression ability and steady-state accuracy, which can significantly reduce the total harmonic distortion rate (THD) of grid-connected current, improve the system stability and response speed, and verify its effectiveness in improving the gridconnected performance of inverters."

It has widely helped announcers convey messages to the audience quickly and with a pleasant tone in large areas. The benefit is that voice-based announcements help people with visual impairments. In addition, messages can be received directly without looking at them, compared to text-based messages. An announcer with special skills carries out the task of delivering announcements. In addition to requiring particular employees, an announcer may make mistakes when delivering messages. In today’s modern era, an automated public announcement system is essential. Unfortunately, several proposed methods have used static sentences, while actual conditions require dynamic sentences according to current data. For creating dynamic announcement sentences based on current data, this study has worked on forming dynamic sentences using the template-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) method. Next, by using a text-to-speech service, announcement sentences are converted into sound. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) method assesses the system quality. The testing results of the 50 respondents have scored an excellent rate on 7 test items as proof of good system quality, even though naturalness and audio flow need a little improvement. Thus, the proposed method can be applied to automate dynamic public announcements based on current data."

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are among the most lethal types of cancer, with high mortality rates and aggressive progression. Early detection through imaging, particularly MRI, is crucial for improving survival rates. This study evaluates 11 deep learning models which has not been done in previous studies, including CNN, Xception, VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, Inception-ResNetV2, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB3, MobileNetV2, NASNet-Large, and NASNetMobile, for their effectiveness in brain tumor detection using MRI scans. All models were trained and tested with identical preprocessing and hyperparameter settings to compare their performance. Adam optimizers were used to train each model with a learning rate of 0.0001, decay steps of 100, and a decay rate of 0.95 across 50 epochs. Dropout is used to reduce overfitting and speed up the learning process, with a rate of 0.2. L1 and L2 regularization are applied to the three dense layers to prevent overfitting and help the model learn better as it becomes more complex. Each dense layer uses the ReLU function, with 256 neurons in the first layer, 128 neurons in the second, and a SoftMax function in the final layer for classification. The final results show the DenseNet201 model achieves the highest accuracy of 95.65%, while the EfficientNetB3 model achieves the lowest accuracy of 75.89% on the testing data. These findings suggest that deep learning models like DenseNet201 show real potential for enhancing medical imaging diagnostics. Additional research on hybrid architectures, larger and clinical data validation, and fine-tuning are needed in order to improve the generalizability and accuracy of models."

    "abstract": "The rise of online discourse regarding political and ideological beliefs has transformed the YouTube comment section into a space where extremist ideologies are both spread and challenged. The study of online radicalization has often been approached through the lens of sentiment analysis, but several limitations have been identified using this technique. As technology evolves, new tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used in stance detection. This study explores how users engage with extremist content through stance detection and social network analysis. These techniques help researchers analyze both the content of each comment and the emotion behind it. Using a dataset of videos reporting on extremist events, stance detection was applied to classify comments as supporting, against, or neutral. Moreover, social network analysis of the reply structure was used to identify key users and visualize clusters and conversations."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus remains a major global health concern, impacting not only mortality rates but also the quality of life and the sustainability of healthcare systems. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial to slow disease progression and prevent complications. However, conventional diagnostic methods often require complex lab work and trained personnel, which can delay diagnosis, especially in resource-limited areas. This study introduces a machine learning-based diagnostic support system designed to detect diabetes quickly and accurately using standard blood test parameters. The system was trained on a publicly available medical dataset containing 1,015 patient records and 18 clinical features, such as HbA1c, glucose, and cholesterol levels. To address data imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and model performance was validated through k-fold cross-validation as well as external dataset testing. The Random Forest classifier demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an average accuracy of 99%. To benchmark its effectiveness, the model was compared with other algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The findings suggest that machine learning can offer a practical and scalable tool for early diabetes screening, particularly in under-resourced areas. By providing fast and accurate diagnostic support, this system can assist healthcare professionals in improving triage, refining treatment plans, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. Its strong performance indicates potential for real-world clinical integration, offering a valuable second opinion that supports more efficient healthcare delivery."

YOLOV7 algorithm is outstanding in the field of target detection because of its high efficiency and accuracy, but in the face of complex and changeable transmission line corridor environment, the detection accuracy requires further enhancement. In this research, the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and PANet are integrated to strengthen YOLOV7's capability for multi-scale feature fusion, so as to improve the accuracy and robustness of detecting targets of different scales. The findings indicate that integrating a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Network (MFFN) with the YOLOV7 model leads to enhanced performance over the standard YOLOV7 in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score. This improvement markedly boosts the effectiveness and precision of monitoring transmission line corridors. Furthermore, when contrasted with alternative object detection algorithms like Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLOV5, the proposed model exhibits superior capabilities in detecting objects across multiple scales and within complex environments. This research not only ensures safer and more reliable operation of the power grid but also establishes a robust theoretical basis and practical significance for advancing the application of computer vision and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$A I$</tex> technologies within the power industry."

This property drew the attention of the research community to these ciphers. Despite the growing interest in polymorphic ciphers, there is no literature effectively demonstrating the strength and speed of these ciphers. In this paper, we utilize cipher properties such as idempotence, mathematical phenomena like the birthday paradox, and cipher characteristics such as the unicity distance and isomorphism to demonstrate that polymorphic ciphers are stronger than single-key ciphers. We present our analysis through four comparative cases, examining the strength of a single-key cipher and a polymorphic cipher based on the encryption shard/block size. The conclusion from our analysis is that polymorphic ciphers are always at least as secure as a single-key cipher. We also present the conditions under which polymorphic ciphers are always more secure than non-polymorphic ciphers."

    "abstract": "As the complexity of artificial intelligence (AI) tasks like large language models (LLMs) grows, the demand for energy-efficient floating-point (FP) computation has become critical. While the existing computing-in-memory (CIM) designs demonstrate excellent performance in inference tasks with low precision requirements, they face challenges in achieving energy-efficient FP multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. This paper proposes HEMA-CIM, a novel dual-macro hybrid-domain CIM architecture based on: 1) a dual-macro architecture that separates computations into a digital-exponent-CIM (DECIM) macro and an analog-mantissa-CIM (AMCIM) macro; 2) a data-aware DECIM employing high-bit prediction units (HBPUs) and conditional clock gating, which leverages the statistical distribution of exponents to reduce dynamic power without compromising accuracy; 3) a highly efficient AMCIM using novel adaptive range-focusing (ARF) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), with a two-stage, coarse-fine quantization scheme; and 4) a dynamic range aligner (DRA) and a FP formatting unit (FFU) connected with the dual macro to realize a complete FP computation pipeline. HEMA-CIM achieved a peak energy efficiency of 37.2 TFLOPS/W for BF16 MAC operations, representing a 1.18 × to 2.11 × improvement over prior work."

We argue that artificial intelligence (AI) should prioritize long-term human well-being over short-term engagement, and that advancing toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) requires embedding fundamental drives and artificial emotions in model architectures. Building on Lazarus’s cognitive-rational theory, we propose a framework with an emotional module and a rational module, where artificial drives guide affective appraisal and decision-making. This enables alignment of artificial emotions with core values—such as human well-being, fairness, and environmental preservation—anchoring AI safety at the architectural level rather than through post hoc fixes. We discuss technical and ethical challenges, including data needs and reward modeling, and call for open science and regulation to ensure human-centered AGI."

    "abstract": "Sweet corn is a highly valued crop across the world for its nutritional and economical importance. With growing demand for sustainable produce, selecting the most productive and resilient variety is essential to maximising yield while minimising environmental impact. Optimal variety selection must balance environmental, agronomic, and post-harvest factors for productivity and sustainability. For informed varietal selection in sustainable farming, the study emphasises the importance of combining Artificial Intelligence (AI) with process based modelling. In this context, our research combines Digital Twin technology, machine learning models, and process-based environmental simulations to assess and compare two hybrid sweet corn varieties, Golden Honey and Mithas, under organic farming conditions. Utilising deep learning-based algorithms for detecting pests, diseases, and assessing kernel quality, we evaluated both the varieties for their vulnerability to key stressors. We also employed the Denitrification-Decomposition model to simulate yield and carbon footprint, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, and nutrient cycling. According to our findings, Golden Honey performed better than Mithas in terms of yield potential, insect resistance, and kernel quality, while both varieties showed environmental benefits. This study demonstrates how an integrated approach enables data-driven decisions for varietal selection, balancing sustainability and production in sweet corn varieties."

In recent years, mental health issues have received increasing attention in the world of public health, especially among university students. The growing use of social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) has provided users with a space to share experiences and opinions related to mental health. However, posts on social media are often unstructured, using informal language, slang, or sarcasm, making them difficult to manual analysis. This research focuses on comparing Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms for mental health sentiment classification. The dataset used in this research is obtained from GitHub, which contains X user uploads categorized into two classes: Depression (Positive) and Non-Depression (Negative). The findings indicate that the SVM algorithm outperforms Naïve Bayes, achieving an accuracy of 99% across precision, recall, and F1 Score, whereas Naïve Bayes only reaches an accuracy of 87%. This finding shows that the application of hyperplane lines in SVM is more effective in separating two classes, depression and non-depression for sentiment analysis on mental health through social media data."

    "abstract": "We propose a new set of features for audio-based Music Emotion Recognition (MER) that are related to percussion and individual instrument information. One limitation of current feature engineering approaches in MER is that they primarily focus on melodic elements. However, the percussive elements and instrumentation are also essential for conveying and recognizing emotions in music. Our approach leverages the Demucs framework for music source separation (which enables drum channel separation) and the MT3 framework for automatic music transcription and instrument recognition. Building on the results of these frameworks, we created a new set of features that primarily capture information about musical texture, rhythm, dynamics, expressivity, tone color, and musical form. To validate our work, we utilized the MERGE dataset, which comprises over 3000 30-second audio clips annotated with Russell's emotion quadrants. To evaluate the impact of the new features, we compared classification results with those obtained using current state-of-the-art features, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in F1 score (from 71.1% to 74.2%). Moreover, the novel features helped to reduce the confusion between quadrants 3 and 4 (a common difficulty in MER models). The most significant finding of the present study is the impact of separately analyzing the drum channel, whose features proved particularly relevant."

This work builds on spline basis functions, used both for geometry representation and numerical discretization, and extends them with truncated hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) to enable local mesh refinement with structured flexibility. To support standard finite element assembly, multi-level Bézier extraction is applied, allowing THB-spline bases to be expressed in terms of local Bernstein polynomials. Refinement is driven by a least-squares a posteriori error estimator integrated into the spline discretization. A unified formulation is presented that couples this estimator with the harmonic mortaring of the rotor-stator, ensuring consistency of the interface while guiding refinement in the coupled problem. The method is demonstrated with 2D magnetostatic simulations involving a permanent magnet synchronous machine."

However, kinematic uncertainties and external disturbances often hinder mobile manipulators from performing high-precision tasks. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a robust servoing control method. Specifically, we integrate sliding mode control with neural networks to enable accurate motion tracking and assembly operations without requiring precise knowledge of the disturbance model or uncertainty parameters. To ensure the stability of the tracking system, we implement a Barrier Function-based Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (BFASMC) as a self-tuning position controller for the mobile manipulator. This controller compensates for external bounded disturbances while avoiding overestimation of control gains. Additionally, we employ an Input-to-State Stability Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Controller (ISS-LSTM-NNC) as an auxiliary module to handle uncertainties in target motion. As a result, the proposed framework allows the robot to safely and effectively complete dynamic tracking and assembly tasks. We validate our method through experiments on the AMB150-UR5 mobile manipulator, involving both object tracking and assembly operations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method."

Thus, their electrical and thermal performance should be considered carefully in a codesign procedure, especially in the high-frequency range.

The radiation is generated by the laminated resonator antenna (LRA) in the low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) substrate, and then enhanced by the specially designed heatsink structure. To facilitate the independent control of electromagnetic and thermal performance, the vertical structure of the heatsink element is divided into two parts: the upper fins are utilized to enlarge the effective radiation area and thus improve the gain, while the lower fins are designed to satisfy the heat dissipation demand, which has a negligible impact on the radiation performance. The element gain achieves 11.5 dBi at 60 GHz by loading the proposed heatsink structure, and the element spacing reaches 1.25 λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> (λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub> is the wavelength in free space at 60 GHz) for a 4×4 heatsink antenna array.

We also show that only two functions satisfy all QCs in our complete set: the repeated ReLU and flipped ReLU. Thus our complete set of QCs bounds the repeated ReLU as tight as possible up to the sign invariance inherent in quadratic forms. We derive a similar complete set of incremental QCs for repeated ReLU, which can potentially lead to less conservative Lipschitz bounds for ReLU networks than the standard LipSDP approach. The basic constructions are also used to derive the complete sets of QCs for other piecewise linear activation functions such as leaky ReLU, MaxMin, and HouseHolder. Finally, we illustrate the use of the complete set of QCs to assess stability and performance for recurrent neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We rely on a standard copositivity relaxation to formulate the stability/performance condition as a semidefinite program. Simple examples are provided to illustrate that the complete sets of QCs and incremental QCs can yield less conservative bounds than existing sets."

    "abstract": "Traditional image denoising methods apply processing strategies uniformly across entire images, which leads to failure in adapting to the diverse local characteristics and noise patterns. We propose a system that adaptively selects strategies based on the uncertainty by selecting optimal patch sizes and denoising methods. Our system introduces an uncertainty model that has six components, which are used to capture spatial variance, structural proximity, spectral characteristics, algorithmic disagreement, chromatic coherence, and textural discrimination. To predict method selection, a machine learning ensemble is trained on 75,000 diverse samples and achieves a 93.4±1.6% accuracy. The framework employs bilateral filtering, non-local means, and consensus-based denoising as primary methods, with adaptive method selection guided by the uncertainty-based ensemble model. Using these two strategies, when an image is given as input, adaptive patch sizes are applied based on the characteristics, the uncertainty map is found for the patch, relevant function selection is done by the ensemble, and the patches are fused using confidence weights. Consistent improvements of 0.33-0.56 dB PSNR are noted over traditional filters when extensive evaluation is performed over five benchmark datasets (BSD68, Set12, CBSD68, SIDD, DND). An increase of 18% in processing speed is noted, in addition to a 66% decrease in memory usage. A robust generalization is achieved, validated by low cross-dataset performance degradation. The proposed framework emphasizes its potential for broad applicability across imaging domains."

    "abstract": "Embodiment shapes how users verbally express intent when interacting with data through speech interfaces in immersive analytics. Despite growing interest in Natural Language Interactions (NLIs) for visual analytics in immersive environments, users' speech patterns and their use of embodiment cues in speech remain underexplored. Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the gap between users' intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured Speech Input Uncertainty for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how uncertain users' speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data analysis tasks, phases, and Embodiment Reliance driven by the counts and types of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnect and computation, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have become a promising alternative to traditional CMOS circuits. A PIC can be synthesized by mapping the binary decision diagram (BDD) of target functions to optical switches and combiners. However, excessive signal attenuation along the light propagation may require extra optical-electrical signal conversion, thus introducing unwanted delays. In this paper, we aim to overcome this deficiency during logic synthesis: First, we optimize the signal efficiency factor by applying the concept of harmonic mean to optimize DC combiners. Second, we properly arrange these proposed techniques in an optimal sequence of operations to form our main framework. Furthermore, we propose partial harmonic mean to minimize the hardware cost under an efficiency factor constraint. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state of the art in terms of efficiency factor."

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is driving the digitization of traditional manufacturing systems toward intelligent and adaptable factories, where industrial assets are interconnected and capable of collaborating inside and cross-company to enhance production processes. A key enabler of this transition is the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), a standardized digital representation of an asset that encapsulates all asset-relevant information throughout its lifecycle. The AAS ensures that all assets, regardless of their type or function, can be seamlessly integrated into the I4.0, facilitating interoperability and efficient data exchange across the entire production network. However, traditional AAS solutions, namely AAS Types 1 and 2, cannot address all the requirements of modern industry environments. To overcome these limitations, the AAS Type 3 (proactive) extends beyond the conventional functionalities of traditional AAS by incorporating more sophisticated features, enabling I4.0 components to operate with greater autonomy, intelligence, and collaborative capabilities. While traditional AAS implementations (Types 1 and 2) have been widely studied and adopted, research on AAS Type 3 is still in its early stages, lacking formal specifications and standardized guidelines for its design and implementation. In this context, this article presents an agent-based AAS approach for implementing AAS Type 3, offering readers a clearer, more accessible description of its features and practical applicability while encouraging further research and development in this emerging topic. For this purpose, several experiments were performed to gain a better understanding of its application in industrial scenarios. Additionally, the article discusses the experiences, insights, limitations and future perspectives derived from the design and experimental implementation of the agent-based AAS approach."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events increasingly pose risks to public safety and critical infrastructure, especially in underserved and resource-constrained communities. This paper presents a realtime weather alert framework that integrates multivariate time series forecasting with social media analysis to improve situational awareness and risk mitigation. The proposed system employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict key environmental variables, including temperature, wind gusts, precipitation probability, humidity, snow depth, and UV index, over shortterm horizons. To complement these forecasts, a lightweight Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline applies sentiment analysis to social media data using the VADER model, capturing community-level perceptions and concerns. A novel attentionguided fusion mechanism integrates forecast deviations from seasonal thresholds with sentiment-derived weights to compute dynamic risk scores, enabling adaptive prioritization of alerts based on both meteorological severity and real-time social signals. We implement this framework as a functional prototype featuring an inference-driven fusion model, configurable risk parameters, and GPT-powered natural language alert generation. The system automatically delivers targeted alerts to stakeholders when highrisk conditions are detected. By combining environmental and social signals, this framework provides a novel, community-driven approach to climate resilience and early warning systems."

However, hardware-oriented programming is still not easy for software developers, especially, those who have limited knowledge of hardware. We present two case studies to help the developers implement AI subblocks on FPGA systems easily. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) in recent years has led to some important advancements in computer vision, object detection, and object recognition. Visual processing is not the only field that has seen benefits of implementation of CNNs. A plethora of other deep learning and artificial intelligence application have also made major advancements through utilizing these blocks. With the popularity and applications for use of CNNs and DWTs continually showing growth, ensuring the ability to run efficiently and quickly while maintaining high accuracy is a critical building block in advancing the performance of CNNs and DWTs. The System on Chip (SOC) FPGA platform provides great opportunity for improvement of AI cores through the enormous flexibility and software tools available. This paper explores the efforts to accelerate the AI core operation on the SOC FPGA. This includes the methods for improving performance using SIMD thumb instructions. This paper will also investigate the potential methods for achieving performance improvements utilizing high level synthesis (HLS). These different methods of improving the AI cores have been tested and implemented on a Zybo Z7 SOC FPGA using Xilinx Vitus and Xilinx Vitis HLS."

These three 5G pillars have significantly different requirements regarding data rate, latency, connection density, and energy consumption. Implementing a use case within one of these pillars can be challenging, especially in rural areas. Fulfilling the need for continuous service and adaptive response capabilities for sustainable agriculture falls between these three pillars. The 3rd generation partnership project has developed a mid-range use case with a new device type, enabling reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) devices that target lower costs and complexity, smaller physical size, and longer battery life compared to regular 5G NR devices. This paper represents one of the first contributions to the simultaneous deployment of 5G RedCap NR and enhanced machine-type communication networks in rural areas."

We investigate adaptive hash power scheduling strategies for multi-blockchain mining, focusing on revenue optimization across Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bitcoin SV (BSV). We propose and evaluate three approaches—Profit-Weighted, Priority-Based, and Nonlinear Programming (NLP)-Optimized—using real block data during 1-30 April 2025 (13,008 blocks) under simulated total hash power capacities of 100, 200, and 500 PH/s. Our results show that the Priority-Based strategy consistently delivers the highest BTC-equivalent revenue, followed by the Profit-Weighted strategy, which offers competitive performance with a simple allocation mechanism. The NLP-Optimized method provides stable allocation patterns but yields lower revenue overall. Across all configurations, BCH and BTC dominate in both allocation and contribution, while BSV shows persistently lower efficiency. Importantly, revenue growth demonstrates diminishing returns beyond 200 PH/s, and BTC’s contribution share increases with scale—rising from 40.50% at 100 PH/s to 52.15% at 500 PH/s. These findings demonstrate how miner profitability is sensitive not only to strategy design but also to changing market conditions and mining capacity."

This paper proposes a smart retail decision support system based on big data technology. By integrating the sales, inventory and membership data within the enterprise and multi-source data such as external markets and social media, a multi-level data collection, cleaning, storage and processing platform is constructed. The system uses distributed computing architecture, machine learning and deep learning algorithms to realize core functions such as consumer behavior analysis, hybrid recommendation, inventory optimization and sales forecasting, effectively improving data processing efficiency and decision accuracy. In an empirical study of 15TB data of a large retail enterprise, the system showed significant advantages in high-concurrency transaction scenarios: sales, gross profit margin and inventory turnover rate were all improved, while out-of-stock rate and inventory cost were significantly reduced. This study provides an innovative technical path for retail enterprises’ precision marketing and resource allocation and also provides a practical reference for the application of big data technology in traditional industries."

Clear roles are assigned to an OEM server with a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), a Vehicle Mobile Gateway (VMG) / Vehicle Central Computer (VCC) ingress, zonal gateways, and ECUs. To ensure long-term cybersecurity, we adopt post-quantum cryptography (PQC): a hybrid-PQC TLS 1.3 air interface using a PQC key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM), PQC-aware key lifecycle for long-lived artifacts such as firmware metadata and device credentials. Cryptographic workloads are concentrated at the VMG/VCC and zonal gate-ways and ECUs retain final signature verification to preserve end-to-end authenticity.

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death in the Philippines, which reports one of the highest TB-related mortality rates in Southeast Asia. Despite being treatable and curable, poor patient adherence to medication undermines outcomes and contributes to drug-resistant strains—driving healthcare costs up by as much as tenfold. Physicians frequently cite limited communication between patients and providers as a barrier to effective treatment. To address this challenge, a multidisciplinary team developed TrackTB, a low-data mobile application that leverages widely accessible platforms such as Facebook and SMS to improve adherence. The app includes a 2–13 question survey, co-developed with USAID's TB Platforms initiative, to monitor common adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Patient responses are securely transmitted to a clinician portal that visualizes adherence and ADR data in an actionable format. This article describes the development, validation, and planned deployment of TrackTB. In July 2024, fieldwork in Manila included stakeholder engagement and usability testing with patients, healthcare workers, and public health officials. Feedback confirmed the app's accessibility, ease of use, and fit within the existing health care system. TrackTB is now positioned for beta testing in summer 2025. By empowering patients and equipping clinicians with real-time data, TrackTB offers a scalable, cost-effective solution to improve treatment outcomes and reduce TB mortality in the Philippines."

In this paper, we make the following contribution: (i) we propose a pricing-based distributed optimization framework derived from the Lagrangian dual, which decouples the problem into tractable UA and RA subproblems; (ii) we implement the algorithm using CuPy in a GPU-parallel execution pipeline that exploits independence across users, resource blocks, and base stations, enabling high scalability and near real-time operation. Experimental results show that the proposed GPU-based solver achieves a 35× to 55× reduction in total computation delay compared to the CPU implementation. In particular, user association and channel/spectral efficiency computations benefit substantially from GPU parallelism. These findings validate the effectiveness of GPU acceleration for large-scale MU-MIMO scheduling and highlight its potential for practical deployment in next-generation wireless systems."

The source RLSA antenna consists of a radial waveguide with six split-ring slots on the upper plate embedded in the ground plane. A dielectric-based PRS, formed by circular metallic patches printed on the underside of a Rogers RO4003C substrate, is positioned at an optimized height above the RLSA to form a Fabry–Perot cavity, resulting in a boresight pencil gain of 19.9 dBi at 9.7 GHz. The gain of the conical beams in both elevation and azimuth directions reaches approximately 15 dB. A 4×4 microstrip Butler matrix, designed on RT5880, is used to feed the antenna with appropriate phase combinations. The design achieves good performance in terms of axial ratio (< 0.9 dB), sidelobe level (SLL) of the sum beam (–32 dB), and difference beams (–21 dB), with a compact total radius of 89.7 mm. All simulations were performed using CST and validated with HFSS to ensure accuracy and reliability of the results."

    "abstract": "End-To-End (E2E) autonomous driving provides simple structure that directly maps sensor inputs, such as camera images, to steering angles and speeds. However, existing studies have limitations in that the model merely mimics the driving dataset, learning the limitations of the algorithm that generated the data or human drivers. To address this issue, this study proposes a new loss function by extending the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) with two additional regularization terms: a smoothness loss for steering stability and a curvature-based speed penalty for adaptive speed control. The proposed loss function enables the model to go beyond dataset reproduction, learning to decelerate stably in curves and accelerate more aggressively on straight roads. Images were collected using a lane detection-based driving algorithm in the Gazebo simulation environment for training, and intentional lane departure-recovery scenarios were included to improve generalization. Experimental results show that the proposed loss function not only achieves lower steering variance and higher average speed compared to MSE-only models but also outperforms the original driving algorithm used to generate the dataset. This study demonstrates that beyond simple dataset mimicry, a designed loss function can enable an end-to-end model to outperform the very algorithm that generated its training data."

    "abstract": "As the demand for higher data rates and improved spectral efficiency increases in 5 G and upcoming 6 G wireless communication systems, massive MIMO technology has become a key solution and a central area of research While massive MIMO is widely deployed in modern wireless networks, its high-dimensional channels introduce significant challenges, particularly in terms of channel estimation overhead. In order to tackle this challenge, the present paper investigates a channel estimation approach for millimeter-wave massive MIMO uplink systems, which is based on a self-encoder, leveraging the low-overhead advantage of neural networks. Traditional channel estimation and interference suppression methods struggle with excessive computational complexity and performance bottlenecks in high-dimensional environments. In order to address these limitations, this paper introduces a neural network-driven method for channel estimation and interference suppression, with the goal of improving the performance of massive MIMO systems. The critical challenges of channel estimation in massive MIMO are analyzed, and a deep learning-based neural network model is designed to achieve efficient and accurate channel estimation. Additionally, to mitigate interference in massive MIMO systems, an optimization algorithm based on neural networks is introduced, effectively reducing interference and improving system capacity and signal quality through network training. Simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that the neural network-based approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, this paper discusses the practical application prospects and potential optimization directions of the proposed method, offering theoretical support and technical insights for the real-world deployment of massive MIMO systems."

It achieves 97.5 % accuracy on academic essays and 94.5% in cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8 % and memory usage by 59 % relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, and Mixtral) across four prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion. Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5 x higher style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting repeatedly reaches 99.9 % agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation does not imply human-like unpredictability: human essays average a perplexity of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation."

However, retaining existing consumers has become a very tough task for online grocery providers. This study adopts attitude-behavior-context theory with the aim of analyzing factors that influence consumer loyalty in online grocery in Indonesia from a consumer experience perspective, using the Segari application as a case study. This study employed a mixed-methods approach, involving 480 survey respondents and 15 interviews with online grocery users. Quantitative data analysis was analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling, while qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The results indicate that customer service, product experience, and delivery experience play roles in building customer loyalty to continue using an online grocery app, primarily through online customer experience and engagement, while personalization contributes to customer engagement. However, the online customer experience is not significantly impacted by economic value, personalization, or application experience. Online grocery service providers can use the insights from this study to improve the caliber of their apps and cultivate client loyalty. (Abstract)"

While CLIP supports prompt-based recognition, naïve uniform aggregation of per-class scores (e.g., max/mean) ignores finding multiplicity and can limit accuracy. We introduce Count-Aware Noisy-OR (CANOR), a plug-and-play aggregation head that is parameter-efficient: it trains only 6,169 of 151,277,313 parameters (0.004%) while keeping the CLIP encoders frozen. CANOR leverages image-level multi-label supervision with count-aware training—weighting each sample by its pathology count—and learns a small set of calibration scalars (one global temperature and class-wise biases), together with a noisy-OR aggregation rule that accounts for disease co-occurrence. On CheXpert, CANOR modestly improves accuracy while maintaining comparable AUC and F1 to published baselines, and adds negligible inference overhead. These results indicate that exploiting the structure of multi-label supervision with a count-aware noisy-OR head yields consistent improvements with minimal additional parameters."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning method that can train models without centralizing the original data sets. However, the large-scale federated learning training requires a lot of network communication bandwidth for gradient exchange, which limits the scalability of multi-node training. Mobile devices are more seriously affected by high latency and low bandwidth in federated learning on the move. To reduce the communication overhead and accelerate the federated training process, this paper proposes an adaptive threshold selection gradient sparsification algorithm. However, gradient sparsification algorithms often result in model accuracy loss in federated learning. In order to ensure that federated learning does not suffer from model accuracy loss due to gradient sparsification, this paper further proposes a momentum compensation algorithm, which determines the effective ratio of old gradients and new gradients based on the loss value during the model training process, thereby generating new gradient information. Finally, the algorithm is deployed on the data processing unit, utilizing the data parallelism and communication capabilities of the DPU to assist training. In this experiment, the classical CNN model was adopted, LeNet-5 and ResNet-101 were used for image classification, and mnist and cifar10 data sets were used for testing. Compared with the traditional Top-1% sparse algorithm, the communication compression ratio of the proposed method can be improved by about 40%."

This micro-scale study combines the Expectation-Confirmation Model of IS Continuance with the analysis of the effects of gamification elements, like levels, rewards, and points, on autonomy, competence, and relatedness in Self-Determination Theory to analyze the influence of intrinsic motivation on satisfaction and continuance intention. Data collected through an online survey involving 415 digital banking app users in Indonesia and analyzed using PLS-SEM with the help of SmartPLS4 software. The results show that gamification increases autonomy and relatedness, which contribute positively to intrinsic motivation, while competence has no significant effect. Intrinsic motivation also increases satisfaction, which in turn drives satisfaction and intention to keep utilizing. Therefore, this research provides valuable insights for developers in creating more effective gamification strategies that aim to increase user satisfaction and ultimately drive continued usage of digital banking apps."

The performance of the combined Chi<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> feature selection with the hybrid BCA-Bayesian Optimization is evaluated across various n-gram configurations. Results indicate notable improvements in both accuracy and recall compared to conventional methods. The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 93.80% with unigrams and a recall of 100% with four-grams, surpassing the conventional Chi2-BCA hybrid approach. Although the Chi<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>-BCA method exhibits lower computational complexity, the Bayesian Optimization-enhanced model demonstrated superior classification performance.

Traditional methods rely on photo-identification, which entail extensive expert efforts during and after the field studies. These efforts include drawing sketches that highlight the scars and mutilations of documented individuals, as manatees often sustain injuries from encounters with boats, fishing gear, and other hazards, leaving unique scars or mutilations on their bodies. Despite using strategies to narrow down possible results, identifying an individual manatee from a database containing tens of thousands of sketches remains a challenge. Traditional image-by-image search methods struggle with the uniformity of these sketches, which are derived from a standard template and contain arbitrarily shaped regions in a low-resolution and monochromatic format. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based framework leveraging Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) to explicitly learn and extract markers from sketch images and further employ makers to fulfill image search and matching. Unlike other DNN methods, our approach is fully transparent and interpretable, through representing markers as polygons and carrying out matching based on the overlaps between polygons. Benchmark experiments on real-world sketch images substantiate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving a Top-1 accuracy of 0.3205, and improving Top-5 and Top-10 accuracies to 0.4872 and 0.6026, respectively. This advancement showcases the potential of using DNNs for effective identification of individual manatees for conservation studies."

    "abstract": "High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) are promising candidates for high current Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) for large high-field magnets. In many cases, these CICCs are made from stacks of several HTS tapes. This work focuses on the thermal contact resistance in various metal to-metal interfaces among tapes and between tapes and surrounding materials. Three main configurations were examined: soldered tapes, unsoldered tapes, and braided copper structures wrapped around the HTS tapes (BRAST). Samples were tested in a controlled cryogenic environment, from 6 K to 300 K, under applied forces ranging from 50 N to 200 N. The analysis reveals that thermal contact resistance plays a prominent role at low temperatures and can be reduced by increasing the applied force. For soldered tapes, an additional reduction in thermal contact resistance was observed after the removal of surface oxides. Unsoldered tapes, by contrast, showed higher sensitivity to contact pressure, pointing to the importance of precise mechanical alignment. These observations highlight the importance of interface quality, contact characteristics, and surface preparation in minimizing thermal contact resistance in HTS cables. By varying the temperature and applied force during measurements, it was possible to characterize the distinct contributions from each interface type, offering valuable insights for improving thermal performance in superconducting systems operating at cryogenic temperatures."

    "abstract": "Consistent perturbation strategies have emerged as a dominant paradigm in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, prevailing approaches inadequately address two critical challenges: (1) prediction errors induced by data uncertainty from distribution shifts, and (2) loss instability caused by model uncertainty in parameter generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Correction (UGAC) framework with three key innovations. First, we develop a dual-path uncertainty rectification mechanism that employs normalized entropy measures to detect error-prone regions in unlabeled predictions, followed by bilateral correction through confidence-weighted fusion. Second, we introduce adversarial consistency constraints that leverage labeled data to discriminate authentic segmentation patterns, effectively regularizing uncertainty propagation in unlabeled predictions through spectral normalization. Third, we architect a frequency-aware segmentation backbone through our novel Freqfusion module, which performs adaptive spectral decomposition during feature decoding to explicitly disentangle high-frequency (boundary-aware) and low-frequency (structural) components, thereby enhancing anatomical boundary sensitivity. Comprehensive evaluations on MM-WHS, BUSI, M&Ms and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate UGAC’s superior performance. The proposed framework exhibits robust generalizability across CT, MRI, and ultrasound modalities, while achieving significantly lower computational complexity than baseline UNet implementations. The code will be available at https://github.com/SIGMACX/UGAC."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multifunctional metamaterial based on an antenna-filter/polarization converting-antenna (A-F/ PC-A) module array, that could provide ultra-wideband transmission (Tx), polarization conversion (PC), and reflection (Rx) responses for two polarizations through six active modes. Reconfigurable receiving and radiating antenna arrays are elaborately designed to enable this system could operate under arbitrarily linear polarized waves. Moreover, to further facilitate the polarization manipulation between the receiving and radiating antennas arrays, while providing a good impedance matching for each operating mode, an improved active filter array with strong coupling mode and PC mode is proposed. Attributing to the proposed second-order structure, high-transmittance windows (the minimum insertion loss is 0.1 dB) with a −3 dB fractional bandwidth of 66.7% are realized in the Tx mode. Within this passband, the polarization characteristics and transmission state of the incidence electromagnetic wave can be flexibly modulated. In the PC mode, the relative bandwidth with a polarization conversion rate (PCR) of more than 90% reaches 55.6%. When switching to Rx mode, the structure acts as an effective electromagnetic shield with the transmission coefficient below -10 dB throughout the operating band. Finally, a prototype is fabricated for measurements, and the calculated, simulated, and measured results validate the proposed design."

    "abstract": "Soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) have demonstrated significant advantages in unstructured environments due to their geometrically nonlinear deformations characterized by large deflections, high strain, and curvature. However, existing SPA designs predominantly exhibit unidirectional actuation or require mechanical transmissions for multidirectional bending actuation, which restricts their operational flexibility. To solve this limitation, this article proposes a multidirectional bending fiber-reinforced soft pneumatic actuator (MDB-FRSPA), and studies its deformation response characteristics under multiple pneumatic boundary conditions. We establish a response surface model for free-end contact force characterization in the MDB-FRSPA. A moment equilibrium-based quasi-static modeling approach is proposed for investigating the correlation between bending angles and internal pressures across varying pressurization states. Building upon this foundation, an experimental testbed is established for validation analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the contact force output and deformation response characteristics under varying pressure conditions closely align with both finite element method results and theoretical predictions. Experimental validation confirms enhanced adaptability and operational stability of the three-mode flexible gripper with self-reconfigurability composed of MDB-FRSPA s during complex grasping tasks."

Both static and dynamic ETC schemes can be used separately to alleviate the computational load and communication resources. The proposed static and dynamic event-triggering conditions differ from existing approaches in terms of condition design and stability proof. The static event-triggered mechanism (ETM) relies solely on the system state, whereas the dynamic ETM integrates the system state with an internal variable derived from a differential equation. The decentralized event-triggered (ET) controller is established for the large-scale system, which is comprised of many ETC policies for each individual subsystem. Based on the critic-only architecture, the optimal policies are obtained within the adaptive critic framework by solving the relevant ET Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equation. Specifically, the weight vectors of critic neural networks (NNs) are updated using a novel gradient descent strategy with momentum. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed method is validated through two simulation examples."

    "abstract": "With the large-scale commercial deployment of fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) networks, cellular-based localization has emerged as a cost-effective solution for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, existing methods face two critical challenges: input sparsity and dimensionality explosion due to the exponential growth of Base Stations (BSs) in wide-area scenarios, and underutilization of diverse cellular signal parameters. To address these issues, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN)-based framework for seamless large-scale cellular localization. First, we model cellular associations as a heterogeneous graph of User Equipments (UEs) and BSs, bypassing fixed-dimensional input constraints inherent to conventional input form. This graph also explicitly utilizes cell-type relationships and topology features to enhance structural expressiveness. Then a dynamic pruning strategy is introduced to remove spatial irrevelent nodes, reducing structural noise. Further, meta-paths with explicit semantics are designed to constrain information propagation with interpretable spatial-semantic rules. Building on this graph, we propose a Heterogeneous Multi-feature enhanced graph ATtention network (HMAT) to fully utilize diverse features in the graph across metapaths for accurate and robust coordinate regression. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight variant, L-HMAT, with fewer parameters and zero-shot localization capability in new regions. Extensive experiments on three real-world cellular network datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on large-scale cellular data."

    "abstract": "The scattering center (SC) model provides a compact, physically interpretable, and efficient representation of electromagnetic (EM) scattering by approximating the total field as a superposition of dominant contributors characterized by location, amplitude, and phase. However, extending the SC model to three-dimensional (3D) dielectric objects remains challenging due to complex scattering mechanisms inherent to 3D dielectric objects. This paper presents a physics-informed dual-branch convolutional learning (PhiDCL) neural network for efficient, accurate, and interpretable EM scattering from arbitrarily shaped 3D dielectric objects. The proposed approach employs a dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the real and imaginary components of the complex scattering weights associated with equivalent scattering centers. By incorporating wavelength-scale geometric embedding and directional feature encoding, the network captures physically meaningful scattering behaviors while requiring only a limited set of full-wave simulations for training. Extensive validation on canonical and realistic objects, including cones, cubes, SLICY-like structures, and UAVs, demonstrates that PhiDCL achieves accurate radar cross-section (RCS) predictions with consistently low mean absolute errors (typically below 1 dB) across different geometries, material parameters, and incident angles. Compared with traditional numerical full-wave methods, it improves the computational efficiency by more than two orders of magnitude. The resulting parametric model serves as a scalable surrogate for rapid RCS estimation, target recognition, and inverse scattering analysis, enabling real-time EM signature prediction in resource-constrained applications."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a step-up/down hybrid converter for USB power delivery (PD). The proposed converter features a wide range of voltage conversions similar to the conventional four-switch buck-boost converter (FSBBC). Compared with the FSBBC, the average inductor current of the proposed converter is decreased to a certain extent for all operation modes, reducing the power loss caused by dc resistance (DCR) of inductors. Additionally, the transfer function of the proposed converter demonstrates that the right-half-plane (RHP) zero is pushed to a higher frequency in boost mode compared to FSBBC, simplifying compensator design for voltage-mode control. Moreover, the proposed converter is adaptable to the new USB PD 3.1 standard and the maximum output power is configurable up to 240 W (i.e., 48 V/5 A). Detailed dc analysis, small-signal modeling, loss analysis, and overall circuit implementation of the proposed converter are also included in the paper. Measurement results verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed converter. A peak efficiency of 96.8% is achieved when the converter operates in light boost mode at 1.5-A load current."

These studies mainly transfer the inherent motion patterns from the source videos to the edited ones, where they often produce inferior results with inconsistency to user intentions, especially when shape changes between the edited and original objects might occur, due to the lack of particular alignments between the delivered motions and edited content. To address this limitation, we present a shape-consistent video editing method, namely StableV2V. Our method decomposes the entire editing pipeline into several sequential procedures, where we first edit the initial video frame, then simulate the shape-aware alignment between the delivered motions and edited sequence, and propagate the edited content to all other frames based on such alignment. Furthermore, we curate a testing benchmark, namely DAVIS-Edit, to offer a comprehensive evaluation of video editing, considering various types of prompts and difficulties. Experimental results and analyses illustrate the superior performance, visual consistency, and inference efficiency of our proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art video editing studies."

Early detection is essential to improving survival rates, and it relies heavily on digital breast imaging for effective screening and diagnosis. Low resolution, distortions, and noise often damage the quality of these photographs, therefore affecting the correct interpretation. We propose an approach to enhance digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images using advanced filtering and enhancement techniques. We used three techniques—BD, TVM, and FWMF—to enhance image clarity while preserving essential characteristics. We measured MSE, PSNR, and CNR to see how well these methods worked. The results indicate that FWMF achieves the lowest MSE (0.000030), the highest CNR (29.36), and the best PSNR (45.76 dB) among alternative approaches. These results indicate that FWMF is the best way to raise the quality of DBT pictures, therefore increasing the accuracy of detection and diagnosis of breast cancer."

Traditional statistical models have limitations in dealing with nonlinear characteristics and complex traffic patterns, while modern machine learning and deep learning models can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. However, the existing models still have shortcomings in prediction accuracy and convergence speed. This article proposes a traffic flow prediction model optimized based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. By introducing attention mechanism, bidirectional LSTM structure, and Dropout mechanism, combined with grid search method to optimize parameter combination, the model's generalization ability and prediction accuracy are further improved. The experimental data comes from real-time traffic flow records, weather data and special event data of a city traffic management department. The experimental results show that the mean square error (MSE) of the optimized LSTM model is reduced by 26% compared with the traditional LSTM model, and the convergence speed is increased by about 29%, showing higher prediction accuracy and stability. The model shows high accuracy in regular time periods such as morning and evening peak hours on weekdays."

There were 268 students who were asked via an online questionnaire and analyzed using SmartPLS. There is a research model that is tested in two stages (PLS Algorithm and Bootstrapping Process), and analysis is carried out according to research hypothesis testing. The research results found that digital technology adoption and digital literacy were able to support positive student self-efficacy. Digital technology adoption plays an important role in increasing student abilities (self-efficacy). It was directly found that self-efficacy and digital literacy were able to support increasing students' entrepreneurial intentions. The model study found that there was good mediation from self-efficacy in supporting the relationship between digital literacy and student entrepreneurial intention.

However, ensuring positive community impact can be challenging. One significant challenge is project continuity and maintaining relationships with the community throughout the year. To help address this, a partnership between HE courses which involve field experiences and a two-semester engineering capstone course, the Global Capstone Design Sequence, was established. Results from this collaboration have shown positive impacts on the relationship with the community, improved quality of student project work, an increase in student motivation, and gains in student intercultural competency. This paper documents the structure of this partnership and the lessons learned. Additionally, to assess the impact of this partnership on student intercultural competence, an analysis of Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) scores is performed.

However, the electrolyte thickness critically affects the electrochemical performance of these batteries, especially under high-rate operation. In this study, a one-dimensional, isothermal model was developed to investigate the impact of electrolyte thickness variations (5 μm, 25 μm, 45 μm, 65 μm, and 85 μm) on discharge behavior across different C-rates (1C and 2C) and ionic conductivities (0.02 S/m and 1 S/m). Simulation results demonstrate that increased electrolyte thickness leads to higher ohmic polarization, faster voltage decay, and reduced delivered capacity, particularly under fast discharge conditions. Furthermore, higher ionic conductivity effectively mitigates these losses, enabling thicker designs without severe performance penalties. These results provide important insights into the design optimization of solid-state battery architectures, highlighting the trade-off between mechanical robustness and electrochemical efficiency."

In the experimental verification stage, this paper selects the real line loss data set of low voltage station area, and makes a comprehensive test and evaluation of the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm performs well in key indexes such as accuracy and recall, and can accurately identify abnormal points in line loss data. The loss reduction strategy based on the experimental results has achieved remarkable results in practical application, effectively reducing the line loss rate and improving the operation efficiency of the power grid. This research method enriches the theoretical research of line loss anomaly detection, and also provides practical guidance for line loss management in power enterprises. The research conclusion shows that the line loss anomaly detection algorithm based on local outliers has high practical value and application prospect."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive modeling and simulation study of a 100 kW photovoltaic (PV) system using the Sandia Array Performance Model (SAPM). The simulation incorporates real-world data, including solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and measured DC/AC electrical quantities. SAPM, an empirical model developed for predicting PV array output, is employed to estimate DC power as a function of environmental variables. The simulation results are evaluated against experimental field measurements to assess the model’s predictive accuracy. The study demonstrates a strong correlation between measured and simulated outputs, with a mean power error of just 42.12 W. Further statistical validation using RMSE and MAPE confirms the reliability of the SAPM under real-world operating conditions, particularly for high-power PV systems deployed in harsh climates. These results provide critical insights into performance modeling and highlight environmental and system-level factors influencing energy yield. Ultimately, the findings contribute to the broader effort of optimizing large-scale PV systems through robust empirical modeling."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the continuous evolution of malicious software (malware) has posed an increasingly significant threat to governments, research institutions, businesses, and military organizations. Numerous malware variants have been developed with the aim of exfiltrating sensitive information, compromising industrial infrastructure operations, or extorting money causing serious financial, reputational, and operational repercussions for the affected entities. Among the most widespread types of malware are rootkits, botnets, spyware, trojans, and ransomware. Many of these, despite posing a serious threat, rely on traditional asymmetric cryptographic primitives such as Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and Digital Signature Algorithms (DSAs), which are vulnerable to the advent of Quantum Computing. An attacker equipped with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could employ algorithms such as Shor’s and Grover’s to derive private keys from public ones, thereby compromising the entire security model upon which these systems are based. Consequently, the transition towards post-quantum cryptographic algorithms becomes imperative in order to guarantee robustness and long-term resilience in such adversarial scenarios. In this context, this study proposes the design and implementation of a post-quantum ransomware/mal-ware, capable of successfully fulfilling its objectives even in the presence of an adversary with quantum capabilities. The malware leverages post-quantum cryptographic primitives, integrated with a decentralized, blockchain-based PKI infrastructure compatible with quantum-resistant algorithms, thereby ensuring the system’s resilience in a post-quantum cryptographic landscape."

However, these technologies often fails to serve people with speech impairments, creating persistent barriers to communication, education, and inclusion. The re-search introduces a humanitarian-focused NLP system designed to bridge this gap by integrating emotional recognition into the visual text processing pipeline. This system extracts text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), classifies the emotional tone of the extracted content using sentiment analysis, and converts it into audible speech using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. This dual-layer processing particularly supports speech-impaired individuals by enabling them to access not only content but also the emotional tone, bridging criti-cal communication gaps. This project brings forward a more meaningful interactions with written content, particularly for those with impairments affecting literacy, vision, or cognitive processing."

We present a lightweight and model-agnostic method that improves QA performance by dynamically rephrasing complex questions into stepwise subquestions, effectively guiding the reasoning process without additional training or architectural modifications. Experiments on the LongBench and LongBench v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, achieving average gains of 2–5% and reaching up 10% in specific domains. We further validate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to two representative SLM families, LLaMA and GLM, observing consistent gains across both."

    "abstract": "Developed countries have a clear advantage over developing nations due to greater access to modern technologies and stronger cognitive support from educators. Effective teaching strategies enhance information processing and reduce cognitive load, significantly influencing student achievement [1]. As the world confronts climate change, the development and adoption of renewable energy technologies becomes vital [2]. Among them, solar-photovoltaic (PV) technology stands out for its recent advancements [3]. However, its implementation in developing countries is limited by a persistent technological gap [4]. In Ecuador, approximately 3800 new electric engineers graduate every year, most of them without practical experience in testing renewable energy components, due to the lack of test benches in local Universities. Optimizing PV-system performance requires accurate measurement of electrical characteristics, particularly the current-voltage (IV) curve. This curve provides critical information on panel efficiency, aging, and environmental impacts, essential for effective design, maintenance, and system optimization. This study proposes a low-cost solution using an Arduino microcontroller connected to a custom electronic load circuit to vary panel voltage and measure current. A machine learning algorithm models the IV curve, while MATLAB handles control, data processing, and visualization through a Graphical User Interface. Results indicate that, even with basic hardware and software tools, efficient data acquisition and analysis are achievable. Machine learning significantly enhances IV curve modeling by enabling reliable, fast curve fitting based on historical data, offering a valuable tool for PV system monitoring in resource-limited countries. This system enables hands-on PV diagnostics in engineering labs and remote solar sites in developing countries"

    "abstract": "Amid a rising interest in edge-based computer vision applications for customer analysis and marketing, this paper explores the application of a modified Faster R-CNN model for the multi-task object detection of age range, gender, and facial-expression classification from facial bounding boxes. Pre-trained ResNet50 and MobileNetV3 backbones were also implemented and compared to assess the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. Experiment results indicate that the effectiveness of multi-task models vary widely, ranging from about 50% lower to 60% higher than single-task models, depending on the specific classification task. MobileNetV3 generally produces better results in age and gender classification, while ResNet50 performs better in facial expression recognition. Furthermore, testing on images containing only a single individual shows a marked improvement in performance, indicating that reducing dataset complexity, such as limiting images to a single person, can improve model accuracy. Among these tasks, gender classification consistently achieves the highest performance, highlighting the greater difficulty in age and expression classification due to complex aging patterns and subtle facial expressions. Although limited in dataset quality, these findings confirm the model’s viability and practicality for real-time data collection and analysis on edge devices."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 excel at text generation but struggle with commonsense reasoning, often producing logically flawed or unsafe responses (e.g., \"water is dry\" or \"bleach cures infection\"). This paper introduces Commonsense Reasoning 2.0, a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with structured knowledge bases (KBs) to enhance verifiability and explainability. The framework combines three components: knowledge grounding (anchoring outputs in axioms such as physics laws), constraint-based generation (eliminating infeasible inferences via logic rules), and interactive refinement (dynamically updating KBs through human-AI feedback). We address GPT-4's limitations in causal, temporal, and social reasoning and demonstrate how symbolic KBs such as Cyc and ConceptNet enforce logical constraints. The framework navigates scalability and interpretability trade-offs through modular design and LLM-driven rule synthesis. In contrast to rigid symbolic systems or purely statistical LLMs, our approach maintains generative flexibility while enhancing safety and transparency. We present a taxonomy of GPT-4 commonsense failures and a design blueprint for scalable hybrid systems. A qualitative evaluation using examples from CommonsenseQA and HellaSwag shows the system’s ability to reject flawed outputs. Plans for future quantitative benchmarking are outlined. We conclude that symbolic reasoning must be embedded into AI systems to move beyond surface-level fluency toward trustworthy understanding."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of retail sales data offers both opportunities and challenges for businesses in understanding customer behavior and optimizing operational strategies. This study addresses the issue of manual and intuition-based product categorization, which often leads to suboptimal pricing, inventory control, and marketing efforts. To overcome this, we implement and compare two unsupervised machine learning algorithms—K Means and Hierarchical Clustering—for segmenting products based on transaction patterns. Using a dataset consisting of one month of sales from a retail microbusiness, the study includes data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using three widely accepted metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. The results indicate that K-Means with five clusters (K=5) yields more optimal segmentation in terms of compactness, separation, and overall cluster quality. These findings provide valuable insights for data-driven decision-making in microbusinesses, particularly in optimizing pricing strategies, stock management, and targeted marketing initiatives. This study shows that using machine learning is important not just for sorting data, but also for making smart plans in small retail stores. The findings can help build better tools for predicting customer behavior and creating tailored marketing approaches."

This study aims to design and evaluate an Android-based auto-lockscreen application to support parental control over children's device usage. The system was developed using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology, which includes the phases of Analysis, Design, Prototyping, and Testing. Functional evaluation was conducted using black-box testing, while usability was assessed using the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS). The questionnaire encompasses five major domains: screen design, ease of learning, system capabilities, clarity of information, and overall user reaction. A total of 21 parents participated as respondents during the application testing phase. Results show that the application achieved an average usability score of 4.20 out of 5.00, with the highest score found in the \"overall reaction\" domain (4.30). These results indicate that the application is effective, user-friendly, and meets the expectations of parents seeking digital supervision tools. Moreover, the use of RAD facilitated a user-centered development process that allowed for rapid iteration and feedback integration. This research offers a practical contribution to the design of adaptive and accessible parental control applications based on auto-lockscreen mechanisms for child device usage."

With the widespread use of the Internet and social media in Indonesia, Ponzi schemes have found an effective means of spreading and attracting new victims. In this context, the research develops a prototype application based on LLM and Generative AI that can detect signs of a Ponzi scheme in social media content. The research methods include collecting textual data from social media associated with Ponzi and non-Ponzi schemes, model training using prompt engineering techniques, and few-shot learning with LLM, specifically ChatGPT and OpenAI. The Python, Gradio, and OpenAI APIs were used to develop the application prototype, which facilitates the analysis of text and the classification of potential Ponzi schemes through clear reasoning. The research reveals that the developed application can detect indications of a Ponzi scheme with a 92% accuracy rate.

    "abstract": "This article examines how identity is constructed through digital media by using an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates technology, culture, and gender studies. The study explores TikTok’s #girlhood, a trend that aims to redefine the performance of femininity as self-affirming rather than compliance with the patriarchal power structure. Through the portrayal of unabashed femininity and sisterhood, the trend contributes to shaping and negotiating the identities of young women online. This research utilizes a mix of quantitative content analysis and Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to assess how the TikTok trend represents postfeminist media culture sensibilities that frame personal choice as empowerment while reinforcing normative femininity. The results of this study reveal that the #girlhood trend does encourage young women to freely express their femininity, but simultaneously upholds constant bodily control and lifestyle regulation. This phenomenon suggests that young women’s identity is still mediated through adherence to a particular standard of femininity under the guise of empowerment, reflecting the complex realities of navigating the self in postfeminist digital culture."

    "abstract": "Rapid population growth and rising unemployment rates in Indonesia create intense competition among job seekers, emphasizing the importance of adequate interview preparation. AI-Based interview platforms, such as WawancaraAI, provide solutions through practice interviews. However, usability issues include users not paying much attention to the initial interview session guide and difficulty understanding the questions given by the AI. Besides the AI's inconsistency, it cannot adjust the answer, asks questions irrelevant to the context, and is less interactive. This research evaluates the usability and user experience of WawancaraAI using System Usability Scale (SUS) and Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA). The SUS questionnaire involved 100 respondents, resulting in a SUS score of 67.925 (marginal high), with the lowest scores indicating problems in technical support, platform consistency, and ease of use. Additionally, 30 participants in CTA sessions who performed six tasks revealed issues like unappealing presented instructions, no help features, difficulty understanding AI questions, and the AI’s inability to personalize questions based on user backgrounds. The study recommends improving interactive guidance, adding a help button, adding subtitles during interviews, and adding CV uploads for better personalization. This study combines two methodologies to improve the use of AI in the interview platform to support better job preparedness and provide additional knowledge for academics."

This paper presents a detailed investigation into the power loss characteristics of GaN-based DC-AC inverters for motor drive applications. The study includes circuit-level simulations and thermal-electrical co-modeling. Switching behavior is analyzed using detailed waveform modeling, and the impact of gate drive parameters, parasitics. Furthermore, a system level loss analysis based on thermos-electrical models is carried out for the entire frequency converter. The variations of the loss components (rectifier, inverter and passives) with respect to the motor load and speed changes are investigated and the impact of cooling on conduction losses is highlighted. The results show that GaN devices significantly reduce total power losses compared to silicon-based solutions, particularly under light-load conditions where switching losses dominate. These findings establish GaN-based inverters as an efficient and scalable solution for next-generation motor drive applications."

This study evaluates the effectiveness of these architectures in generating musical note patterns using a reduced dataset of 130 classical MIDI files, reflecting real-world constraints commonly encountered in Information Systems (IS) environments. To ensure comparability, models were trained under identical conditions and evaluated quantitatively through loss, accuracy, and F1 score, as well as qualitatively through visual inspection using MuseScore. The results showed that LSTM achieved the best overall performance, attaining the highest F1 scores across training durations (0.2176 at 10 epochs, 0.3726 at 15 epochs, and 0.6737 at 30 epochs). GRU exhibited faster training and comparable melodic generation, though with slightly lower metric performance. Transformer models, while powerful in data-rich contexts, performed poorly under small-data conditions, achieving low accuracy and slow convergence. This work adopts a Design Science Research (DSR) lens by treating these models as design artifacts and contributes to the IS domain through insights into lightweight, generative components for creative systems operating under resource limitations."

    "abstract": "This article presents a two-step incremental analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that achieves high resolution and energy efficiency while substantially easing the input driving constraints and interstage gain variation. By employing a level-shifted sub-ranging architecture with an input-tracking (IT) feature, the design obviates direct input sampling, thereby significantly relaxing the demands on the input driver. A gain-error-and-noise suppression (GENS) technique further enhances robustness to interstage gain variation through compact and hardware-efficient switched-capacitor (SC) operations. The prototype ADC fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS achieves a 92.1-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 50-kHz bandwidth. With fully dynamic operation, the power consumption is only <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$44.8~{\\mu }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>W, resulting in a Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) of 182.6 dB. The proposed ADC demonstrates competitive performance for low-power, high-precision, and multiplexable sensing in wearable, implantable, and edge AI applications."

However, existing designs often sacrifice power efficiency for higher data rates due to architectural limitations, neglecting optimization for low-power applications. To address this issue, we propose a receiver architecture that substantially enhances power efficiency through three key techniques. First, we improve the gain-bandwidth product (GBW) by employing an autonomous gain scheduling analog front-end (AFE) that dynamically tunes the gain while reducing drive current. Second, we reduce clocking overhead by introducing a self-monitoring interferometric deserializer that enables clock-free pre-scaling and halves the DDR sampling frequency. Third, we increase transition speed and minimize short-circuit power by utilizing a chaotic topological flow actuator (CTFA) with multi-path current feedthrough. Compared to prior state-of-the-art designs, the proposed receiver achieves a power efficiency of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$50~\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>W/Gbps/lane (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$42~\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>A/Gbps/lane), reducing power and current consumption by 46% and 45%, respectively, using a standard 180-nm process."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of vision-based autonomous driving technology, pedestrian detection have become an important component for improving traffic safety and driving system robustness. Nevertheless, in complex traffic scenarios, conventional pose estimation approaches frequently fail to accurately reconstruct occluded keypoints, primarily due to obstructions caused by vehicles, vegetation, or architectural elements. To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time occluded pedestrian pose completion framework termed Separation and Dimensionality Reduction-based Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (SDR-GAIN). Unlike previous approaches that train visual models to distinguish occlusion patterns, SDR-GAIN aims to learn human pose directly from the numerical distribution of keypoint coordinates and interpolate missing positions. It employs a self-supervised adversarial learning paradigm to train lightweight generators with residual structures for the imputation of missing pose keypoints. Additionally, it integrates multiple pose standardization techniques to alleviate the difficulty of the learning process. Experiments conducted on the COCO and JAAD datasets demonstrate that SDR-GAIN surpasses conventional machine learning and Transformer-based missing data interpolation algorithms in accurately recovering occluded pedestrian keypoints, while simultaneously achieving microsecond-level real-time inference."

    "abstract": "Wide-area oscillation events can cause severe disruption to energy production and delivery in power systems. The use of data-driven approaches for oscillation detection and source location is gaining significant attention in power system studies. However, such oscillation events are rare, and detailed system recordings are not publicly accessible. They are mostly anonymously shared with the community, which makes it challenging to study and analyze the different scenarios of forced oscillation events. The lack of detailed system recordings from oscillation events has been a serious shortcoming in developing data-driven methods for oscillation analysis. This work has created an extensive set of time-stamped forced oscillation datasets called “Dataset for Power SYstem Forced Oscillation Responses (DPSYFOR)” (pronounced <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">decipher</i>) using realistic power grid models to leverage data availability with a wide range of forced oscillation frequencies and sources. A reduced-order model as well as a large-scale validated model, depicting the system conditions of the August 10, 1996, blackout of the Western American power grid, have been used to generate the oscillation datasets. This resource will significantly support the development of data-driven algorithms, particularly machine learning approaches, which have demonstrated considerable potential in the power industry for event detection and classification.

This article develops a modified set of governing equations for electromagneticthermal coupling based on the arbitrary LagrangianEulerian (ALE) dynamic mesh framework and applies them to the transient electromagnetic launch process. Additionally, a hybrid meshing strategy combining sliding and dynamic meshes is introduced, where sliding meshes are utilized for the armature region and the rail sections in contact with the armature, while dynamic meshes are applied to the remaining rail sections. This approach effectively balances computational accuracy and complexity, enabling precise real-time solutions for the multiphysics characteristics of transient and high-speed models. To validate the proposed method, numerical results from static meshes, single-physics simulations, and the modified multiphysics coupling solution are compared with experimental data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in achieving accurate and real-time multiphysics simulations of electromagnetic railgun launches."

Furthermore, we use the control barrier function method to guarantee that the collective can navigate around objects, through cluttered environments, and transport objects in between obstacles by exploiting global and local control methods.

These decentralized systems often require features such as weighted threshold issuance and tracing for elasticity of decision-making, fine-grained blindness for user privacy control, and issuer-hiding to reduce potential external threats. However, the latest advancements in anonymous credential schemes cannot meet all of these essential properties for blockchain systems. To address these challenges, we propose weighted threshold anonymous credentials with redactable fine-grained blind signature (WTAC). Firstly, by leveraging unlinkable redactable signatures (URS) and functional encryption techniques, our redactable fine-grained blind signature supports selective disclosure and permits credential issuers to learn a particular function value related to the attributes during issuance without revealing the actual attribute content. Secondly, we utilize weighted ramp secret-sharing (WRSS) and randomizable signatures to achieve weighted threshold anonymous credentials, which are issuer-hiding to both users and verifiers. Moreover, we provide a concrete construction instantiated by the Fiat-Shamir paradigm and demonstrate its application, a privacy-preserving auditable lending system in blockchain scenarios, achieving the integration of user privacy and regulatory compliance. Finally, we give a formal security proof of anonymity, fine-grained blindness, traceability, non-frameability, and issuer-hiding. Performance evaluation shows the practicability and efficiency of our proposed WTAC."

These stresses include exposure to high-frequency, high-slew-rate voltage pulses generated by (ultra) wide bandgap ((U)WBG) inverters and the varying sub-atmospheric pressures inherent to high-altitude environments. This study explores the influence of reduced atmospheric pressure on insulation lifetime under the application of rapid rise-time square wave voltages, focusing specifically on the susceptibility of motor windings to partial discharge phenomena in such conditions. A 1.5 kV bipolar square wave with a rise time of 50 ns was employed across a pressure range of 20 kPa to 101 kPa. Testing was conducted at three distinct frequencies to evaluate the role of frequency in insulation degradation and on different magnet wire configurations. Exponential data fitting was applied to model the relationship between atmospheric pressure and the degradation rate of insulation at different frequencies quantitatively. The results underscore the synergistic challenges posed by high-frequency, high-slew-rate voltage pulses and low-pressure environments, emphasizing the necessity for advanced insulation designs. These findings are critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of motor winding systems in all-electric aircraft operating under these demanding conditions."

Our framework partitions LLMs into device-side frozen layers and server-side fine-tuning layers, where heterogeneous resource-constrained devices execute only forward propagation. To minimize server-side training costs, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the server-side layers. A pipeline parallelism strategy further optimizes training efficiency by decoupling device-server computations and leveraging decomposed backward propagation. SplitFrozen can also implement differential privacy and compression techniques for privacy preservation and transmission reduction. Experiments on GPT-2 with the MRPC, MNLI-matched, and SST-2 datasets demonstrate that SplitFrozen outperforms FedLoRA and SplitLoRA by 69.4% model accuracy under extremely imbalanced data, while reducing up to 86.8% device-side computations and 50.2% total training time.

This article presents the first measurement study of deployed DS2D technologies. Using crowdsourced mobile network data from the U.S. between October 2024 and July 2025, we provide evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and future evolution of DS2D technologies for extending mobile connectivity. We find a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed, the number of unique cell identifiers measured, and the volume of measurements, concentrated in accessible areas with poor terrestrial network coverage, such as national parks and sparsely populated counties. Stable physical- layer measurements were observed throughout the period, with a 24-dB lower median RSRP and a 3-dB higher RSRQ compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on the SINR measurements collected, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 3 Mb/s per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 18 Mb/s in the future, depending on key regulatory and business decisions, including allowable out-of-band emissions, permitted number of satellites, and availability of spectrum and orbital resources."

In this study, we propose OsteoFGRNet, a novel computational framework designed for early FGR detection using osteopontin-driven gene expression profiling. Unlike conventional methods that rely on limited clinical markers or static models, our approach integrates domain-specific biological knowledge with a multimodal deep learning architecture to capture both temporal dynamics and molecular interactions. OsteoFGRNet features three key components: a hierarchical feature extraction pipeline tailored for high-dimensional omics data, an attention-driven module that highlights biologically relevant biomarkers and developmental windows, and a graph-based propagation mechanism that encodes pathway-level dependencies informed by osteopontin expression. We incorporate multi-task optimization and biologically constrained regularization to enhance model robustness and interpretability. Extensive experiments on four benchmark molecular datasets demonstrate that OsteoFGRNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, achieving up to 91.02% accuracy on the Prenatal Growth Restriction dataset. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component in improving predictive power and biological relevance. Beyond prediction, the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into osteopontin-associated regulatory processes implicated in FGR pathogenesis. These results underscore the potential of OsteoFGRNet as a clinically meaningful tool for early risk stratification and mechanistic investigation of FGR. This work contributes a domain-aligned, interpretable, and high-performance solution to a critical problem in maternal-fetal medicine and opens new directions for multi-omics integration in prenatal diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have recently shown remarkable success in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). However, their applications, in practice, still face two significant challenges. First, although the multihead mechanism in self-attention improves model robustness during training, it may overlook the continuity of spectral bands. Second, existing methods often struggle to effectively balance global and local information during multiscale feature extraction, limiting further improvements in classification performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral-guided multiscale feature-aware Transformer (SMFAT) framework for HSIC. Specifically, a global low-rank spectral learning (GLSL) module is introduced to project hyperspectral image patches into a low-rank subspace, reducing spectral redundancy and capturing global spectral correlations. Furthermore, we introduce the multiscale feature-aware self-attention (MFASA) mechanism, which dynamically integrates fine- and coarse-grained features to enhance multiscale feature modeling. Finally, a spectral-guided fusion (SGF) module leverages the global spectral information extracted by the GLSL module to guide MFASA in more effectively capturing interspectral correlations and spectral continuity. This approach facilitates a more effective integration of spectral and spatial features in HSIs. Experiments on three well-known HSI datasets verify that the proposed SMFAT method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in real-world HSIC tasks.

Firstly, shallow features from individual modalities are extracted by a depthwise convolution layer combined with the transformer block. In the three parallel branches of the encoder, Cross Attention and Invertible Block (CAI) extracts local features and preserves high frequency texture details. Base Feature Extraction Module (BFE) captures long-range dependencies and enhances modality-shared information. Graph Reasoning Module (GR) is introduced to reason high-level cross-modality relations and simultaneously ex tract low-level detail features as CAI's modality-specific complementary information. Experiments demonstrate the competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods in visible/infrared image fusion and medical image fusion tasks. Moreover, the proposed algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of subsequent tasks, averagely scoring 8.27% mAP@0.5 higher in object detection and 5.85% mIoU higher in semantic segmentation."

    "abstract": "Accurately modeling complex spatial relationships is a pivotal challenge for Transformer-based object detectors, as existing models often rely on static positional encodings that fail to capture dynamic, real-world scene layouts. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel Dual-stream Geometric-aware Positional Encoding (DGPE) method. The proposed method innovatively designs two parallel streams to decouple and synergistically learn the explicit geometric priors and implicit contextual associations. This fused information is then projected onto a lightweight network to generate a content-aware dynamic attention bias, which actively guides the self-attention mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that DGPE improves the Average Precision (AP) of a strong baseline model by 1.4% on the challenging MS COCO benchmark without any additional inference cost. Furthermore, the method exhibited excellent generalization in applications such as industrial defect detection and remote sensing analysis, achieving a significant 16.4% AP gain on the NWPU VHR-10 dataset. This work provides a novel and efficient pathway for enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of object detectors, with proven generalization to industrial and remote sensing applications.

    "abstract": "This work presents a dual-point temperature sensing system capable of high-speed based on the photonic time-stretch dispersive Fourier transformation (TS-DFT) technique. The system aims to overcome the speed limitations of traditional optical spectrum interrogators. A sensing array consisting of two cascaded fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) with a 5-meter separation is illuminated by a 50 MHz femtosecond laser source. The reflected spectrum, encoded with temperature information, is then stretched in time by propagating through a dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) with a total dispersion of -360 ps/nm. This process enables the direct mapping of the optical spectrum into a measurable time-domain waveform at a 50 MHz repetition rate. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s capability to perform measurements over a broad temperature range from 40 °C to 250 °C. The temperature sensitivities of both FBGs were characterized to be 0.012 nm/°C in the optical wavelength domain. Correspondingly, the obtained time-domain sensitivities are -4.28 ps/°C and -4.31 ps/°C, with a temperature resolution of approximately 5.8 °C in the time domain. This study validates the feasibility of the TS-DFT scheme for high-speed dual-point sensing in demanding applications."

As one of the core methods,data completion uses the collected data to fill in the missing data. However, this approach inevitably poses significant privacy risks, since the traditional data completion methods require users' time and location information. In this paper, we propose a federated learning-based distributed data completion framework, which employs matrix factorization (MF) for local completion model training and federated learning to aggregate parameters of the MF model. This enables the construction of a global completion model without requiring private data, thereby mitigating privacy concerns. To address the challenges posed by the sparsity and asynchrony of distributed data, we incorporate time-aware deep neural network architectures with an asynchronous mechanism to enable federated training under irregularly gathered local data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high data completion accuracy while ensuring robust privacy protection."

The basic electromagnetic parameters of the SWS were calculated. The SWS circuit was designed, fabricated, and tested. Simulation results demonstrate flat dispersion characteristics and excellent transmission performance. The proposed SWS design features a simple assembly process and is compatible with mass-production. It comprises three key parts: a laser-cut double-layer molybdenum–rhenium (Mo–Re) sheet forming the meander grooves, upper and lower enclosures made of nickel–copper (Ni–Cu) alloy via computer numerical control (CNC) machining, and a Ni–Cu spacer layer fabricated by electric discharge machining (EDM). High-temperature hydrogen reduction and full-surface gold plating applied to the laser-cut Mo–Re sheets effectively reduce SWS transmission loss. Cold-test results show close agreement with simulations, demonstrating insertion loss of 0.058 dB/mm. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations reveal that the SWS achieves an output power of 65.8 W and a gain of 27.39dB at 39 GHz under 7.4 kV, 0.1 A electron beam parameters, with a 3-dB bandwidth of approximately 8 GHz."

This paper first introduces the traditional PSO algorithm and its limitations, then elaborates on the method of applying MOEDO principles to PSO, proposing an enhanced hybrid algorithm. By incorporating dynamic adaptation mechanisms, this improved algorithm enhances PSO's performance in changing environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs excellently on various dynamic test problems, showing robustness and efficiency. Firstly, three core 13 specific indicators are determined. The normalization method is applied to process the data. Subsequently, the model is constructed, and the Multi-Objective Exponential Distribution Optimizer (MOEDO) is utilized to solve and optimize the model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the Sobol index. The results show that the particle swarm optimization algorithm optimized by MOEDO has the best effect, with the objective function value reaching 83.1777. The key parameter values are determined, and factors such as the tourism tax parameter and the proportion of environmental protection expenditure have a significant impact on the sustainable development of tourism. This study provides an effective tool for accurate evaluation and scientific decisionmaking for tourist destinations, helps balance the goals of economic, environmental, and social development, and holds important theoretical and practical significance for promoting the sustainable development of global tourism."

A Laravel 12.x test application was deployed in Docker containers, and its performance was measured using Apache JMeter on two API endpoints representing different data retrieval workloads. The primary metrics analysed include average response time, throughput, and CPU and memory resource utilisation. The results indicate that on the endpoint with a large data processing load, both deployment architectures exhibited low performance and reached the capacity limits of computational resources, suggesting the primary bottleneck resides at the application level. However, on the endpoint with a lighter workload per request, FrankenPHP significantly outperformed PHP-FPM + Nginx regarding response time and throughput, supported by percentile analysis showing more stable performance under peak load. Nevertheless, FrankenPHP was recorded to have higher memory consumption. This study concludes that FrankenPHP offers potential performance improvements for specific workloads in Laravel applications on Docker, but it is essential to consider the trade-off with memory usage. These findings provide empirical insights for developers and engineers when selecting deployment architectures."

In this study, we designed a transposed convolution module using Verilog HDL, built with a modular and parallel structure. We implemented it on an FPGA and used advanced extensible interface to connect the Processing System and Programmable Logic. The hardware showed faster processing than software, especially as the clock frequency increased. This result shows the potential of hardware-based transposed convolution for building faster deep learning systems."

This paper presents an advanced modeling approach for twelve-phase permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) that addresses the heavy cross-coupling limitations in conventional multi-star methods. The approach extends multi-three-phase PMSM modeling to a twelve-phase (4×3-phase) configuration with sinusoidal EMF, demonstrating effective DC voltage regulation in PWM rectifierfed DC networks. A key contribution is the seamless fault tolerance capability, where the system maintains stability under open-phase faults by dynamically reconfiguring the transformation matrix from twelve-phase to nine-phase (3×3-phase) operation through isolation of the defective winding module. The approach preserves modular control advantages using conventional three-phase converter structures while ensuring continuous operation under fault conditions, making it suitable for critical applications requiring high reliability."

This study presents a comparative evaluation of two modern deep learning models—EfficientNetB1 and ConvNeXtTiny—for automated CAD detection using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) images. A total of 4,705 CCTA images from 500 patients were utilized, categorized into positive and negative classes. Preprocessing steps included image normalization, one-hot encoding, and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming. Both models were trained using transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to enhance performance and generalization. The results show that EfficientNetB1 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.37%, with balanced precision and recall across both classes. In comparison, ConvNeXtTiny reached an accuracy of 94.66%, showing slightly lower performance but with the benefit of reduced computational cost and faster inference time. The findings indicate that EfficientNetB1 is more suitable when accuracy is prioritized, while ConvNeXtTiny is a viable alternative in resource-constrained clinical environments. This study contributes to the field of medical image analysis by offering practical guidance for selecting appropriate deep learning models for CAD diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Hotel sanitation management is a series of structured efforts to ensure that all facilities and services in a hotel meet established hygiene and health standards. The goal is to prevent the spread of disease, maintain environmental quality, and improve guest satisfaction. Sanitation management in hotels is a crucial aspect of the hospitality industry that aims to maintain the cleanliness, health, and comfort of guests and staff. The issue lies in the lack of real-time sanitation monitoring features in the current hotel system. This makes it difficult for management to immediately identify and respond to areas that require cleaning or sanitation repair. Therefore, hotel sanitation management requires a system that provides transparent and valid information. Blockchain technology has a peer-to-peer validation feature that ensures all transaction information related to hotel sanitation is transparent and valid. Each transaction must be validated by all participants before being stored on the blockchain network. Thus, the purpose of this research is to build a hybrid blockchain model to improve the transparency of hotel sanitation. The research employs a qualitative methodology, utilizing a comprehensive literature review. The research output is in the form of a proposed model and a simulation with Hyperledger fabrics. Based on simulation results with Hyperledger Fabric, every transaction related to hotel sanitation must be validated by all nodes in the blockchain network. This condition ensures that the information generated by the blockchain-based system is transparent and valid."

This research explores how blockchain technology adoption (BTA) shapes supply chain integration (SCI) and drives sustainable supply chains performance (SSCP). It also explores the moderating role of Government Support and Policies (GSP) in these relationships. This study gathered data from 76 companies of medium and large size operating in Thailand’s food and beverage sector. The analysis shows that BTA contributes positively to both SCI and SSCP. In notably, SCI appears to play an essential role in linking BTA to improved sustainability outcomes. The research also observed that GSP can reinforce the connection between BTA and SSCP, especially when such support is substantial. On the other hand, GSP did not exhibit a significant influence on the relationship between SCI and SSCP. Collectively, these results underscore the importance of combining technological adoption, integration strategies, and supportive public policies to enhance sustainability in Thailand’s key food industry, a sector underpinning the national economy."

    "abstract": "Distributed learning (DL) is gaining popularity as it enables clients (e.g., AI Agents) to enhance their machine learning (ML) models’ performance by exchanging knowledge without revealing private datasets. State-of-the-art DL approaches primarily focus on transferring knowledge between heterogeneous clients with diverse model architectures, connecting clients with those that can improve their models, and protecting data privacy. However, they overlook the threat of malicious clients that potentially downgrade the models’ performance by sharing inaccurate knowledge or excluding high-performing clients from the training procedure.Therefore, we introduce the Zero-Knowledge Blockchain-Based Knowledge Distillation Learning Framework (zkBKD). In zkBKD, heterogeneous clients communicate with a blockchain network to discover high-performing clients, verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure the correctness of the knowledge shared from other clients, and vote to eliminate malicious clients. We analyze security and privacy risks and show that zkBKD prevents membership, poisoning, and collusion attacks. We conduct extensive experiments on two standard datasets across heterogeneous clients with four model architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that zkBKD relatively improves the average model accuracy of all clients by 25.71%. Even lightweight models such as ResNet-2 achieve up to a 103.35% accuracy gain compared to independent training."

The most common complications include hypotension and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Traditional hemodialysis monitoring methods cannot detect physiological changes in real time. Wearable abdominal sound detection devices can monitor intestinal activity, including bowel sounds, in real time. AbSound integrates multimodal physiological parameters through signal analysis and provides personalized health management recommendations tailored to individual needs. In hemodialysis patients, six-month changes in TNF-α and CRP levels were closely associated with PEW. AbSound improves physical function and nutritional status in patients with chronic inflammation. AbSound is a potential application of wearable abdominal sound devices for reducing complications associated with hemodialysis. AbSound proposes a new model that combines dietary management and health monitoring to improve patients' quality of life and cognitive function. We used AbSound's product-moment correlation method to examine the relationship between health indicators and overall quality of life in hemodialysis patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of abdominal sounds on the intake response in patients with endstage renal disease (ESRD). AbSound monitoring of health indicators and quality of life in hemodialysis patients is precise."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of the prostate gland in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for computer-assisted diagnosis, treatment planning, and radiotherapy in prostate cancer management. Segmentation also enables robust extraction of quantitative MRI features-such as shape, texture, and intensity pat-terns-that are important for risk stratification and multimodal integration with biomarkers. However, anatomical variability and indistinct gland boundaries present major challenges. In this work, we propose a prostate segmentation framework based on U-Net, incorporating a novel hybrid loss strategy that combines the Dice loss, binary cross-entropy (BCE), and a boundary-aware term to refine gland contours, particularly. Additionally, we introduce a curriculum weighting scheme that dynamically adjusts the relative contributions of Dice and BCE during training, stabilising early convergence and enhancing boundary delineation in later stages. Experiments conducted on a publicly available annotated prostate MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive Dice similarity coefficients and intersection-over-union scores, with improved accuracy at apical and basal regions compared to standard hybrid losses. This study highlights the effectiveness of hybrid loss innovation for prostate segmentation. It provides a reproducible benchmark that facilitates reliable MRI feature extraction for downstream research on prostate cancer prediction and early, non-invasive detection"

This quasi experimental study evaluated the effectiveness of a culturally localized guided reading program—anchored in the nine-level Amrita Levelled Books framework and supported by a mobile learning appin accelerating early literacy among Grade K-1 student in rural India. Sixty intervention students received two 60minute small-group sessions per week over one term, whereas sixty matched controls followed the standard curriculum. After three weeks, 38 % of the participants in the intervention group advanced from Level 1 to Level 2, whereas 0 % of those in the control group did. Growth curve modeling revealed weekly gains of 11 % in sight-word accuracy for the intervention group versus 3 % for the control group (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{p}&lt;.001$</tex>), and end-of-term t tests revealed medium effect sizes (Hedges’ <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{g} \\approx 0.60-0.75, \\mathrm{p}&lt;0.01)$</tex> for improvements in letter-sound mastery and oral-reading fluency. These findings demonstrate that just two hours per week of level-matched, culturally responsive instruction can rapidly enhance decoding and fluency skills, contributing to effective early learning outcomes, as outlined in SDG 4.1.1. The approach offers valuable insights into scaling inclusive, data-driven literacy programs in similarly underserved settings across the Global South and beyond."

    "abstract": "Customer churn remains a significant challenge in subscription-based industries, particularly in telecommunications, where contractual structures and usage dynamics directly influence revenue outcomes. SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management (BRIM), through its core components Subscription Order Management (SOM) and Convergent Charging (CC) captures these contractual and behavioral signals. This study develops a machine learning (ML) framework for churn prediction by using publicly available telecom datasets to reflect SAP BRIM's data structures. Contractual attributes (tenure, contract type, service bundles) and usage-related billing events (charges, discounts, consumption volumes) were operationalized as predictive features. Four machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, LightGBM and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were trained and evaluated. The results show that the MLP classifier achieved the best performance, with a test accuracy of 78 %, precision of 83 %, recall of 89 % for churn class, and micro F1-score of 70 %, outperforming Random Forest (test accuracy 77.5%) and XGBoost (test accuracy 77.4 %). Feature analysis identified tenure, contract type, and billing anomalies as key predictors of churn. The results show that telecom data can be meaningfully adapted to BRIM contexts, enabling the use of AI-driven churn prediction within enterprise billing workflows."

Three correction scenarios were evaluated under identical simulation settings: no correction (S0), local correction using true ASF values (S1), and wide-area correction using a single reference station value (S2). Simulation results show that S1 consistently achieved the lowest positioning errors, while S0 exhibited the largest errors with extensive high-error regions. S2 provided limited improvements near the reference station but degraded with increasing distance and ASF spatial gradients. The findings highlight that local ASF correction significantly improves eLoran positioning performance, whereas wide-area correction has only localized benefits."

    "abstract": "Deep models for retinal fundus analysis often depend on handcrafted preprocessing (e.g., CLAHE, background division) that is dataset-specific and costly to tune. We propose a Frequency Modulating Network (FMN), a parameter-efficient, plug-and-play module that operates in the Fourier domain using soft radial band masks (Gaussian/RBF) and a residual, mean-preserving gate. FMN can be placed either (i) before the backbone as a learnable, end-to-end preprocessing block (image space) or (ii) after high-level stages as a feature-refinement block (feature space). On the APTOS 2019 five-grade diabetic retinopathy benchmark, across CNN (ResNet-18/50) and ViT backbones, FMN consistently improves accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1, and macro-AUC while adding only a single FFT/iFFT pair per insertion and negligible parameters. An ablation on the number of radial bands shows a U-shaped trend, with moderate band counts performing best. A comparison with hand-crafted pipelines (stochastic augmentations, CLAHE, Ben-Graham) finds FMN competitive or superior without task-specific tuning. Notably, an input-conditioned variant—where band gains are generated from the input image—underperforms the unconditioned FMN, suggesting that per-image modulation can overfit sample-specific quirks, whereas the unconditioned FMN learns a global task/domain-level spectral regularizer that generalizes more robustly."

Parkinson's disease, a leading contributor to disability in older adults, demands coordinated, accessible, and sustained care. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the standard of care for Parkinson's Disease in Kazakhstan and the United States, highlighting how national healthcare systems-one evolving within a state-funded primary care model, the other shaped by a specialized, insurance-based framework-address diagnosis, treatment access, multidisciplinary management, and long-term support. By examining epidemiological data, health system structures, and policy landscapes, the authors of this work have identified key gaps and opportunities in both countries. This work analyzes seven key dimensions of comparative health systems; Reimbursement Models, Regulatory Framework, Cost and Efficiency, Access and Coverage, Quality of Care, Health Outcomes, and Sociocultural and Economic Context- to generate actionable insights for health planning. Ultimately, the findings from this study are intended to inform the design of low-cost, wearable health solutions that are equitable, scalable, and responsive to the diverse needs of patients across settings-particularly in resource-limited environments."

    "abstract": "Exam anxiety is a prevalent concern among university students, adversely affecting their academic performance, mental health, and overall well-being. This study investigates the efficacy of an AI-assisted music therapy intervention specifically designed to alleviate anxiety during exam periods. We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial involving 150 participants, wherein the intervention group received personalized music playlists generated in real-time based on facial emotion recognition data. In contrast, the control group engaged in passive listening to pre-defined playlists that lacked personalization. The primary outcome was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, which participants completed both before and after the intervention. Statistical analysis revealed a significant reduction in GAD-7 scores for the intervention group (Mean: 6.0, SD: 2.4) compared to the control group (Mean: 11.5, SD: 2.2), resulting in a large effect size (Cohen’s d=1.9). Participants in the intervention group also reported enhanced emotional engagement and satisfaction during their sessions. These findings suggest that AI-assisted music therapy is not only effective in reducing exam anxiety but also highlights the potential for using technology to create personalized therapeutic experiences. This innovative approach can be an important contribution to mental health strategies aimed at supporting students during critical academic periods, paving the way for future research in the field of digital therapeutics."

The study compared two deep learning networks, DeepLabV3+ and U-Net, and their performance in classifying cloudy and clear skies. The study made use of datasets from Kaggle, which gave images of high quality necessary for training and testing the models. The performance of DeepLabV3+ compared with U-Net indicated a higher performance with a 91.5% Intersection over Union (IoU) and accuracy of 96.3%, accompanied with training and validation losses of 12.45 and 14.72, respectively. This study demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy in segmentation of clouds, hence more accurate assessments in the field of remote sensing. The motivation for this research stems from the need to enhance cloud segmentation in satellite images, a component that is central to a wide range of remote sensing applications. Clouds can obscure vital information, leading to data insufficiency and inaccuracies in environmental monitoring, land-use evaluation, and disaster management. By advancing segmentation techniques, this research aims to make contributions towards more reliable satellite-derived data, thus enabling better decision-making in scientific and industrial applications."

    "abstract": "This study examines the influence of visual hierarchy, banner blindness, and selective attention on user interactions with search adverts on Tokopedia, a prominent e-commerce site in Indonesia. As digital advertising emerges as a pivotal revenue generator for Tokopedia, comprehending user interaction with advertisements is essential for augmenting efficacy and refining user experience. The study is based on behavioral economics, elucidating how cognitive biases and emotional elements affect user behavior in a multifaceted digital landscape. The study use qualitative screencast videography to investigate the influence of visual design elements and cognitive processes on user attention and decision-making. Although visual hierarchy (e.g., contrast, size, alignment) directs attention, the perception of stimuli is more crucial in fostering engagement. Banner blindness arises from cognitive filtering, wherein people unconsciously disregard advertisements perceived as irrelevant. Moreover, selective attention affects purchasing decisions as consumers prefer advertisements that match with their objectives. The results underscore the necessity for a comprehensive strategy in advertisement design, integrating emotional resonance, contextual significance, and multi-sensory components. Recommendations for Tokopedia encompass tailored, adaptive advertising forms that diminish cognitive load and augment relevance to user intent. This study enhances digital marketing by utilizing behavioral economics to refine e-commerce advertisements. Subsequent research may enhance these findings by cross-platform investigations, eye-tracking, and neuroimaging to investigate the behavioral dynamics of internet advertising."

In this regard, an IoT-based digital weighing system that is connected to a smartphone application is developed. It consists of a NodeMCU ESP32 microcontroller, load cells, and a digital weighing indicator that communicates via RS232 port. Voltage levels are matched through an RS232-to-TTL adapter. The mobile application is designed to be used in an offline mode, therefore suitable for locations with low connectivity. The result of field test was the average measurement of 138.43 kg (digital) and 142.79 kg (traditional), with the total deviation of 832.45 kg, and MAPE was of 7.19%. Results show an increase in the accuracy and operational ability. Although there are still challenges for user adaptation, the measuring mode becomes a two-button operation which will become an interesting alternative of the manual weighing system. Thanks to its IoT functionality, the system increases the weighing precision without complications for the user. Manual to digital can be incremental to actual conditions. More empirical verification is necessary to improve the accuracy and the implementation of this type of system."

Robotaxis, an innovative mode of transportation that integrates robotics and artificial intelligence, are anticipated to become widely used, thereby revolutionizing urban mobility. This work proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming model for robotaxi dispatch. Unlike previous approaches, it can recommend passengers’ pick-up points, drop-off points, and boarding time (BT) that may deviate from their initial origins, destinations, and BT, respectively. It encourages passengers to accept the recommended pick-up and drop-off (UO) points or to be picked up slightly earlier or later. The objectives are to maximize the profit per kilometer of robotaxis and to minimize the total travel expense of passengers. Subsequently, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with mass center (NSGA-MC) is proposed to solve the model. It outperforms nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) across several metrics. Some instances provide detailed results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, comparing scenarios with and without UO-point and boarding-time recommendations. An experiment is also conducted to examine various recommendation acceptance rates, demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model in developing intelligent public transportation systems."

To this end, this study proposes a system that recognizes lanes in real-time using the one-stage object detection model YOLOv8 and generates and follows a driving path based on this recognition. The entire system is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS2), with perception, path planning, and motion planning modules designed as independent nodes to ensure flexibility and scalability. The proposed system provides a stable foundation for adding complex scenarios such as dynamic obstacle avoidance and traffic light recognition in the future. Its performance is verified through driving tests in a closed-loop track environment."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the role of technology-driven approaches in facilitating sustainable transitions in urban development. Using the case of Hammarby Sjöstad in Stockholm, we analyze the implementation of eleven sustainable technologies and examine their impact on the broader transition process. Existing literature often frames sustainability transitions in terms of social, technical, or socio-technical approaches. Our findings suggest that a successful technical innovation approach constitutes a well-crafted strategy for managing the supply and demand sides of innovation throughout the extended phases of the innovation journey. Technological advances alone are insufficient: successful transitions also require active engagement from the demand side, including market actors, institutional stakeholders, and consumers, at specific stages. Our study highlights the interaction between the supply side (push), which drives technological innovation, and the demand side (pull), which determines adoption, acceptance, and long-term viability. We identify three recurring mechanisms—infrastructural compatibility, demand-side catalysts, and institutional resistance—that explain when and why technology-driven approaches succeed or fail. The findings emphasize the need to align new technologies with broader systems, ensuring they are not only technically feasible but also institutionally supported and socially desirable. We propose a more nuanced and comprehensive perspective than that of prior transition research, arguing that technological, social, and socio-technical approaches all play essential roles throughout the transition process. Additionally, we contribute to innovation policy and transition management research by demonstrating how the interaction between supply and demand influences the outcomes of sustainability initiatives. Also, we respond to calls for greater attention to the demand side of innovation, offering insights that can inform policymakers and technology developers working toward sustainable change. Our research provides a strategic framework for understanding the conditions under which technology-driven transitions can succeed in practice."

    "abstract": "The use of the Internet by robots is referred to as the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). IoRT is expected to enable robots to create innovative services by effectively utilizing information and resources previously inaccessible when robots were offline. An IoRT system is a complex structure comprising multiple layers, including field-side systems (such as robot systems), cloud-side systems, and the Internet-based communication infrastructure connecting them. Middleware, platforms, and communication protocols differ across layers depending on purpose, further increasing system complexity. When exchanging data between layers with different protocols, a data conversion mechanism is required. If this conversion bridge is provided separately, additional communication overhead occurs, reducing overall performance. To address this issue, we integrated a new communication interface using MQTT, the de facto standard IoT protocol, into RT-Middleware, one of the established middleware frameworks for constructing robotic systems. This integration enables the development of Internet-connected robotic systems entirely within RT-Middleware, eliminating the need for external bridges. In such IoRT systems, the boundaries between layers are removed, and the entire structure functions as a unified middleware-based system. We evaluated the communication performance of IoRT systems seamlessly constructed on RT-Middleware against ROS1- and ROS2-based IoRT systems that require an IoT bridge. Latency measurements revealed that for small- and medium-sized payloads, the IoT bridge accounted for up to 40% of the total system latency. These results demonstrate that IoRT systems built with RT-Middleware, without relying on an IoT bridge, achieve lower latency and better support real-time performance."

    "abstract": "The need for environmentally conscious alternatives to traditional road transport is progressively growing as digital marketplaces continue to integrate more deeply into our daily lives. Employing drones for parcel delivery is a possible solution to mitigating road traffic and pollution. Nevertheless, designing an efficient drone delivery system comes with numerous challenges, including planning efficient scheduling of delivery tasks and coping with the strong impact that weather conditions have on drones' mobility. We consider a drone delivery service based on a distributed infrastructure of service stations that a fleet of drones can use for battery replacement, allowing long-distance deliveries. We formulate the problem of scheduling the drone fleet's operations so as to minimize the completion time of the delivery tasks and propose an approximation algorithm called REDMAT. Our algorithm enables a straightforward extension to consider real-time demands and variable wind conditions, based on a thorough mathematical model, and that we simulate in our experiments. We simulate our solutions under numerous experimental settings, including dynamic scenarios with online delivery demand arrivals, and variable wind conditions, and compare the achieved performance against other existing solutions. Our experiments show the superior efficiency of our algorithm, which provides a remarkable improvement in the makespan (i.e., the maximum delivery time) and average delivery completion time, respectively up to 40% and up to 24.5% with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions."

Base station (BS) filtering is applied to the Cluster Delay Line (CDL) channel model, which results in rapid fluctuations in the propagation environment at the user equipment (UE) side during the BM procedure. Two novel approaches-approach A and approach B-are proposed to emulate the instantaneous multi-beam channel environment, with approach A suitable for emulating random target beams and approach B for pre-defined ones, respectively. Both approaches are based on the Beam Power-Angular-Spectrum Similarity Percentage (BPSP), a new metric introduced to evaluate the channel accuracy of reconstruction. Simulations and experimental results are presented to validate the accuracy of the channel reconstruction. Furthermore, the performance of an actual AI model deployed at the UE side is evaluated using the proposed methodology."

Real-time performance, standardization, and scalability of healthcare networks are impacted by having various categories of devices, changing workloads, and changing resource requirements. This paper suggests a new AI-based method for standardized 6G healthcare systems, referred to as the Cognitive Autonomous Resource and Edge Collaboration Framework (CARE-6G). The use of cognitive AI agents together with edge-cloud cooperation in CARE-6G enables automated prediction, allocation, and optimization of computing, storage, and networking resources. The framework is constructed hierarchically such that edge nodes perform low-latency processing, while cloud infrastructure performs big-scale analytics. AI-based predictive orchestration ensures that the needs for workloads and healthcare services can shift. The experiments indicated that CARE-6G is 35% quicker, 30% more resource-efficient, and 27% more reliable than the existing practices. When compared to the best methods available, CARE-6G was 39% faster, 30% better at using resources, 27% more reliable, 25% less power-hungry, and 15% better at getting things done."

In this work, the radiating patch is shared by the L- and S-band for the first time to realize left-handed CP (LHCP) and right-handed CP (RHCP), respectively. The dual-band operation for each polarization is realized by introducing intensive mutual coupling between the radiator and the resonator through the slots in the ground. The dual CPs in the two bands are achieved by combining the two orthogonal polarizations of the same band using a power divider with a 90° phase difference. To improve the cross-band isolations, two groups of split-ring resonators (SRRs) with different resonances are adopted. Besides, the analysis method of equivalent circuit is adopted to investigate the mechanism of the proposed design. Based on the element design, a four-element phased array is developed and a self-rotating method is analyzed and used to improve the axial ratio (AR) performance. The 1 × 4 L/S-band dual-CP shared aperture phased array is prototyped and verified, demonstrating the impedance bandwidths from 1.67 to 1.76 GHz and from 2.11 to 2.29 GHz for the L-band and S-band operation, respectively. The 3-dB AR bandwidths for the L/S-bands are 1.68-1.75 GHz and 2.17-2.24 GHz, respectively. The measured results also show a good beam scanning ability of ±50° in both bands with a scanning loss of about 3 dB."

    "abstract": "This work delves into an optimal hybrid transmission strategy for remote state estimation (RSE), where some smart sensors observe various systems and transmit their local state estimates to a remote estimator. Inspired by the high bandwidth of a high-frequency (HF) link alongside the robust reliability and low energy consumption of a low-frequency (LF) link, a novel hybrid transmission strategy is proposed. This strategy allows smart sensors to utilize either the HF link or the LF link dynamically, each with distinct channel characteristics and energy consumption. To achieve highly reliable and energy-efficient transmission, it is imperative to devise an optimal transmission scheduling strategy that dictates the selection of the link and channel allocation. Formulating this challenge as a Markov decision process (MDP), a sufficient condition ensuring the existence of an optimal deterministic and stationary (ODS) policy is established. The structural characteristics of the optimal policy are derived. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, specifically the dueling double deep <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>-network (D3QN) algorithm, is employed to approximate the optimal policy.

To this end, the real system is run with arbitrary control input and the resulting data is saved. Based on the nominal model of the system and the collected data, uncertainty affecting the state transition is estimated by a Gauss-Newton method offline. Then, the used control input and the estimated uncertainty are used to train the Gaussian process which generates the mean and variance of the uncertainty. Online, the gap between the nominal and real dynamics is compensated by the trained GP. In other words, the nominal model is refined using the estimated uncertainty mean, while the estimated uncertainty variance is directly incorporated into the RA-MPPI framework, eliminating the need to manually tune the disturbance covariance parameter. Validation is conducted through simulation experiments in Gazebo using a F1TENTH car with a bicycle model navigating a track with and without obstacles. Also, real-world performance is further demonstrated on the F1TENTH car platform driving the same track under similar conditions. Across both simulation and real-world scenarios, the proposed method demonstrates improved safety and trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline MPPI and RA-MPPI techniques in terms of lap times and the number of crash-free lap completions.

Cell-free MIMO, which has been regarded as a key technology for enhancing the performance of the next-generation wireless communication systems, leverages the collective capability of multiple distributed access points (APs), allowing collaboration between them. However, optimizing cell-free MIMO can pose challenges for centralized optimization schemes. In particular, complexities associated with the joint optimizations of user-transmission assignment and transmission precoding, two factors which are of much importance for determining the quality-of-service, grow with the number of APs and served users. To this end, a unified scheme employing distributed QNNs is used to optimize downlink transmitter-user assignment and transmit precoding with the goal of maximizing the achieved sum rate. Firstly, the cloud processing unit, which holds holistic information about the particular wireless communication network, employs QNN to assign each AP to its designated mobile terminal. Secondly, the edge processing units, which are computed in proximity relative to the AP in order to reduce latency, estimate transmission precoding for their corresponding APs. Moreover, numerical results are presented to showcase the performance of the proposed protocol."

    "abstract": "As a critical statistical technique in oncology, survival prediction is used to estimate the probability of survival or time-to-event outcomes. Identifying survival-related factors from pathology and genomic data is a key approach for analyzing survival outcomes. However, current methods face several challenges, such as the suboptimal adaptation of pre-trained vision foundation models to specific tasks during feature extraction from whole slide images (WSIs), and the fact that many pathology-based models fail to integrate repetitive gene expression information during pre-training. In this study, we propose a plug-and-play multiple instance learning (MIL)-based foundation model tuning strategy to adapt vision foundation models for downstream tasks and incorporate knowledge from genomic data. Specifically, we introduce Task-specific Instance Selection, which utilizes zero-shot learning to efficiently select task-relevant WSI regions, improving tuning efficiency and reducing interference from irrelevant tissue areas. Additionally, we develop a multi-model prompt token for model fine-tuning, which integrates genetic information into the prompt-tuning process and transfers new modality information to pre-trained vision foundation models. To further enhance the model's ability to learn genetic information during fine-tuning, we introduce a Gene Distribution Aware Task as an auxiliary task to the traditional survival task. This auxiliary task helps the model better perceive multimodal information. Extensive experimental results on three public TCGA datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all previous MIL-based methodologies and fine-tuning approaches in terms of performance."

First, a fully distributed estimator is designed to asymptotically estimate the leader’s states with nonzero input under event-triggered communication. Next, novel filters are introduced to compensate for unmeasured velocity information in the presence of DAF, and output feedback fault-tolerant controllers are developed to ensure asymptotic consensus tracking despite the faults of actuators. Each robot in the considered multi-WMR system is equipped with two controllers that are co-designed in a unified framework. The final control laws are obtained by solving a set of equations, for which the existence of a unique solution is rigorously established. The proposed scheme not only enables output feedback control under partial loss-of-effectiveness (PLOE) faults in dual actuators, but also ensures fully distributed consensus tracking with event-triggered communication. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in remote sensing imagery (RSI) analysis. However, their sensitivity to adversarial perturbations remains a critical bottleneck for their deployment in security-sensitive scenarios. Currently, most mainstream adversarial purification methods focus on pixel space example reconstruction, neglecting the effective recovery of deep semantic features and the classification decision space, thereby failing to mitigate the adversarial attacks adequately. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal adversarial purification framework, Leveraging Learnable Defense Prompts and a one-step diffusion model (LDP-Diff), which aims to achieve robust adversarial defense with semantic consistency. Firstly, we introduce a learnable defense prompt (LDP) mechanism in LDP-Diff. Through the learnable optimization of input prompts, LDP-Diff can provide precise semantic guidance for the purification process. Next, we introduce a One-Step Diffusion Model combined with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for lightweight fine-tuning, significantly reducing the inference complexity while effectively removing adversarial perturbations and achieving high-quality structural and semantic reconstruction. Moreover, to further enhance the stability of purified examples in the classification space, we propose a entropy-guided logit fusion (EGLF) loss, which quantifies the confidence entropy and adaptively fuses the logit distributions between examples to alleviate the class bias remaining in the classification space after reconstruction. Comprehensive experimental results show that LDP-Diff exhibits excellent defense capabilities in multiple RSI datasets. LDP-Diff achieves an accuracy improvement of 2.40% on the UCM dataset and realizes a significant performance improvement of 10.84% on the AID dataset compared to the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Notably, LDP-Diff exhibits excellent robustness, generalization, computational efficiency, and significant advantages in cross-domain defense."

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision that underpins many higher-level tasks. Previous VOT methods have explored various approaches to improve the performance of VOT tasks and achieve predetermined goals. However, due to the limitations of a single view, issues such as visual blind spots and glitches in photographic devices present insurmountable challenges, often causing the visual features of the tracked object to vanish entirely or partially. Providing supplementary images from another view is an effective way to improve tracking performance by eliminating blind spots and enhancing the reliability of image sources. In this work, we propose a novel benchmark called the Aerial and Ground Cooperation Dataset for VOT (AGVOT). AGVOT consists of 643 sequences from aerial and ground views, comprising 119,859 image pairs. These image pairs were collected from 15 scenes and span 26 object categories. Every sequence is strictly time-aligned and annotated with 4-point bounding boxes. For comprehensive evaluation, AGVOT is further categorized into 12 challenging attributes, each labeled at the frame level. Moreover, we introduce an Aerial and Ground Cooperation Tracking Network (AGTrack) to demonstrate dual-view feature integration and cross-view tracking cooperation. Extensive experiments show that AGTrack outperforms 10 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the computer vision community when tested on AGVOT’s dataset and its challenging attributes. These results demonstrate that implementing VOT tasks with cooperative views achieves more accurate and reliable tracking performance. The project source is available at the link."

The dual-mode version demonstrates low insertion loss, and the tri-mode configuration provides enhanced frequency selectivity and stopband suppression without additional matching networks. Both diplexers operate under four distinct states using a single circuit topology, offering high reconfigurability and substantial design flexibility for multi-band front-end integration. Fabricated on Rogers RO4003 substrates, the prototypes exhibit measured insertion losses of 0.47–1.02 dB and port-to-port isolation exceeding 25–38 dB, demonstrating strong advantages in selectivity, low-loss performance, and multi-state scalability. These results show that the proposed designs achieve an improved balance between frequency selectivity, low insertion loss, and reconfigurability, making them promising candidates for frequency-agile and reconfigurable multi-band communication front-ends."

However, current AI-based single-image classification models face a fundamental limitation: when applied to multiple tele-cervicography images from the same patient, they produce inconsistent predictions that create diagnostic uncertainty and undermine clinical confidence. To address this challenge, we present a temporal-aware, multi-image Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes multiple cervical images collectively, generating unified patient-level predictions using a five-class framework (Negative, Atypical, Positive 1, Positive 2, Positive 3). Our approach incorporates temporal embeddings to capture sequential relationships between images acquired during visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) examinations, enabling the model to leverage complementary information across the image sequence. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-image ViT-Huge variant achieves 70.4% accuracy when processing all patient images, outperforming single-image baselines and establishing temporal-enhanced Vision Transformer as an effective solution for reliable AI-assisted cervical cancer screening in resource-limited settings."

National statistics indicate that dermatological conditions rank third among the top ten outpatient diagnoses. Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases often requires expert evaluation and can be time-consuming, making early detection challenging for the general public. To address this issue, this study proposes a deep learning-based image recognition model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to facilitate rapid and accurate skin disease classification. A total of 3,890 dermatoscopic images encompassing four classes—Melanoma, Acne, Ringworm, and Normal Skin—were compiled from multiple sources. The dataset underwent pre-processing, augmentation, and class balancing. A modified VGG19 pre-trained model was fine-tuned using a transfer learning approach by adding two dense layers (1024 and 512 units, respectively) with dropout to mitigate overfitting. The model was trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Experimental results demonstrated high performance, achieving 98% across all key metrics, indicating robust classification capability. The outcomes suggest that the proposed CNN-based model provides a reliable and efficient diagnostic support tool for early skin disease detection and has potential for integration into clinical and teledermatology applications."

This paper presents a framework that continuously evolves with human patterns, validated through a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 4}$</tex>-month study across four major institutions involving <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4, 2 0 0}$</tex> participants. Our framework addresses key challenges in modern behavioral prediction by combining real-time adaptation with privacy-focused design. Through extensive testing in health-care, transportation, education, and manufacturing sectors, we demonstrate significant improvements in operational outcomes. The system's success stems from its ability to learn from daily interactions while protecting user privacy, offering a practical and ethical solution for real-world applications where human behavior prediction is critical for safety and efficiency."

    "abstract": "In industrial systems, real-time condition monitoring and the detection of processing faults are essential components of the manufacturing process. Computer vision-based crack detection systems can quickly identify critical damage and issues, thereby preventing the production of defective products. However, the real-time detection of small and unshaped cracks in bad working environments poses difficulties for existing methods and affects the recognition system accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a real-time crack detection framework using YOLOv5n, a lightweight object detection model specifically optimized for manufacturing automation processes. As an example application, we implemented the proposed algorithm to detect crack lines in wafer carrier plates used in semiconductor fabrication. The experimental testing results with a custom dataset of wafer carrier plates have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves a satisfactory balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in edge computing environments for industrial inspection systems."

    "abstract": "Fuzzing is one of the most effective vulnerability detection techniques for modern software. Hybrid fuzzing, as an efficient method in fuzzing, enhances testing efficiency through an additional concolic execution component. Seed scheduling significantly impacts the efficiency of hybrid fuzzing. Existing hybrid fuzzing systems schedule seeds based on fixed heuristics designed to predict input utility. However, such heuristic methods often prove inefficient, and these approaches typically exhibit poor transferability - they may perform well on programs from which they were derived but fail to generalize to others. Moreover, due to the efficiency imbalance between the concolic execution component and seed generation component, the concolic execution component can only process a small fraction of generated seeds.To address these issues, this paper proposes an optimization method that first collects high-quality seeds based on features like code coverage, constructs a model using the random forest algorithm to characterize these seeds, and employs this model to classify subsequently generated seeds. Evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid fuzzers, achieving higher code coverage than QSYM. Additionally, the learned model exhibits strong reusability and transferability across different programs."

The data used included nine offensive statistical variables: the number of assists, successful dribbles, shots on target, corner kicks, offside, and number of matches. After going through a preprocessing and standardization process, the K-Means algorithm is applied to form three clusters representing different offensive play patterns: the defender or attacking supporter, the offensive midfielder or the supporting attacker, and the most aggressive main attacker. To evaluate the quality of the grouping results, this study also compared K-Means' performance with Hierarchical Clustering using the Davies-Bouldin Index. The results show that K-Means produces a more compact and separate cluster. This research contributes as a data-based offensive style classification map, which can be used by coaches, analysts, and talent scouts to strategize, evaluate performance, and make recruitment decisions more objectively and efficiently."

Increasing variability associated with climate change can increase scarcity and can lead to resource conflict. This paper demonstrates an approach to using Sentinel-2 satellite images to map biomass productivity using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Cloud-filtered images were processed using open-access tools to generate NDVI areas, identifying areas of vegetation as potential grazing zones. This approach could provide information on vegetation coverage that could help inform migration decisions, reduce competition over scarce resources, and support equitable access to food and water. The approach demonstrates how open data and spatial tools can aid climate adaptation and support conflict prevention in resource-constrained context."

Building on this process, we construct two complementary benchmarks. The image-based benchmark evaluates frame-level reasoning with representative frames, while the video-based benchmark extends to temporally localized segments and incorporates an abnormality scoring task. Experiments on UCF-Crime demonstrate improvements at both the frame and video levels, and ablation studies confirm clear advantages of anomaly-focused sampling over uniform and random baselines."

    "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the impact of Blackhole attacks on the performance of the AODV protocol in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET). The AODV protocol, commonly used because it dynamically forms routes, is highly vulnerable to routing attacks such as Blackhole. In my experience, this attack manipulates the route construction procedure by fraudulently claiming ownership of the shortest path, resulting in the redirection of sent data, which is ultimately discarded by the attacker node. Such vulnerabilities can reduce network reliability and result in significant packet loss. For my testing, I utilized MATLAB to monitor network performance and SUMO to predict traffic flow. To defend against these types of attacks, the AODV protocol was upgraded to incorporate a loop detection mechanism. We compared the system’s performance in the normal and attack modes using latency and throughput measurements. This experimental technique substantially degraded network performance due to the Blackhole attack. The findings show a significant performance degradation due to the Blackhole attack, with throughput decreasing by 43.48% and latency increasing by 33.92%. The main contribution of the work is a detection technique that is lightweight and reduces the impact of the assault while leaving the danger unabated. Contrary to popular belief, mathematical modeling confirms the existence of a correlation between route stability, throughput, and delay. These findings might be useful in developing a funding agency that is both strong and current. This organization need to be disbanded if it does not exist."

At Nigeria's Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), over 80 % of campus waste was recyclable, and researchers proposed color-coded bins, optimized collection routes, and partnerships with recyclers to close the loop [2]. In East Africa, studentled initiatives like Kenyatta University's “Kijani Bin” project-which upcycles plastic bottles into waste bins and runs awareness campaigns-demonstrate how handson student engagement drives behaviour change [4]. Together, these examples highlight that co-designed, behaviour-focused, and value-added approaches can transform universities into models of sustainability for their wider communities."

By constructing a multi-source heterogeneous data fusion system based on Lambda architecture, the data of power generation, meteorology, equipment status, power grid dispatching and market quotation are integrated to realize a comprehensive perception of the new energy operating environment. Furthermore, the two-layer graph neural network (GNN) model is used to mine the spatio-temporal correlation characteristics of new energy systems, so as to improve the forecasting accuracy of power generation. Construct a third-order dynamic risk transmission model of “resource-market-policy” to quantify the risk of new energy investment; A virtual power plant simulation environment based on Unity3D, Monte Carlo simulation and deep Q network (DQN) algorithm is developed to shorten the response time of strategy adjustment to minutes. A case study of a wind, light and storage integration project in Ningxia shows that the prediction accuracy of this model is significantly better than that of the traditional method, and the continuous rank probability score (CRPS) is reduced to 0.04 and 0.03 respectively, and the Mean absolute error (MAE) is as low as 1.1MW. In the aspect of strategic response time, in the face of scenarios such as sudden change of electricity price, extreme weather warning and policy risk transmission, the response time is shortened to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1. 2}$</tex> minutes, 0.8 minutes and 2.1 minutes respectively, which is 99 % to 100 % higher than that of traditional methods.

It involves the integration of a number of services in a simulation control platform to accurately model the travel path of field vehicles, mimic faults in the power network, and realize smart dispatch algorithms. This platform can be used by operators for training purposes to improve crew dispatch. The services provided by the simulation control platform consist of real-time FC tracking and automated dispatching, fault localization and restoration, and notifications and visualization. The proposed solution has been tested and validated using a real distribution network comprising three 11kV feeders.

The enhanced version of HoloAir provides an environment where learners can interactively manipulate state quantities such as pressure, volume, and temperature to explore their relationships. We specifically designed and implemented \"educational scaffolding\" that links abstract physical quantities to visual feedback accompanied by physical sensations, such as representing volume changes as the vertical movement of the ceiling within the VR space. The results of a usability evaluation conducted with seven graduate students in information science showed that learning involving physical sensations, such as the ceiling’s movement, significantly promoted a more intuitive understanding of the laws compared to learning with only numerical changes. These results suggest that embodied learning experiences using VR are effective in deepening the understanding of abstract scientific concepts."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the cage fish farming process practiced by farmers at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, Kenya. The research expounds upon issues discussed by cage fish farmers and the potential viability of their proposed solutions. We outline the various stages of the fish farming cycle, including cage construction, the stocking, growing, and harvesting of tilapia, and the fish market, as described by cage fish farmers. We also identify common issues farmers encounter during each stage of the process and the methods farmers use to address them. By defining these process and challenges, we aim to provide insights into the budding Kenyan cage fish farming market and suggest methods for enhancing Kisumu farmers’ efficiency and economic viability. We asked 23 cage fish farmers to split into three groups to outline the cage farming process from start to finish. Each group was then asked to list the problems they faced and discuss practical solutions. Each discussion was led by a facilitator, recorded by a notetaker, and monitored by a secondary note taker. From these conversations, we identified five steps in the cage farming cycle - (1) cage construction, (2) stocking the cage, (3) feeding, (4) harvesting, and (5) inspecting. We found no singular cause of low profits amongst farmers in Kisumu, rather farmers described various issues at each point of the cage farming process which collectively decreased their profits. Farmers expressed a wide ‘success bracket,’ spanning from extremely low profits to high ones and indicating significant variability within the market. Key hindrances mentioned by farmers are: a lack of access to technical farming knowledge, access to quality trainings and the continuity of knowledge sharing between farmers; identifying quality feeds; the capital costs of farming, including cage costs, quality feed costs, and access to payment plans and loans; and security, including lake pollution due to large companies, mass fish kills, and tearing of underwater nets. Farmers proposed several potential solutions, most notably real-time knowledge sharing through water quality sensors and education on how to use that information, and a pay as you go model for purchasing cages to reduce barriers to entry. High earners in the market show that cage fish farming at Dunga Beach has the potential to be an extremely profitable business, however lack of technical knowledge, capital, and security are leading many farmers to suffer low returns. This paper expounds upon the issues discussed by cage fish farmers and the potential viability of their proposed solutions."

Despite its great potential, the smart healthcare implementation process faces various challenges such as user acceptance, organizational readiness, technological infrastructure, and complex regulations. This study aims to identify the main factors that influence the success of Smart Healthcare implementation through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. A total of 135 scientific articles were collected and selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 29 selected studies that were analyzed in depth. As a result, 52 main factors were found and grouped into five components based on a combination framework that takes from the Leavitt Diamond Model and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework. The factors include People, Process, Technology, Organization, and Environment. The result shows that the Technology and People components are the most dominant aspects that influence Smart Hospital implementation, followed by Organization, Process, and Environment."

    "abstract": "Phishing remains a pervasive social engineering threat, undermining users across ubiquitous and interconnected computing environments. Unlike traditional exploits, phishing adapts dynamically, leveraging emotional triggers, urgency, and high-fidelity mimicry to bypass technical defenses. This paper reports on phishing experiments conducted in the wild, designed to capture unprimed user behavior under realistic conditions rather than laboratory constraints. Data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a natural context of heightened uncertainty that parallels attacker exploitation strategies. Three contributions are emphasized. First, we present empirical evidence of susceptibility and lure effectiveness under authentic delivery constraints, documenting how adaptive spam filters shaped exposure over time. Second, we analyze methodological lessons, including the decision to abandon tracking-pixel “opens” in favor of unique-token click-throughs, aligning with recent cautions about automated prefetching and measurement bias. Third, we evaluate the ethical and legal considerations of deception-based fieldwork, situating safeguards within the Menlo framework and recent critiques of IRB sufficiency. The findings highlight that in ubiquitous computing environments, resilience depends not only on end-user awareness but also on system-level factors such as filtering dynamics, crowd-sourced detection, and measurement robustness. Lessons from this case study provide guidance for researchers and practitioners designing context-aware, humancentered defenses in pervasive systems."

This study presents a comprehensive machine learning framework that integrates behavioral intention analytics with advanced feature engineering techniques for enhanced CLV prediction accuracy. Using a dataset of 300 customer records from a digital service provider, we developed and evaluated eight machine learning models spanning both classification and regression paradigms. Our novel feature engineering approach incorporates Satisfaction Gap Score calculations, weighted Loyalty Index construction, and K-means clustering-based customer segmentation. The XGBoost classifier achieved superior performance with 94.2% accuracy and 0.963 AUC-ROC, while the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated optimal regression performance with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.923. Feature importance analysis revealed that engineered behavioral features significantly outperformed traditional demographic variables, with the Loyalty Index and Satisfaction Gap Score emerging as the strongest predictors.

This research proposes an enhanced steganographic scheme combining Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) and XOR-based Very Least Significant Bit (XOR-VLSB) techniques, termed PVD and XOR-VLSB StegoCrypto, to improve the security of encrypted data embedded in true color images. The proposed method leverages the adaptability of PVD for embedding capacity optimization while utilizing XOR-VLSB to enhance security against statistical and steganalysis attacks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves a high embedding capacity while preserving image quality, as evidenced by peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) evaluations. Additionally, security analysis confirms the robustness of the scheme against various steganalytic techniques. These findings demonstrate that the PVD and XOR-VLSB StegoCrypto scheme provides an efficient and secure approach for encrypted data concealment in true color images, making it suitable for various sensitive data protection applications."

    "abstract": "Large-scale datasets, particularly those collected from smart devices and Internet of Things sensors, usually exhibit significant temporal and spatial sparsity, resulting in high amounts of missing data. Unless addressed in the analysis, this sparsity can result in substantial gaps and biases as well as limit the generalizability of conclusions drawn from such data. To address this challenge in data quality, we contribute the Sparsity-Aware Reconstruction Framework (SARF) as a novel and unified data fusion and reconstruction framework that enhances data quality and addresses sparsity. SARF analyzes datasets, partitioning the data into segments with similar characteristics, and reconstructs the data in each segment individually by selecting a reconstruction technique that is tailored to the internal temporal-spatial characteristics of the dataset. Through extensive experiments on two representative datasets - mobile application measurements and IoT sensor data from low-cost air quality sensors - we demonstrate that the targeted adaptation of reconstruction strategies employed by SARF significantly enhances the quality of reconstructed data. Our results show the robustness of SARF's performance across spatiotemporal variations, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods by margins up to 68% on average (74% for compressive sensing, 53% for convolutional sparse coding, 78% for deep learning). These findings underscore SARF's potential to enhance datadriven insights across multiple domains, paving the way for more robust analyses of sparsity-affected datasets."

    "abstract": "Absolute visual localization based on onboard cameras and geo-referenced data is the dominant solution for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not available. However, current image-based matching methods are easily affected by significant feature differences between UAV images and geo-referenced images, and map-based matching methods are affected by image rotation and resolution differences. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a rotation and scale invariance map matching method (RSIM) to realize UAV visual localization in urban scenarios. Specifically, RSIM first extracts building contour information from UAV images. Then, based on the shape and spatial relationship features of the buildings, a scene matching method is designed to match the UAV image and the vector e-map. Finally, the centers of the matched building individuals are used as control points for UAV position solving. Extensive experiments conducted on the LoFTR and DKM datasets demonstrate that the proposed RSIM algorithm achieves superior localization performance compared to existing deep learning-based image matching methods. Moreover, our RSIM effectively enables UAV localization in urban scenarios even when the orientation and resolution of UAV images are unknown, achieving performance comparable to the SSRM map matching method, which relies on prior knowledge of these parameters."

    "abstract": "Feature upsampling is a fundamental and indispensable ingredient of almost all current network structures for dense prediction tasks. Very recently, a popular similarity-based feature upsampling pipeline has been proposed, which utilizes a high-resolution (HR) feature as guidance to help upsample the low-resolution (LR) deep feature based on their local similarity. Albeit achieving promising performance, this pipeline has specific limitations in methodological designs: 1) HR query and LR key features are not well aligned in a controllable manner; 2) the similarity between query–key features is computed based on the fixed inner product form, lacking flexibility; and 3) neighbor selection is coarsely operated on LR features, resulting in mosaic artifacts. These shortcomings make the existing methods along this pipeline primarily applicable to hierarchical network architectures with iterative features as guidance, and they are not readily extended to a broader range of structures, especially for a direct high-ratio upsampling. Against these issues, we thoroughly refresh this pipeline and meticulously optimize every methodological design. Specifically, we first propose an explicitly controllable query–key feature alignment from both semantic-aware and detail-aware perspectives and then construct a parameterized paired central difference convolution block for flexibly calculating the similarity between the well-aligned query–key features. Besides, we develop a fine-grained neighbor selection strategy on HR features, which is simple yet effective for alleviating mosaic artifacts. Based on these careful designs, we systematically construct a refreshed similarity-based feature upsampling framework named ReSFU. Based on 13 types of network backbones, comprehensive experiments substantiate that only in a simple and direct high-ratio upsampling manner, our ReSFU consistently achieves satisfactory performance on six tasks, including semantic segmentation, medical image segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation, showing superior generality and ease of deployment beyond the existing upsamplers.

    "abstract": "Power inspection via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is critical for grid reliability but is hindered by complex challenges: multi-scale targets, frequent occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. While deep learning offers solutions, existing models struggle to balance global context and local detail efficiently. This paper introduces MAAN (Mamba and Area Attention Network), a novel power target detection network that integrates a visual state space model (VSS) with a regional attention mechanism through a dual-branch architecture. The core module of MAAN, referred to as MAA, effectively integrates the visual state space model (VSS) with a regional attention mechanism. Through a dual-branch architecture, the module separately captures global long-range dependencies and local detailed features. Furthermore, it incorporates cross-attention and adaptive weighting mechanisms to enable dynamic feature interaction and fusion, thereby significantly enhancing the model’s capacity to represent complex power targets, specifically tailored for challenging UAV-based power inspection scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on two public power datasets—PTL-AI_Furnas and CSAT CT Dataset V1—as well as the general-purpose PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that MAAN outperforms the YOLOv12 model in terms of precision (P), recall (R), and mean average precision (mAP). Specifically, in terms of mAP50, achieving significant improvements in mAP50 of 2.4%, 2.5%, and 3.2% over the YOLOv12 baseline on the PTL-AI_Furnas, CSAT CT Dataset V1, and PASCAL VOC 2012, respectively, with particularly notable gains in the detection performance for multiscale and occluded targets. Moreover, we conducted comparative evaluations with the latest YOLOv13 network on the PTL-AI_Furnas dataset. The results indicate that under identical experimental conditions, MAAN surpasses YOLOv13 by 5.2% in mAP50, further confirming the superiority of the proposed method. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the newly designed module. This research presents a promising new technical approach for object detection in complex power environments."

    "abstract": "Accurate short-term wind speed forecasting is essential for reliable and efficient wind energy integration. This paper introduces an enhanced Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network optimized through a Bayesian-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework. The proposed RVFL-OptBayes model incorporates multi-scale feature generation, including kernel approximations, Nyström sampling, Fastfood transforms, wavelet scattering, and Neural Tangent Kernel embeddings with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-aligned orthogonal initializations and spectral normalization to improve stability and feature diversity. Experiments were conducted on real-world Brazilian wind farm data to evaluate forecasting performance. Results show that RVFL-OptBayes outperforms conventional RVFL networks, deep learning models, and ensemble methods, achieving an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> above 0.99. The proposed framework demonstrates that lightweight randomized architectures, when combined with principled hyperparameter search, can rival or surpass complex deep learning models for time-series forecasting. The findings suggest strong potential for practical deployment in renewable energy systems, offering accurate and computationally efficient wind speed predictions to support operational planning, grid stability, and smart energy management."

    "abstract": "Safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) in dynamic multi-agent environments, such as university campuses and industrial parks, necessitates accurate trajectory prediction of interacting agents. Conventional autonomous navigation systems, however, rely heavily on reactive real-time perception and often fail to predict complex spatio-temporal interactions among heterogeneous agents. This limitation frequently leads to suboptimal motion planning outcomes and operational inefficiencies, including deadlock situations, in congested scenarios. This paper introduces Knowledge-Interaction-Temporal Network (KITNet), a novel trajectory prediction framework specifically designed for ADVs operating in such complex, dynamic settings. KITNet employs a hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to model intricate interaction dynamics, incorporating a novel attention mechanism based on set theory for enhanced spatio-temporal feature extraction and prediction of diverse behavior patterns. We evaluate KITNet on several trajectory prediction benchmarks according to the different tailored behavior modes under the defined mode space, including the ETH/UCY pedestrian dataset, the NGSIM highway driving dataset, and the Argoverse 2 urban driving dataset. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, outperforming or matching existing graph-based and recurrent approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of KITNet’s predictive outputs into local motion planning modules, showing potential for significantly reducing conflict scenarios and optimizing trajectory execution for ADVs. These findings establish KITNet as a highly effective trajectory predictor for autonomous transport systems, critically advancing predictive navigation and bridging the gap between perception and robust intelligent decision-making in complex urban and campus environments."

    "abstract": "The modulation transfer function tailored image filter (MTF-TIF) has long been regarded as the optimal filter for multispectral image pansharpening. It excels at simulating the camera’s frequency response, thereby capturing finer image details and significantly improving pansharpening performance. However, we are skeptical that the pre-measured MTF is sufficient to describe the characteristics of actually acquired panchromatic image (PAN) and multispectral image (MSI). For example, any image resampling operation in geometric correction or image registration inevitably changes the sharpness of acquired PAN and MSI, and the processed images no longer conform to the camera’s MTF. Further, following the Wald protocol, in deep learning (DL) methods using MTF-TIF for downsampling images to construct training data does not satisfy the generalization consistency of training and testing. To prove our point, we propose a pair of symmetric frameworks based on DL in this paper, to find better image filters suitable for both traditional and DL pansharpening methods. We embed two learnable filters into the frameworks to simulate the optimal image filter, namely anisotropic Gaussian image filter and arbitrary image filter. Further, the proposed frameworks can capture subtle offsets between images and maintain the smoothness of the global deformation field. Extensive experiments on various satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks can find better image filters than MTF-TIFs, which can achieve better pansharpening performance with stronger generalization ability."

    "abstract": "Automotive datasets are typically captured using a small number of cameras, with each camera fixed at a single focus setting. In practice, however, camera modules exhibit unit-to-unit variability in their effective focus due to manufacturing tolerances. Since perception models are usually trained on images captured at one nominal focus position, real-world deviations in focus can introduce a domain mismatch that degrades perception performance. We demonstrate this effect by simulating two different optical systems on synthetic and real images with fields of view of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$150^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>. For all simulations, we utilise the Python-based ray-tracing library KrakenOS, an open-source optical simulation tool. By assigning each optical system to a suitable dataset, we degrade the held-out test data of four public automotive datasets: KITTI, Virtual KITTI 2.0, Woodscape, and Parallel Domain Woodscape. We evaluate the impact of applying optical defocus on 2D Object Detection models with the popular OpenMMLab toolkit for MMDetection and the YOLOv11 architecture. For each optical system, we simulate 9 defocus settings on the test data, representative of the production tolerance range for camera defocus. The results show that object detection performance degrades as the magnitude of defocus increases. Align DETR, despite having the second fewest parameters, establishes the strongest baseline and remains robust under modest defocus (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$|\\Delta z|\\le 20,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) across all datasets.

    "abstract": "Despite demonstrating superior Rate-Distortion (RD) performance, Learning-based Image Compression (LIC) algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to malicious perturbations in recent studies. However, the adversarial attacks considered in existing literature remain divergent from real-world scenarios, both in terms of the attack direction and bitrate. Additionally, existing methods focus solely on empirical observations of the model vulnerability, neglecting to identify the origin of it. These limitations hinder the comprehensive investigation and in-depth understanding of the adversarial robustness of LIC algorithms. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper considers the arbitrary nature of the attack direction and the uncontrollable compression ratio faced by adversaries, and presents two practical rate-distortion attack paradigms, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, Specific-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (SRDA) and Agnostic-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (ARDA). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct joint rate-distortion attacks on LIC algorithms. Using the performance variations as indicators, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of eight predominant LIC algorithms against diverse attacks. Furthermore, we propose two novel analytical tools for in-depth analysis, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, Entropy Causal Intervention and Layer-wise Distance Magnify Ratio, and reveal that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hyperprior</i> significantly increases the bitrate and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Inverse Generalized Divisive Normalization (IGDN)</i> significantly amplifies input perturbations when under attack. Lastly, we examine the efficacy of adversarial training and introduce the use of online updating for defense. By comparing their advantages and disadvantages, we provide a reference for constructing more robust LIC algorithms against the rate-distortion attacks."

A multibeam OAM system in this paper that is specifically designed to estimate the micro-motion parameters of rotating targets, such as the rotation center's position, the rotation attitude, and the rotation radius. In details, we first estimate the rotational angular velocity of different scattering points based on STFT spectra, and then estimate the rotational Doppler frequency parameters of the scattering points separately under each beam. After achieving target correlation based on geometric relationships, micro-motion parameter estimation of the target was achieved in the OAM multibeam system. Finally, we derive the Cramér- Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the estimation of the micromotion parameters. Both mathematical analyses and simulation results show that the proposed parameters estimation method can accurately estimate the micro-motion parameters of the rotating target with the proposed OAM multibeam system."

    "abstract": "Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However, due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality. Specifically, inspired by human driver visual system, we design a bio-inspired 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point cloud upsampling tasks."

The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0. This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles. Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry."

    "abstract": "How can we empower consumers to make healthier dietary choices and alleviate the global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through simple, scalable interventions? Nutritional labelling-particularly front-of-package labelling (FOPL)-has emerged as a promising public health strategy to guide consumer behavior and improve food environments. While robust evidence from high-income countries shows that FOPLs can effectively promote healthier purchasing patterns, their implementation and context-specific adaptation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not been adequately explored. This article presents a comprehensive review of global FOPL systems, categorizing them into directive, semi-directive, and non-directive formats, and evaluating their effectiveness in shaping consumer choices. Specific attention is given to the feasibility and potential of semi-directive systems in LMICs, where a balance between informational clarity and implementation practicality is crucial. However, the success of FOPL interventions is contingent not only on the label design itself but also on broader enabling factors-such as public education, regulatory frameworks, and trust in oversight mechanisms. Ultimately, this review positions front-of-package labelling as a scalable and adaptable tool that promotes healthier food consumption and reduces the burden of diet related NCDs in vulnerable populations in LMICs."

Using a structured review guided by the PRISMA methodology, the analysis focuses on privacy concerns, data capture methods, data storage and sharing practices, and proposed technical mitigations. To structure and synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their personal data more. Strategies to improve regulatory and technical safeguards are also provided. The review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions. The limitations of this literature review are also explained. The findings have significant implications for policy development and the transparency of data collection for smart devices."

    "abstract": "One of the major technological advancements in the modern era is machine automation, which could help companies by simplifying tasks that are commonly performed by human resources. However, automation has a negative impact by causing job losses. On the other hand, machine automation can provide benefits to employees, such as helping to increase productivity and effectiveness at work. The objective of this study is to explore the influence of machine automation on employee performance optimism, as well as the role of job insecurity and work engagement as mediating variables, and conscientiousness as a moderating variable. Using a quantitative survey method with 102 employees in the manufacturing sector, the structural model analysis results showed that the use of machine automation has a significant impact on job insecurity but does not directly affect work engagement and performance optimism. Additionally, conscientiousness was not proven to be a moderator that could strengthen the relationship between machine automation and other variables. Nevertheless, work engagement has a significant positive relationship with performance optimism, indicating that employees who are more engaged in their work tend to be more optimistic about their performance. This study emphasizes that although automation can increase job insecurity, it does not necessarily reduce employee engagement or optimism about their performance, so companies that implement automation should focus on enhancing work engagement as a key factor in maintaining employee optimism."

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have been shown to exhibit systemic inflammation. Effective management of lower limb venous return is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of passive resistance exercise on inflammatory markers and physical performance in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD). An intelligent external pulsed compression (SEPC) device was applied to the calves. This device integrates advanced wearable biosensors, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), passive resistance muscle exercise, and peripheral venous return enhancement technology. Within six months, the incidence of IDH decreased from 34.43% to 7.55%, and the proportion of IDH patients also decreased, indicating that SEPC can significantly reduce the incidence rate (from 32.98% to 6.19%). Inflammatory markers were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). The markers evaluated included C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and classical monocytes. The study found that six months of SEPC exercise during regular dialysis led to improvements in patients' physical function. This finding suggests that SEPC effectively reduces the incidence of HD-related complications and significantly improves clinical outcomes and quality of life in the entire patient population. The administration of SEPC during conventional dialysis has been demonstrated to elicit anti-inflammatory effects. SEPC has been shown to enhance physical function and functional capacity in cases of chronic inflammation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents self-powered wearable wireless communication system based on hybrid energy harvesting. The proposed system integrates a communication antenna, RF rectenna and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) into a compact, structure through a shared-aperture approach. It supports wireless data transmission simultaneously harvesting ambient RF and mechanical energy to enable battery-independent operation. The communication and rectifying antennas operate in the 2.4–2.5 GHz band, achieving peak gains of 5.3 dBi and 6 dBi, respectively, with a maximum radiation efficiency of 60%. Orthogonal polarization ensures effective antenna isolation. The RF rectifier achieves a power conversion efficiency of up to 70%, and the dual antennas also serve as electrodes for the TENG. Dedicated power management circuits are employed to handle the distinct characteristics of the two energy sources, ensuring efficient energy regulation and storage. This work provides a viable pathway for the development of next-generation battery-free, self-sustaining wearable IoT systems."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for energy-efficient on-device AI in consumer appliances is drawing significant attention to Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures. This trend is largely driven by the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs). While these models have enabled remarkable advances in reasoning and generative tasks, they increasingly face the memory wall problem, where data movement between processors and memory dominates both latency and energy consumption. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution by executing memory-intensive workloads directly within memory, thereby reducing data transfer overhead. However, efficient integration of PIM into existing heterogeneous systems requires careful management of data transfers between host processors and PIM devices, as well as scheduling policies for inference graph execution. This paper introduces a Node-Aware tensor offloading method that leverages topological analysis of the model computational graph to capture tensor layout relationships across consumer nodes. An Affinity-Based device scheduling algorithm is also proposed, which uses a shared hash table to align operand tensors with their execution device for each operation kernel, eliminating redundant inter-device communication. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method extends a GDDR6-based PIM emulation framework integrated with ONNX Runtime to support 4D matrix multiplication. The optimizations achieve up to 15.63× and 29.3× latency reduction for QK and SV multiplications in the prefill stage, resulting in 93.6% and 94.0% energy savings, respectively. Additionally, in the decoding stage, execution time is reduced by 1.09× and 2.01×, resulting in 8.3% and 50.4% energy savings, respectively."

In this paper, an enhancement algorithm and adaptive generation method of practical writing for cross-domain scenes are proposed, aiming to help writers cross domain barriers and achieve efficient and accurate writing. The overall framework of the algorithm covers four modules: data preprocessing, domain adaptation, text generation and post-processing. Among them, the domain adaptive module uses deep learning technology, pre-trained BERT model and CNN to extract domain features, and realizes knowledge transfer through domain adaptive technology and antagonistic training; Text generation module combines template and generation strategy, and introduces GPT language model to optimize text. The experiment takes legal documents and business mail data sets as examples, and the results show that the algorithm can effectively generate practical texts that meet the specifications and styles of the target domain."

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency has emerged as a leading digital innovation in the financial and technological landscape, playing an increasingly significant role in the global financial ecosystem. However, their prices are highly volatile and are influenced by a wide range of external factors, making accurate forecasting complex and essential. This study intends to compare two popular machine learning algorithms equipped in time-series forecasting, namely LSTM and XGBoost which are optimized using Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. Their predictive performance is compared using daily historical data of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana from its first appearance to 28 May 2025, and trained using two data normalization techniques: StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, combined with two different sliding window configurations: 7-day and 30-day window, each with a 1-day forecasting horizon. Evaluation of each model's performance will be determined using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. This research’s findings show that GS-LSTM using a 7-day sliding window and MinMaxScaler with 80/20 data split achieved the best overall results. However, results varied across cryptocurrencies: GS-LSTM with 7-day window and MinMaxScaler with an 80/20 data split performed best for Bitcoin and Ripple; StandardScaler worked better for Ethereum; and a 30-day window with StandardScaler and an 80/10/10 data split was optimal for Solana. This research has assessed the influence of data normalization techniques, sliding window approaches, and hyperparameter tuning algorithms on the predictive performance of LSTM and XGBoost in cryptocurrency price forecasting."

    "abstract": "Polymorphic encryption techniques are relatively new and generally not well understood. Although practitioners claim that this type of encryption is slower due to steps such as sharding, selecting random keys, and choosing random ciphers, these encryptions can be even faster than the linear version of encryption for the same message. However, there has been no published mathematical analysis of this claim. (Security analysis is beyond the scope of this paper.) The study presented in this paper encompasses shards of both identical and differing sizes. It also demonstrates that partitioning and queuing functions can be handled by one or more cores, enabling efficient and predictable operation and analysis. Logic might dictate that speeding up processing would require the use of multiple cores, threads, or GPUs, since shards constitute orthogonal encryption problems. However, with only two cores, a polymorphic cipher offers superior security without loss of speed. Ambiguous statistical analysis techniques, such as benchmarking, are not used due to the impossibility of effectively controlling for all hardware variations and configurations, and because even on the same hardware, non-real-time OS schedulers can cause significant variation from one test to the next. Rigorous mathematical analysis is used here, because it is much more reliable for comparative study."

The technology outputs quantitative E. coli levels, is designed for continuous in-situ deployment, and utilizes internet connectivity to upload data in real time. Ongoing sensor deployments to validate the sensor performance are being conducted with partners across diverse environmental and social contexts. In Kenya, the sensor monitors borehole system functionality for community drinking water systems, where detection of contaminated water can inform health advisories and infrastructure repair. In Kigali, Rwanda sensors are installed in community water filters to validate filter functionality and support carbon credit generation.

Firstly, the mmWave channel model including multipath effect and path loss is established, and the channel state information (CSI) is reconstructed from a small number of observation data by compressed sensing technology, and the initial channel estimation is made by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Then, the depth residual network is introduced to optimize the initial estimation results of OMP, and the nonlinear mapping ability of DNN is used to further improve the estimation accuracy. In addition, this paper transforms DNN optimization problem into GA fitness function optimization problem, and improves the generalization ability of DNN parameters through population evolution. The simulation results show that the OMP+DNN+GA method proposed in this paper improves the channel estimation accuracy by about 3.5 dB compared with the traditional OMP algorithm in the indoor mmWave communication scenario with 28 GHz band and 400 MHz bandwidth, and the normalized mean square error (NMSE) reaches -25.6 dB when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 20 dB, which meets the requirements of 6 G system. At the same time, this method has excellent performance in bit error rate (BER). When SNR is 20 dB, BER is as low as 3.0e-7, which is significantly lower than the traditional method. The introduction of GA further improves the convergence speed and performance stability of the system, and verifies the effectiveness of the intelligent optimization algorithm in channel estimation of 6G mmWave."

This project collects various resources about Climate Obstruction into a knowledge graph corpus using a Large Language Model (LLM) as the user interface via a Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture (RAG). The corpus includes databases about Climate Obstruction as well as documents that define concepts such as Green Washing. The immediate benefit is a tool that facilitates accessing heterogeneous data in a unified portal via natural language. Our approach uses the logical foundation of the Web Ontology Language (OWL), coupled with the LLM capability to model text meaning as vectors.

However, deploying advanced models such as YOLOv8 on edge devices poses challenges due to limited computational and memory resources. This study evaluates the effectiveness of compressing YOLOv8n using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) to enable real-time egg detection in resource-constrained environments. A custom dataset of annotated egg images was used to train a baseline YOLOv8n model. The trained model was then converted into two TFLite variants: 16-bit floating point (FP16) and 8-bit integer (INT8), using TensorFlow’s export pipeline. The original YOLOv8n achieved 0.87 mAP@0.5, 0.88 precision, and 0.86 recall with a memory size of 5.96 MB. The FP16 model preserved comparable accuracy (mAP@0.5 = 0.83) while reducing memory usage to 5.88 MB and improving inference time. The INT8 model further reduced memory usage to 3.13 MB, with minor accuracy degradation (mAP@0.5 = 0.80, precision = 0.85, recall = 0.84). The results demonstrate that TFLite-based compression enhances model deployability on edge hardware by reducing resource demands while maintaining real-time performance, providing practical insights for implementing efficient object detection in smart farming applications."

    "abstract": "This project explores the feasibility of integrating Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to support conversations in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our goal was to develop the framework and prototype of a system capable of generating meaningful narratives from both images and videos. However, due to technical and resource constraints, we refined the scope to focus solely on image-based inputs. We implement vision-language models to generate simplified, contextually relevant captions that can be adapted to the user's communication level through a most-to-least prompting strategy. The end product is a web-based prototype using Streamlit. The prototype features an accessible interface designed for users with ASD, text-to-speech functionality, and adjustable prompt fading controls. This system establishes a foundation for future research aimed at improving the quality of narrative generation, incorporating user feedback, and implementing a scalable platform that supports expressive communication and social participation for individuals with ASD."

    "abstract": "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) utilizes power readings from electrical appliances to gain insights about energy usage without the use of specialize sensors. Many applications of NILM focus on the classification of electrical appliances. This study investigates cases of anomalous utilization of household appliances based on an unusually long duration. Automatic detection of anomalous usage would facilitate a system of reminders to shut off electrical appliances and to reduce unnecessary power utilization. This study develops machine learning approaches to classifying cases of anomalous durations of electrical utilization. The publicly available SustDataE2 data set provides a time series of electrical power readings for a range of household appliances. We defined anomalous cases based upon a duration that exceeds 1.5 standard deviations above the average value partitioned by category. We developed random forest machine learning models to classify anomalous cases. The features of the model include the observed peak power, mean power, time to peak power, and the number of local maxima prior to the peak for each period of activation. We also incorporate a predicted classification of the appliance category based on an intermediate random forest model. In addition to the original training data, we also applied upsampling to increase the number of cases in the training data by a factor of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4}$</tex>. The classification models of anomalous duration were compared based upon a range of classification metrics. These models demonstrated moderate performance, modest specificity. The balanced accuracy of the upsampled model was <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 4. 0 \\%}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "With the wide access of renewable energy sources and the continuous improvement of power system intelligence, Virtual Power Plant (VPP), as an important means of integrating distributed energy resources, has gradually become a key component in the construction of smart grid. Due to the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the volatility of customer load, VPP faces the problems of insufficient prediction accuracy and inefficient scheduling efficiency in actual operation. The development of big data technology provides new ideas for the accurate prediction and intelligent dispatch of virtual power plants. This paper focuses on the research of virtual power plant prediction and scheduling algorithms based on big data, firstly, we analyze the acquisition and processing of heterogeneous data from multiple sources in the virtual power plant, and construct a load prediction framework integrating machine learning and deep learning models; then, we put forward a multi-objective scheduling optimization algorithm, which improves the economy and reliability of the scheduling strategy; and finally, we discuss the collaborative control mechanism based on the big data drive to realize the dynamic resources within the virtual power plant and to realize the dynamic resources within the virtual power plant. Finally, a big data-driven cooperative control mechanism is explored to realize dynamic coordination and adaptive scheduling of resources within virtual power plants. The results of the study show that big data technology has significant advantages in improving the operational efficiency and intelligence level of virtual power plants, which provides theoretical support and technical paths for the construction of a new type of power system."

    "abstract": "In game studies, narrative and mechanics have long been treated as distinct entry points of analysis. Research on game addiction has largely focused on Flow Theory and Positive Feedback Loops, emphasizing how mechanics sustain immersion and reinforce addictive behaviors. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to how narratives shape addiction, either intensifying or mitigating it. Metafiction games, as a self-reflective genre, often disrupt immersion through strategies such as breaking the fourth wall, prompting players to reflect on their actions, and interrupting the flow of play. Drawing on Brecht's theory of the alienation effect, this paper examines how metafiction games can reduce addictive tendencies through narrative, and explores ways of embedding anti-addiction strategies into game design. As a theoretical inquiry, the study offers a framework for future empirical validation and provides a reference point for developing narrative-based approaches to addiction prevention in games."

    "abstract": "Traditional modeling methods rely on simplified models and limited data, so it is difficult to accurately reflect the complexity and dynamics of the system. This paper proposes a comprehensive modeling method based on multisource data, which integrates multi-source data such as sensors, monitoring equipment and historical records, and establishes a comprehensive model of environmental energy system (EES) through data preprocessing, feature extraction and model construction. In data fusion, Kalman filter algorithm is used to fuse sensor data to improve the accuracy of system state estimation; In feature selection, ReliefF algorithm is used to screen out features useful for modeling; Deep neural network (DNN) is selected for modeling, and the prediction of EES performance index is realized through the division of training set, verification set and test set and the training of back propagation algorithm. In the research of optimization algorithm, this paper chooses Differential Evolution Algorithm (DE) as the main optimization algorithm to reduce the total energy consumption of the system, improve the energy efficiency by at least 10 % and reduce carbon emissions. DE algorithm iteratively optimizes through the steps of population initialization, mutation operation, crossover operation and selection operation until it meets the predetermined iteration times or convergence conditions. Taking an industrial production line as an example, through the data fusion of Kalman filter algorithm and the establishment of DNN model, the optimization measures have significantly improved a number of key performance indicators. The energy utilization efficiency has increased by 12 %, the total energy consumption of the system has decreased by 10 %, the carbon emission has decreased by 16 %, and the production qualification rate and the average running time of equipment have also been optimized, which proves the effectiveness and practicability of the multi-source data-driven comprehensive modeling method and optimization algorithm in EES optimization, and provides useful reference for other EES optimization."

    "abstract": "As an important part of power system, the stability and reliability of distribution network's operation state are directly related to users' electricity consumption experience and the normal operation of economy and society. However, the complex distribution network structure and frequent line faults, especially single-phase grounding faults, have brought great challenges to the operation and maintenance of the power grid. Traditional troubleshooting methods rely on manual inspection and empirical judgment, which are inefficient and have limited accuracy. In this paper, a distribution network condition monitoring and fault diagnosis algorithm based on Beidou positioning system is proposed. The system consists of digital fault indicator of distribution network, Beidou communication network and master station system. Through real-time monitoring of current, voltage and other parameters of distribution network, Beidou positioning module is used to determine the fault location, and fault diagnosis is carried out with the help of intelligent algorithm. The algorithm extracts fault features through wavelet transform, makes preliminary fault location and type judgment by combining Beidou positioning information, further establishes fault model and introduces genetic algorithm optimization to improve diagnosis accuracy and speed. The experimental results show that the algorithm is superior to the existing technology in fault location accuracy, fault type judgment accuracy and operation efficiency, and can realize high-precision diagnosis in a variety of complex fault scenarios, providing new technical support and solutions for intelligent operation and maintenance of distribution networks."

    "abstract": "With the increasing scale and complexity of modern power grids, the rapid localization and efficient repair of power line faults have become a key issue in ensuring the stable operation of power systems. Traditional fault detection and repair methods often rely on manual inspection or rule-based diagnostic models, which have limitations such as long response time, insufficient accuracy, and poor adaptability. In recent years, the application of intelligent algorithms in power systems has become increasingly widespread, and fault diagnosis and repair schemes based on machine learning, deep learning and intelligent optimization techniques can effectively improve the accuracy of fault location and repair efficiency. This paper systematically discusses the application of intelligent algorithms in fault location and repair of power lines, analyzes the data-driven fault detection method, and focuses on the improvement of intelligent optimization algorithms in positioning accuracy. Intelligent repair strategies based on automated scheduling, robot and UAV-assisted repair, and multi-source information fusion are studied. Future development directions are proposed to address the challenges faced by the current technology, such as algorithm generalization capability, computational resource requirements and real-time issues. The study shows that the intelligent algorithm-driven fault location and repair technology can significantly improve the intelligent management level of power grids, which is of great significance for enhancing the security and reliability of power systems."

The analysis integrates MODIS MCDl2Qlland-cover data (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) scheme, 500 m resolution) with Landsat 7/8 surface reflectance composites (30 m resolution) to quantify changes in land classes and vegetation health. The workflow involves (1) computing pixel counts for 17 IGBP categories in 2001 and 2020, (2) generating median Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites with corresponding sum-mary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum), and (3) sampling 1,000 random pixels in 2020 to examine the NDVI-IGBP class relationship. To strengthen the validity of findings, the results were cross-validated using official zoning maps and visual inspection against high-resolution basemaps. A preliminary supervised learning experiment using logistic regression was also conducted to demonstrate the dataset's suitability for classification tasks. Results show a 13.9 % decrease in cropland (Class 12) and a 17.0% increase in urbanlbuilt-up land (Class 13), along with a decline in mean NDVI by 0.0315. These findings support applications in environmental monitoring, poli-cymaking, and machine learning workflows.

    "abstract": "The field of recommendation systems has seen rapid innovation and exploration of new techniques in recent years. One area of recent focus has been on incorporating large language models (LLMs) into the recommendation process for various purposes. One of the few methods for this incorporation has been to use LLMs to embed textual descriptions of recommendation items into high dimensional vectors. This paper focuses on investigating and comparing the ways these LLM embeddings can be utilized in conjunction with traditional recommendation system methods. In this paper, we design and implement a hybrid recommender system that consists of a collaborative filtering system and multiple separate content-based systems which utilize LLM-generated text embeddings. Several different methods for recommendation based on these embeddings were implemented in order to compare between them. Experimental results indicate a better performance and relevance from methods which rely on item-embedding distances in embedding space than other popular methods, and that clustering embeddings for recommendations may not be possible in all use cases. Additionally, the results highlight the potential utility and use cases of textual embeddings for recommendation systems."

However, reliance on English-only prompts limits applicability in low-resource settings. We present IndoGroundingDINO, the first fully monolingual Indonesian open-vocabulary object detector, by replacing Grounding DINO’s English BERT encoder with IndoBERT and translating caption of the COCO val2017 captions into Indonesian language. We conduct a controlled three-way comparision: (i) English Grounding DINO (Swin-T & BERT) with original English captions, (ii) the same model with manually translated Indonesian captions, and (iii) IndoGroundingDINO (Swin-T & IndoBERT) trained on Indonesian inputs. Each setup uses subsets of 200 COCO images (600 captions) for 20 epochs and evaluated using mAP, Recall, IoU, and F1-score. IndoGroundingDINO achieves an F1-score of 0.210 (versus the English baseline’s 0.220), recovering 91.8% of the F1-score gap, and increases mAP@0.5:0.9 from 0.118 to 0.132 (a 1.1× improvement over the English model, while requiring only 200 images and minimal computational cost. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate high-confidence localization of Indonesian prompts, comparable to the English model. The results show that language-consistent encoders can effectively bridge the performance gaps in monolingual grounding, paving the way for globally inclusive VLMs in under-resourced languages."

By integrating a Pi Pico, BNO055 IMU and SD card into the rocket, we are able to launch the rocket with active vertical-flight steering fin control and got flight data recorded from numerous launches. Although no GPS used, we are able to analyze the active flight control behavior based on fundamental physics and IMU data logging to the SD card. There are plenty of similar hobby projects broadcast over social media platforms; however, few of them have been written down and published to share with the academic community. It is thus the contribution of this paper that we describe in details the design, building and data loggging/analysis of a servo-based model rocket with active control.

In this study, as part of Niihama City's Smart City Project, we aim to solve these issues using IoT technology. We developed a multi-mode wireless communication system to effectively utilize existing wireless systems in daily use. Bluetooth beacons are installed on the taiko floats to obtain real-time location information for each float. The Bluetooth beacons communicate with beacon base stations via Bluetooth. Communication between beacon base stations is via LoRa. Data is collected by the main base station via LoRa, uploaded to the cloud, and displayed on the web application \"Dondoko,\" which presents the taiko float's location information to visitors. This paper introduces this multi-mode wireless communication system. This paper provides a detailed explanation of the system architecture and application functionality.

They play a key role in the global energy transition process with their clean and renewable advantages. However, the output power of wind and PV generation exhibits significant volatility and instability. This characteristic makes it difficult to accurately control and schedule in practical operation, posing many challenges to the grid connected operation of the power grid. Based on this, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL) based joint prediction model for wind and solar power (WSP) generation and electricity load. This model improves the prediction accuracy of WSP generation and load by deeply exploring and learning the dynamic coupling relationship between them. After extensive experimental verification, the model constructed in this article can accurately predict the power and load of WSP generation, providing strong data support for the stable operation and reasonable scheduling of the power grid, and helping to improve the safety and economy of the electrical power system (EPS)."

The dataset included key parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and carbon monoxide (CO). Preprocessing techniques like data augmentation and normalization were applied to enhance model performance. The results revealed that XGBoost outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 77.93%, followed closely by LSTM at 76.77%, and SVM at 76.43%. XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in handling structured data and real-time monitoring, while LSTM excelled at capturing temporal patterns. SVM, though effective for simpler classification tasks, struggled with larger time-series datasets. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning models for improving irrigation water quality predictions.

To address these issues, we propose a two-stage lightweight training framework that integrates model pruning and knowledge distillation. In the first stage, we perform efficient channel reduction using progressive local filter pruning, which balances structural preservation with computational cost reduction. In the second stage, we introduce mask-based adaptive response distillation to overcome the limitations of conventional L1-based response distillation, enabling more effective knowledge transfer focused on informative regions. Experimental results on various benchmark SR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to existing lightweight SR approaches."

    "abstract": "A small number of photovoltaic modules degrade far more rapidly than average, creating a “long tail” in degradation rate distribution that poses a critical challenge to the reliability and financial viability of solar projects. This study investigates the factors contributing to this phenomenon by analyzing a large global dataset from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Our analysis reveals that the long tail is an intrinsic and composite feature of module degradation, not merely a statistical consequence of combining different climates. We identify at least three distinct pathways that could contribute to its formation. The first is accelerated degradation driven by strong statistical associations between different degradation modes, where the interplay of mechanisms appears to be a primary contributor of the most severely degraded modules. The second is rapid early-life failure (infant mortality), which populates the tail with modules likely containing initial manufacturing or material defects. The third is failure of individual latent defects, such as solder fatigue or cell cracks, which can cause sudden severe performance loss at random points in a module's life. Based on our results, we suggest that efforts should be made to understand and mitigate the interaction between associated degradation modes. For instance, the careful selection of key components, such as backsheet, is crucial as it could initiate multiple pathways of degradation."

    "abstract": "Zero-error coding encompasses a variety of source and channel problems where the probability of error must be exactly zero. This condition is stricter than that of the vanishing error regime, where the error probability goes to zero as the code blocklength goes to infinity. In general, zero-error coding is an open combinatorial question. We investigate two unsolved zero-error problems: the source coding problem with side information and the channel coding problem. We focus our attention on families of independent problems for which the probability distribution decomposes into a product of probability distributions. A crucial step is the additivity property of the optimal rate, which does not always hold in the zero-error regime, unlike in the vanishing error regime. When the additivity holds, the concatenation of optimal codes is optimal. We derive a condition under which the additivity of the complementary graph entropy <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i> for the AND product of graphs and for the disjoint union of graphs are equivalent.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), the impact of its stochastic optimization process on the results remains underexplored. We observed that it often produces unstable results where the projections of data points are determined mostly by chance rather than reflecting neighboring structures. To address this limitation, we introduce (r,d)-stability to UMAP: a framework that analyzes the stochastic positioning of data points in the projection space. To assess how stochastic elements-specifically, initial projection positions and negative sampling-impact UMAP results, we introduce “ghosts”, or duplicates of data points representing potential positional variations due to stochasticity. We define a data point's projection as (r,d)-stable if its ghosts perturbed within a circle of radius r in the initial projection remain confined within a circle of radius d for their final positions. To efficiently compute the ghost projections, we develop an adaptive dropping scheme that reduces a runtime up to 60% compared to an unoptimized baseline while maintaining approximately 90% of unstable points. We also present a visualization tool that supports the interactive exploration of the (r,d)-stability of data points. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by examining the stability of projections of real-world datasets and present usage guidelines for the effective use of our framework."

While edge computing offers a viable paradigm for decentralized DL by preserving data privacy and reducing latency, the substantial energy costs of DL training and inference pose a major challenge for resource-constrained edge devices. This work provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art studies that address energy efficiency at the intersection of DL and edge computing. Moving beyond isolated solutions, we analyze the critical need for a co-design approach integrating hardware and software with adaptive resource management to build sustainable systems. The paper systematically examines hardware-level optimizations and software-level techniques for reducing energy consumption while maintaining model accuracy. Furthermore, it investigates how adaptive management of compute, memory, and communication resources is key to dynamic energy savings. Finally, the paper synthesizes recent trends, identifies emerging opportunities, and discusses open challenges, positioning hardware-software co-design as the most promising approach for achieving scalable and energy-efficient deep learning in edge computing."

    "abstract": "Reducing parasitic parameters and thermal resistance is critical for advancing power electronic devices. This paper designs and evaluates the three Printed Circuit Board (PCB) embedded 1200 V SiC MOSFET half-bridge packaging cells, where the traditional wire bonding process is replaced by a re-distribution layer (RDL) technique. A comprehensive evaluation of their electrical performance, thermal management, and mechanical performance is conducted. The three solutions that employ panel, active metal brazing (AMB), and lead-frame carriers, are developed through a streamlined process that includes die attach, molding, drilling, plating, and etching. This packaging approach readily reduces the parasitic inductance to below 5 nH. By utilizing a single-layer RDL with mutual inductance cancellation, the power loop inductance is reduced to as low as 2.4 nH (at 10 MHz), and the gate loop inductance to 1.57 nH (at 10 MHz). The junction-to-case thermal resistances of the three solutions are 1.88 K/W, 1.03 K/W, and 0.73 K/W, respectively. Compared with the other two packaging cells, the cell selecting AMB as a carrier reduces SiC MOSFET operational stress and deformation by approximately 34% and 75%. The lead- frame carrier offers superior thermal dissipation for potential TO package replacement in half-bridge topologies, while the panel solution is promising for dual-sided cooling applications. With low thermal resistance, minimal stress, and excellent backside electrical insulation, the packaging cell with an AMB carrier is ideally suited for integration with heatsinks in traction inverters."

    "abstract": "This research work presents a compact, low-insertion-loss, and bias-free stub-loaded phase shifter with wideband characteristics operating in the X-band frequency range (10.4–11.4 GHz), termed the Magnetostatic-Responsive Stub-Loaded (MS-SL) Phase Shifter. The design consists of two cost-effective FR-4 substrates, with transmission lines placed on the top and bottom layers, and a slotted ground plane sandwiched between them. The coupled region incorporates two rectangular stubs which consists of Magneto Static Responsive Structures (MSRS) arranged in both horizontal and vertical configurations. Each MSRS cavity is filled with nano-magnetic particles (25 μm in size, containing 15% silver) and capped with copper on both ends. These structures are activated using small external magnets to achieve discrete phase shifts of 3°, 4°, 5°, 15°, 25°and 35°. For larger phase shifts 90°or 180° multiple MS-SL units can be cascaded. The proposed phase shifter is highly compact (13 mm × 5.65 mm) and achieves low insertion loss (~3 dB). It enables precise stepwise phase control through selective row-wise and column-wise activation of MSRS elements. Further, its RMS magnitude error across the operational band (10.4−11.4 GHz) lies between 0.3 and 0.5 dB, which is well within acceptable limits for practical RF applications. Similarly, the RMS phase error approaches 0° at 11 GHz and remains within 0°to 1.5°for all tested phase steps (3°, 4°, 5°) indicating high precision in phase-shifting performance. The proposed MS-SL phase shifter was analyzed using comprehensive mathematical modeling using MATLAB environment, ADS circuit simulations, and full-wave EM simulations in CST Microwave Studio Suit, with final validation through VNA measurements. These excellent matching results confirm its suitability for advanced RF applications, particularly beamforming antenna arrays, where precise and compact phase control is essential. Furthermore, the strong agreement between simulation and measurement underscores the robustness of the proposed MS-SL phase shifter and its practical potential for X-Band wireless and radar applications."

    "abstract": "Smart cities play an important role in leveraging the lifestyle of their citizens through the integration of information and communication technology (ICT). Most of the smart city applications, like intelligent traffic monitoring, smart emergency transportation, and IoT-based urban surveillance, depend on ICT in order to support intensive data transmission. The free space optical communication (FSO) system integrated with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered a potential approach to implement the aforementioned applications. This work focuses on UAV-based FSO communication for smart emergency transportation in smart cities. The key contribution of this proposed work is energy harvesting (EH) using simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) technology in UAVs in order to extend its lifetime for supporting the emergency services. The analysis is done by deriving an analytical equation considering atmospheric turbulence, pointing error, and angle of arrival (AoA) fluctuation. This study achieves a maximum average harvested power of about 72 mW. Hence, this study would help to establish a framework for autonomous and sustainable communication in smart cities. In addition to energy harvesting, the outage probability and average bit error rate (ABER) of the system are analyzed. The analytical results that are obtained are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations using MATLAB."

    "abstract": "An approach for generating frequency-hopping continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed microwave signals is proposed and demonstrated. It is based on an optoelectronic parametric oscillator (OEPO) that incorporates a tunable dual-passband filter, a microwave mixer and a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DDMZM). By injecting a single-tone signal with its frequency equal to the frequency difference between dominated modes in the two passbands into the mixer, parametric oscillation causes the two modes to occur alternatively in each round trip, generating regular or random frequency-hopping CW signals. By injecting another multi-tone signal with its repetition rate equal to the free spectral range of the OEPO cavity into the DDMZM, active mode locking is achieved, generating frequency-hopping pulsed microwave signals. Numerical simulation and experiment are implemented to verify the feasibility of the scheme. In the experiment, regular and random frequency-hopping CW and pulsed microwave signals within the X band (8-12 GHz) are generated, achieving a frequency-hopping time as low as ∼25 ns and a frequency-hopping rate exceeding 60000 hops/s. The two hopping frequencies are tunable across the X band, with phase noise levels between -130.60 dBc/Hz to -123.87 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset. This approach offers a flexible solution for generating multi-format frequency-hopping microwave signals over a broad frequency range, showing promising potential for anti-jamming radar and wireless communication applications."

We present Edge-Aware Reparameterizable Network for Compressed Image Super-Resolution (ERNCSR), a structurally reparameterizable network that couples efficiency at inference with high reconstruction fidelity. The core of ERNCSR is a lightweight multi-branch residual block that, during training, processes features through standard convolution, a fixed edge filter, and hybrid bottleneck branches to capture textures and sharp transitions. Before deployment these branches are algebraically fused into a single 3 × 3 kernel, collapsing the model to only 13.6K parameters and enabling over 20× speed-ups on consumer-grade CPUs. A spatial attention module further refines features while adding negligible overhead. Training follows a two-stage curriculum: we first learn on uncompressed bicubic data, then fine-tune with dynamically simulated JPEG, WebP, and AVIF degradations using a composite loss function. Extensive evaluations on uncompressed and compressed image variants of Set5, Set14, Urban100, DIV2K, and Manga109 demonstrate consistent gains in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS over comparably compact baselines, confirming ERNCSR’s suitability for realworld compressed image super-resolution."

    "abstract": "This letter focuses on the analysis and optimization of the bit mapping for low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) systems with high-order modulation. We propose the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis for LDPC-coded FTN systems based on the Ungerboeck observation model, where the vector-input and vector-output mutual information of the FTN detector is approximated using a suitably trained neural network (NN). Leveraging the EXIT chart, we optimize the bit mapping, i.e., the assignment of coded bits to the binary labeled constellation points, specifically for FTN systems. Through threshold analysis and simulations, it is shown that for an FTN system using a variant of the LDPC codes specified in the 5G standard, coded bits with highly reliable positions (information bits) in the Tanner graph preferentially to be transmitted over bit-wise sub-channels with higher capacity, while low-degree bits preferentially to be transmitted over bit-wise sub-channels with lower capacity. Numerical results show that: 1) the LDPC-coded FTN system with the optimized mapping outperforms those with random mappings, consistent with the proposed EXIT chart analysis; 2) under the same spectral efficiency, the LDPC-coded FTN system with optimized mapping also outperforms its 5G LDPC-coded Nyquist counterpart."

    "abstract": "Modern data-driven applications generate vast, complex data that often contain irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features. The task involves selecting the optimal subset of features from a dataset by removing redundant and irrelevant ones to enhance downstream performance. Using reinforcement learning (RL) for feature selection is ideal for data-centric tasks due to its interactive nature, which dynamically adapts to evolving data environments. However, high initial exploration variability, reliance on downstream tasks, and the need to control the false discovery rate bring challenges. To address these issues, we introduce a knockoff-guided RL framework, which uses pseudo-features to control early-stage randomness and matrix reconstruction for unsupervised reward. Our approach is a single-agent RL approach with unsupervised rewards that utilize knockoff information and matrix reconstruction to enhance feature selection without relying on labeled data. The framework integrates three components: the knockoff information to control exploration variability, decision network pre-training to guide RL policy, and matrix reconstruction to guide unsupervised rewards. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets across different task types, including classification and regression, demonstrating the superiority of our framework. Codes are available here."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulations effectively mitigate interference caused by path delays and Doppler shifts. However, they are unable to address Inter-Doppler Interference (IDI) resulting from time-varying Doppler, and both require supplementary precoding to mitigate Inter-User Interference (IUI) in multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) channels. This paper presents a general modulation technique for multi-dimensional channels, called Multi-dimensional Eigenwave Multiplexing (MEM), which employs jointly orthogonal Eigenwaves as subcarriers. These Eigenwaves are derived by decomposing the channel kernel based on Higher Order Mercer's Theorem (HOGMT), enabling simultaneous cancellation of interference across all Degrees of Freedom (DoF), including space, time-frequency, and Doppler-delay. MEM achieves diversity gain in the eigen domain and eliminates the need for additional precoding. Simulations on various rapidly time-varying and MU-MIMO channels demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude improvement in bit error rate (BER) compared to OTFS, validating the accuracy and generality of the proposed modulation."

To address this issue, we propose a novel Spectral Space Transformation and Loss adjustment (SSTL) method. Specifically, SSTL introduces a frequency-domain rotation-and-self-mixing strategy that adaptively balances perturbations across high- and low-frequency components, thereby generating more transferable adversarial examples. Furthermore, to mitigate semantic degradation during reconstruction, we design a logits fine-tuning mechanism that up-weights the logits of true labels while suppressing others, effectively preserving the original semantic information and avoiding misleading gradient propagation. Various experimental results demonstrate that SSTL effectively improves adversarial transferability while significantly preserving the semantic information of each image."

    "abstract": "With the advent of Industry 5.0, humans will again take center stage in decision-making processes, fully supported by artificial intelligence (AI). Drone technology has been adopted in the industry to permit efficient monitoring, detection, and avoidance of hazardous regions during industrial processes. It gives rise to a network architecture, namely industrial internet of drones (IIoD), that is controlled and managed by human expertise. Collaborative IIoD services are conducted by two or more parties in different domains, e.g., mining, construction, etc. Since the communications are carried out via public network channels, privacy and security issues, especially the risks of quantum computing, are of utmost importance. Existing cryptographic approaches encounter several disadvantages, e.g., security vulnerabilities, poor usability, etc. Moreover, no user authentication mechanisms in the literature could provide a countermeasure to quantum attacks for the above communication. Based on lattice-based cryptography (LBC), this paper proposes an anti-quantum cross-server authentication (AQCSA) protocol for securing cross-domain communication of the collaborative services. Our work is designed with a multi-factor authentication mechanism to protect cross-server user-to-user (CS-U2U) and cross-server user-to-drone (CS-U2D) communications. We conduct some practical implementations and experiments to evaluate the security and efficiency of the AQCSA. It is proven that the protocol can withstand various attacks while achieving a reasonable implementation cost in CS-IIoD environments."

    "abstract": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for securing Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) environments, where data privacy and scalability are major challenges for traditional centralized approaches. This study proposes a Federated Learning-based IDS (FL-IDS) that leverages a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for tabular data to detect cyber-attacks while preserving data confidentiality. To address class imbalance at the client level, we apply SMOTE locally before training. The system integrates a dynamic ensemble aggregation strategy combining Boosting with Top-K client selection, allowing the global model to adaptively weigh client contributions based on their performance history. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets—NSL-KDD, Edge-IIoTset and CICIDS2017 — under varying federation scales reveal that our approach consistently achieves high performance, with accuracy exceeding 98% and strong precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), while maintaining a minimal false alarm rate. The obtained results demonstrate the capability of dynamic ensemble aggregation in federated learning for developing privacy-preserving, scalable IDS solutions suitable for IoT and IIoT environments."

    "abstract": "To address the problems of flux linkage nonlinearity and reduce the cost of estimation in position estimation of sensorless switched reluctance motors (SRMs) at medium to high speeds, a sensorless SRM control scheme based on harmonic elimination and interval position estimation is proposed in this paper, In addition, a single-phase fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed to address the possible occurrence of single-phase faults. Firstly, the flux linkage -related quantity containing rotor position information is processed by Fourier expansion to obtain the flux linkage function. Then, by enhancing the harmonic signal elimination (HSE) operator, a multi-stage harmonic elimination flux observer (MSHE-FO) is designed, which enables the generation of a set of orthogonal flux linkage signals. Subsequently, the proposed interval search estimation (ISE) method is utilized to obtain the optimal estimated position. Furthermore, this paper proposes a single-phase fault-tolerant control strategy based on the logical relationship between the phase current and the phase winding operational mode. Finally, experiments are conducted on a six-phase 12/10 SRM experimental platform. The experimental result not only verifying that the proposed sensorless control strategy offers higher control accuracy than the conventional PLL method but also confirming the effectiveness of the fault-tolerant control strategy."

    "abstract": "Internet access is an enabler of many human rights, including the right to education, yet billions remain offline, particularly in remote and rural areas. In the Philippines, existing public Wi-Fi networks often depend on unsustainable subsidies. LokalFi addresses this gap through a communitydriven, voucher-based Wi-Fi framework designed for last-mile deployment in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas. This initiative aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG 4), providing universal and affordable access to the Internet (SDG 9), and making human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable (SDG 11). The LokalFi network offers internet connectivity and free access to onpremises applications tailored to community needs. Built using commercial-off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software, it features a customizable captive portal that also serves as a springboard for users to access the internet and local content. The LokalFi network was deployed in four rural communities through collaborative site selection and spectrum analysis. Field tests in mountainous terrain showed coverage radius of 450 meters, and post-deployment survey results indicate improved educational access and digital inclusion. The framework shows potential to scale sustainably with local stakeholder involvement and may extend to healthcare and disaster management use cases."

This paper analyzes the role of large model in data integration and analysis, intelligent decision support, knowledge base construction and update, and man-machine cooperation mechanism, and takes a large hydropower station in China as a practical case to show the application practice of large model technology. By constructing a hydrological forecasting model that includes Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) power demand forecasting model, and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing generator scheduling, the intelligence and precision of hydropower scheduling have been achieved. In the human-machine collaboration mode, human dispatchers work closely with large model systems to jointly complete hydroelectric dispatch tasks, significantly improving dispatch efficiency and economic benefits. The research results indicate that the application of large models has improved the economic benefits and environmental sustainability of hydropower stations, verifying their effectiveness and importance in hydropower scheduling optimization."

    "abstract": "The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sensor data analysis is an emerging and impactful direction of research, which combines natural language reasoning with time-series and physical-world signals. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in applying LLMs to understand, reason about, and generate sensor data across domains such as health monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT). We categorize existing work by their input modalities, including raw signals, textual summaries, and visual prompts, as well as their application domains and technical strategies such as prompt engineering, sensor-text alignment, and hybrid frameworks. Despite encouraging results in low-dimensional and API-supported tasks, LLMs still struggle with complex signal processing and numerical reasoning, as well as multimodal sensor fusion. We also identify key challenges such as limited dataset availability, inadequate signal transformation, and the need for architectural adaptations. Future research directions are outlined to bridge these gaps. Our review emphasizes the potential of LLMs to serve as foundation models for analyzing sensor data, while also pointing out the importance of domainspecific knowledge and diverse modalities."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, more and more undergraduate students in Indonesia are turning to generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to help with their academic work, especially as digital access becomes increasingly effortless and widespread. This study incorporates trust propensity and privacy fatigue into the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model to better understand the key factors influencing students’ intention to use such tools. Data were collected through a quantitative survey involving 198 students from various academic disciplines. The results reveal that students' intention to use the technology is strongly shaped by how useful and easy they believe it is, with performance expectancy having the biggest impact. Students with a higher tendency to trust see the technology as more helpful and easier to operate, indirectly influencing their decision to use it. There are also some insignificant paths, which include privacy fatigue and the direct effect of trust propensity on behavioral intention. Thus, students appear to prioritize the expected benefit and simplicity of use over privacy, underscoring the need to enhance usability, build trust, and promote greater digital privacy awareness in Indonesia."

From the architecture of control proposed by Lawrence, we synthesized two structures about control of tele operation position-force whose only position of the master devise is transmitted to the slave devise. Conversely, the slave devise transmits to the operator only the effort that it applies to the environment. The first structure is equipped with two controllers PI. The first controller is used in order to control the effort of the master devise and the second to control the position on the level of the slave devise. In the second structure, we replaced regulators PI of the first structure by two controllers neuro-fuzzy of structure ANFIS. A co-simulation is carried out combining Matlab/Simulink and PSIM environments in order to validate the control algorithms for the proposed tele operation system, through numerical simulation that show the performances and the robustness of the controllers proposed."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficits in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and atypical sensory processing. Traditional therapies, while effective, often face barriers such as limited availability of trained therapists, high costs, and inconsistent access. To address these challenges, this paper presents an AI-driven multimodal therapeutic framework that integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and sketch-based interpretation models to deliver affordable, scalable, and personalized ASD therapy. The proposed system comprises three modules: (i) a behavior therapy module leveraging pose estimation and emotion recognition to guide social skill acquisition, (ii) a speech therapy module utilizing lip-reading and speech-text alignment for articulation training, and (iii) an interpretation therapy module employing sketch recognition to foster creativity and conceptual understanding. Using datasets such as COCO (for pose estimation), QuickDraw (for sketch learning), and curated speech corpora, the system demonstrates competitive accuracy in activity recognition, word pronunciation scoring, and drawing similarity assessment. Experimental results highlight the framework's capacity to deliver consistent therapy sessions, achieve quantifiable progress tracking, and provide explainable feedback to caregivers and clinicians. This work represents a step toward AI-enabled precision therapies that bridge accessibility gaps and augment humancentered care."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of Indonesian ecommerce platforms has created unprecedented challenges in merchant credibility assessment, where consumers struggle to efficiently process vast amounts of unstructured review data. The study addresses the fundamental research question of how automated sentiment analysis frameworks can address the critical gap between large-scale review volumes and reliable merchant evaluation in Indonesian e-commerce ecosystems. This investigation presents a comprehensive comparative study implementing multiple machine learning approaches for sentiment classification of Tokopedia reviews. The research methodology encompasses systematic web scraping, advanced text preprocessing with object detection and noise removal techniques, and comparative evaluation of Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest classifiers. Class imbalance handling strategies including SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning were implemented to address inherent data distribution challenges. Evaluation on 450 Indonesian-language reviews reveals that while Naïve Bayes achieves 83% accuracy with exceptional positive sentiment precision (0.93), ensemble methods demonstrate superior balanced performance across sentiment classes. The Random Forest classifier achieved 89% overall accuracy with improved negative sentiment detection (F1-score: 0.45 vs. 0.20 for Naïve Bayes). These findings establish the practical viability of automated sentiment frameworks for large-scale merchant evaluation while highlighting the critical importance of algorithm selection and data balancing strategies in achieving equitable classification performance."

The features and content of product reviews on e-commerce provide confidence for potential buyers to make transactions after reading testimonials from other buyers. This study seeks to determine the factors that influence users' intentions to use the product review feature and determine the influence of suspicious review content on purchasing decisions in e-commerce. Data collected from 369 respondents and proceed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. This study shows that the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness influences the intention to use the review feature to complete shopping transactions. The suspicion of review content is proven to influence user attitudes towards e-commerce and user attitudes towards product brands to be negative. This attitude does not influence the intention to use the review feature to complete shopping transactions because suspicious review content does not always represent the collective experience of all buyers. This study provides guidance to e-commerce organizations to manage their online review features to increase e-commerce transactions."

The deterministic network environment requires the network to have high reliability and low delay characteristics to ensure the real-time and accuracy of key tasks. A general framework of resource scheduling strategy for 5G slicing is proposed, which consists of demand awareness module, resource evaluation module, intelligent decision-making module and execution monitoring module. The strategy follows the three principles of personalized customization, dynamic adjustment and fairness and rationality, supports highly personalized slice configuration, and has the ability of real-time adjustment to ensure the fairness and rationality of resource allocation. The simulation results show that the strategy is effective under different network traffic conditions, especially in the scene of sudden high traffic, which can quickly redistribute resources, reduce resource waste and effectively avoid network congestion and performance bottlenecks."

Three guest domains were configured representing a gateway, ADAS controller, and legacy ECU simulator. Load testing with 10-100 concurrent connections revealed that SOVD-to-UDS conversion exhibits higher response times than Native SOVD. CPU utilization analysis revealed that Native SOVD maintained substantially higher usage compared to SOVD-to-UDS, indicating I/O wait times as the primary bottleneck rather than computational overhead.

Axles are weighed at the weighing area, but the axle overload is not taken into account [1], [3], [5]. It’s in this perspective, we proposed to set up a remotely connected on-board weighing system to overcome some of the limitations of the LS-WIM (Low Speed Weight-In-Motion) systems currently installed of our roads and motorways. In order to carry out this work, we begin by reviewing existing weighing systems and proposing alternative solutions. Next, we propose an overall system architecture (organic vision) with the design of the associated platform. Finally, we simulate the system using electronic/electrotechnical software and carry out implementation tests."

    "abstract": "Acne is a skin condition that commonly affects young individuals and can cause permanent scars, emotional stress, and physical discomfort. Current dermatologist treatment is still manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, a lightweight, artificial intelligence-based acne localization model that can be implemented on devices with limited resources is needed. This implementation can reduce treatment time for dermatologists. Therefore, this study proposes the YOLOv11nMod model, a modification of YOLOv11n that has fewer parameters and layers than the original version. Our proposed model was tested using 5-fold K-Fold Cross Validation. The data used in this study came from Kaggle in the form of acne facial images. Data preparation was carried out and resulted in 915 image data and 915 txt data. The test data for the data split was 183 data points, with the remainder for training on K-Fold Cross Validation. From the test results, which were conducted by averaging the accuracy of 5 times, our proposed model achieved a detection accuracy of 66.64%. 3.34% Superior to YOLOv12n and 0.02% lower than YOLOv11n and 0.42% lower than YOLOv8n. Although the accuracy obtained is 0.42% lower, our model has a smaller size, namely 1.7 MB, compared to the YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n, and YOLOv12n models. Thus, our proposed model is more efficient than the original version with a similar accuracy. Therefore, our proposed model can be implemented on devices with limited resources. However, the accuracy of external data testing is still very low. Therefore, additional data is needed in future research."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (DHRL) framework for reliable task scheduling in MEC-enabled 5G Open RAN systems under on-off jamming attacks. The scheduling problem is modeled as a combinatorial integer nonlinear program (ComINP), which is hard to solve directly. To handle this, we use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Since the jamming environment is only partially observable, the problem becomes a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). To deal with this, we split the problem into two DRL agents. The first agent is a jamming estimator that uses an Alternating Discrete Phase-Type Renewal Process (ADPHRP) to predict jammed time slots based on dense distribution patterns. It is trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The second agent is a task scheduler called Weighted MAC-based Task Scheduler (WMAC-TS), which schedules tasks during non-jammed slots while maintaining quality of service (QoS). It uses a transformer-based Actor-Critic model with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks, considering both short-term and long-term rewards. Simulation results show that the PPO-based jamming estimator achieves a cumulative prediction error of 13 time slots in 100 time slots, compared to 25 time slots for DDQN with historical data and 48 time slots for standard DDQN. For 50 active users, WMAC-TS achieves a task drop ratio of 0.917 lower than the 0.942 of the baseline genetic algorithm, and cuts execution time from 1260 seconds to 316 seconds."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for designing waveforms for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based joint radar-communication (JRC) systems that simultaneously minimizes the sidelobes of the ambiguity function and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal. Modern JRC systems require QAM-based OFDM to support higher data rates. However, the non-unimodular nature of QAM symbols leads to higher sidelobe levels in the ambiguity function, degrading radar sensing performance, and OFDM inherently suffers from the high PAPR. Thus, to achieve effective radar sensing and reliable communication, we propose a waveform design method that simultaneously minimizes sidelobe levels within a specified region of the ambiguity function and the PAPR of the waveform. The resulting problem is non-convex with a quartic objective function, which we address using an iterative method based on quadratic approximations of the quartic terms. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed technique significantly reduces ambiguity function sidelobes and PAPR, thereby enhancing radar detection performance and maintaining communication reliability compared to recent methods in the literature."

    "abstract": "Robot path planning is challenged by issues including inadequate operating speed and environmental adaptability. In path planning, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method has been widely adopted as an efficient and effective approach. However, because of its single particle update method, PSO finds it difficult to strike a compromise between search capability and convergence speed. To address this, a dynamic multi-strategy particle swarm optimization algorithm (DMSPSO) is proposed. First, collision severity is embedded into the path cost to establish the algorithm’s optimization objective. Second, a particle updating strategy based on dynamic hierarchical mechanisms is proposed. Particles are divided into three groups using this method: elite, common, and backward. Their respective roles are then dynamically changed according to fitness. Third, a multi-strategy algorithm is proposed to leverage the positional characteristics of particles in different groups. For the elite group, an improved Hooke-Jeeves pattern search strategy is employed, facilitating small-step exploration in the vicinity of optimal solutions to accelerate convergence. For the common group, an attraction-repulsion search strategy is implemented, introducing a dynamic potential field to facilitate oscillatory fine-grained searches in optimal neighborhoods. For the backward group, a mirror search strategy enhances global exploration capabilities, preventing convergence to local optima. Simulation results in CEC2022 test functions and obstacle environments indicate that the DMSPSO algorithm possesses enhanced global search capability and faster operation speed. Under four different complex environments, DMSPSO converges 37.66% faster than other algorithms, and the length of the converged path is shortened by 13.08%, which can plan a better path faster. Experiments in real obstacle environments further prove the effectiveness of the method."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">discriminative power</i> in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs. Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">node matching properties</i> such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment.

Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure these matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "Flight procedures are essential to the safety and efficiency of air traffic management. However, due to the highly specialized nature of the flight procedure design process, existing methods rely heavily on manual operations and adjustments with limited automation, resulting in inefficiencies and potential safety risks. This study introduces AutoFPDesigner, a new agent-driven approach to flight procedure design, leveraging large language models (LLMs). By utilizing multi-agent collaboration, AutoFPDesigner automates Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) procedures, enabling end-to-end automation. In this framework, the designer’s role shifts from an executor to a supervisor, issuing tasks through natural language, while the system integrates specialized knowledge and uses a toolset to complete the design. Experimental results show that procedures designed with this approach meet safety requirements nearly 100%, with 75% of tasks completed in a limited number of steps. Moreover, AutoFPDesigner performs effectively across various design tasks, outperforming existing methods. Additionally, this study conducted human interaction experiments and introduced an “instruction-based” feedback method to address agent misinterpretation of human feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that the system bridges the skill gap between experts and beginners, and that the “instruction-based” feedback method enhances the accuracy of agent feedback interpretation.

Evidence of interference sources and their signal properties is first presented using CYGNSS’s special raw I/F acquisition mode. The associated Level-1 data is shown to require additional processing steps to provide information on the RFI contained. A “EIRP correlation” approach combined with a spatial anomaly clustering method is developed and applied to CYGNSS Level-1 noise floor data extending from August 1st, 2019 to April 1st, 2025 to produce a daily radio frequency interference (RFI) product on a ≈10 km grid and to geolocate the sources contained. The results reveal more than 25 unique GPS L1-band interferers over the analysis period, with the majority located within the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region as well as Myanmar. Use of the method for detecting and geolocating interference sources beyond CYGNSS’s nominal northernmost 38°N latitude coverage is also demonstrated. The results highlight how GNSS-R observations can be instrumental in monitoring and understanding the GNSS RFI environment."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) offers collaborative model training across multiple decentralized devices without the need to share data directly, enhancing privacy and data security. However, FL systems are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients inject poisoned weights during training. Existing defenses, primarily based on anomaly detection, are prone to erroneous rejections of normal weights while accepting poisoned ones, largely due to shortcomings in quantifying similarities among client models. Furthermore, other defenses demonstrate effectiveness only when dealing with a limited number of malicious clients, typically fewer than 10%. To alleviate these vulnerabilities, we present G<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>uardFL, a protective framework that translates the detection of malicious clients into an attributed graph clustering problem, thus safeguarding FL systems. Specifically, this framework employs a client graph clustering approach to identify malicious clients and integrates an adaptive mechanism to amplify the discrepancy between the aggregated model and the poisoned ones, effectively eliminating embedded backdoors. Through empirical evaluation, comparing G<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>uardFL with cutting-edge defenses, such as FLAME (USENIX Security 2022) [37] and DeepSight (NDSS 2022) [43], against various backdoor attacks, including 3DFed (SP 2023) [26], our results demonstrate its significant effectiveness in mitigating backdoor attacks while having a negligible impact on the aggregated model’s performance on benign samples (i.e., the primary task performance). For instance, in an FL system with 25% malicious clients, G<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>uardFL reduces the attack success rate to 10.61%, while maintaining a primary task performance of 80.98% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    "abstract": "We contribute an in-depth analysis of the workflows and tensions arising from generative AI (genAI) use in biomedical visualization (BioMedVis). Although genAI affords facile production of aesthetic visuals for biological and medical content, the architecture of these tools fundamentally limits the accuracy and trustworthiness of the depicted information, from imaginary (or fanciful) molecules to alien anatomy. Through 17 interviews with a diverse group of practitioners and researchers, we qualitatively analyze the concerns and values driving genAI (dis)use for the visual representation of spatially-oriented biomedical data. We find that BioMedVis experts, both in roles as developers and designers, use genAI tools at different stages of their daily workflows and hold attitudes ranging from enthusiastic adopters to skeptical avoiders of genAI. In contrasting the current use and perspectives on genAI observed in our study with predictions towards genAI in the visualization pipeline from prior work, we refocus the discussion of genAI's effects on projects in visualization in the here and now with its respective opportunities and pitfalls for future visualization research. At a time when public trust in science is in jeopardy, we are reminded to first do no harm, not just in biomedical visualization but in science communication more broadly. Our observations reaffirm the necessity of human intervention for empathetic design and assessment of accurate scientific visuals."

    "abstract": "Bowden cables offer flexible, compact, and long-distance force transmission, but they suffer from dead zones and hysteresis due to cable compliance and friction. This study improves the transmission efficiency and accuracy of Bowden cables in two key ways: 1) A general multicable transmission path optimization method is proposed to reduce overall hysteresis at its source. This method is based on parametric configurations and a Cosserat-based shape model with any fixed endpoints. 2) An asymmetric and nonlinear tension model is developed for forward tension estimation and inverse hysteresis compensation. The model integrates an improved Bouc–Wen model with simplified parameters and a long short-term memory network driven by the smoothing loss of fused data. Finally, the tension model, when applied to the optimized transmission path, achieves higher accuracy and better generalization than other methods across various datasets, particularly in strong hysteresis. The hybrid advantages of the tension model also allow it to maintain adaptability for transfer learning. Experiments on typical Bowden cable-driven manipulators with 2 and 12 segments show a 2.5 times improvement in transmission efficiency after optimization and an 82.5% reduction in motion error after compensation, providing new insights into high-performance Bowden cable actuation systems."

    "abstract": "To address the limited feature representation capability of existing time-frequency methods in analyzing non-stationary vibration signals and the inability of fixed transforms to capture dynamic characteristics of bearing faults, this paper proposes a dual-channel deep learning model integrating time-domain and fractional-domain features. The time-domain channel employs multi-scale convolutions with varying kernel sizes to simultaneously capture both fine-grained transient impulses and coarse-grained temporal patterns. The fractional-domain channel systematically processes nine-order fractional Fourier transforms, where temporal convolutional networks extract complex temporal dependencies through dilated causal convolutions, and channel attention mechanisms adaptively weight different fractional orders to enhance discriminative features while suppressing redundancy. This dual-channel architecture achieves synergistic modeling of both transient temporal information and non-stationary fractional-domain energy distributions, overcoming the limitations of traditional single-domain and fixed time-frequency resolution methods. Experimental validation on CWRU and SUFD datasets demonstrates superior diagnostic performance compared to existing advanced methods, with comprehensive ablation studies, multi-condition scenarios, and noise robustness tests confirming the method’s effectiveness and robustness for intelligent maintenance of rotating machinery."

This study introduces a robust feature engineering methodology that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in Bitcoin trend classification across multiple temporal granularities. Our approach, which systematically combines temporal variables with recalibrated technical indicators, was refined through rigorous hyperparameter optimization and forecasting horizon standardization. These methodological improvements unlocked remarkable predictive power, particularly at fine-grained intervals, demonstrating a relative accuracy improvement of up to 73% over established benchmarks. Through a comprehensive evaluation against two seminal studies using over 20 machine learning models, we demonstrate that our approach is effective at 5-minute, 15-minute, and 1-hour granularities, achieving a peak accuracy of 91.9% with a RandomForest model at the 5-minute level. This result challenges the conventional view that high-frequency data is too noisy for reliable trend prediction. A key finding is that intelligent feature engineering, when paired with appropriate model selection, surpasses the performance of more complex deep learning architectures, which consistently underperformed in our tests. The superior performance of tree-based ensemble methods highlights the synergy between our tabular feature set and these algorithms. This methodology provides immediate practical value for algorithmic trading and risk management, offering a validated, high-performance framework. Our study provides a complete and reproducible guide, from theoretical justification to empirical validation, establishing a new, robust baseline for cryptocurrency market analysis."

However, existing exact unlearning methods suffer from either low efficiency or poor model performance. While more utility-preserving and efficient, current approximate methods require access to the forget set during unlearning, which makes them inapplicable in immediate deletion scenarios, thereby undermining privacy. Additionally, these approximate methods, which attempt to directly perturb model parameters, still raise significant concerns regarding unlearning power in empirical studies. To fill the gap, we propose Transferable Condensation Graph Unlearning (TCGU), a data-centric solution to graph unlearning. Specifically, we first develop a two-level alignment strategy to pre-condense the original graph into a compact yet utility-preserving dataset for subsequent unlearning tasks. Upon receiving an unlearning request, we fine-tune the pre-condensed data with a low-rank plugin, to directly align its distribution with the remaining graph, thus efficiently revoking the information of deleted data without accessing them. A novel similarity distribution matching approach and a discrimination regularizer are proposed to effectively transfer condensed data and preserve its utility in GNN training, respectively. Finally, we retrain the GNN on the transferred condensed data. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmark datasets demonstrate that TCGU can achieve superior performance in terms of model utility, unlearning efficiency, and unlearning efficacy compared to existing GU methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore graph unlearning with immediate data removal using a data-centric approximate method."

    "abstract": "In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has attracted significant attention as an algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems that are classically intractable. Various modifications and training strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of QAOA. However, as the circuit depth increases, existing methods encounter greater training difficulty and reach a barren plateau in performance improvements. In this paper, we propose the Smart Insert Layerwise QAOA (SIL QAOA) to overcome these challenges. In SIL QAOA, at each stage, a new layer is inserted into all possible positions; each circuit is independently optimized, and the parameter set from the circuit yielding the highest expectation value is adopted as the initial parameter for the next stage. Applying the proposed method to the MaxCut problem, we achieved up to approximately 11% higher approximation ratios compared to conventional Layerwise learning QAOA, while successfully mitigating early performance saturation observed at shallow depths. These results demonstrate the superior performance improvement capability of SIL QAOA. Furthermore, we also discuss its potential applicability to more complex optimization problems and deeper variational quantum circuits in future work."

    "abstract": "Implementation of autonomous driving requires location recognition, lane detection, and distance information collection of other vehicles. Information collected from human senses (eyes, ears, touch, etc.) travels to the brain to recognize, judge, and control it. The ultimate goal is to implant this process into the vehicle as it is. Humans recognize distance by calibrating information obtained through both eyes in the brain. To implement this, we collect information about objects using two sensors, camera and LiDAR. Cameras have strengths in object recognition and resolution, and LiDAR has strengths in distance information collection. The fusion of these sensors maximizes their respective strengths, enabling effective detection of obstacles around the vehicle. This is much more effective than systems that rely on a single sensor or whose sensor settings are not properly calibrated or synchronized. Systems based on a single sensor are vulnerable to problems such as object clogging, visually similar items. This can lead to excessive avoidance behavior, unnecessary pauses or obstacle recognition errors. In this work, a combination of camera-LiDAR early fusion, dual-condition gating, and risk-level classification (level 1 = speed bump, level 2 = vehicle, level 3 = human) can improve avoidance success rate and driving consistency compared to single sensor-based control algorithms while reducing unnecessary responses."

    "abstract": "Distribution networks (DNs) are usually designed in a ring configuration but operate radially. In a typical structure, normally open points (NOs) are used to create alternative paths and supply un-faulted loads after fault clearance. A soft open point (SOP) is a power electronic device that can enhance DN performance under normal and fault conditions. However, its impact on protection algorithms has been less considered in the literature. So far, a few methods have been suggested to detect fault type and estimate fault location in the presence of SOP; however, those methods have poor performance when fault resistance is not neglected and are not effective for ungrounded DNs as well. In this paper, a new method is proposed to overcome these obstacles that significantly improves fault locating and protection performance."

This paper presents the development of a digital literacy curriculum designed specifically for rural women under the SANKALP project, an initiative by Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in collaboration with the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). Using the AWESOME (Advancing Women's Empowerment through Systems Oriented Model Expansion) framework, the curriculum aims to empower women by building practical digital skills in smartphone use, internet navigation, and digital tools for business and livelihood development. The curriculum is integrated into vocational education to enhance employability and entrepreneurial potential. Key components include modules on technology access, awareness-building, and hands-on application of digital tools for daily life and small enterprises. Beyond technical skills, the program focuses on building confidence and agency, enabling women to overcome cultural and societal barriers. This innovative approach not only supports digital adoption but also promotes sustainable livelihoods. The paper highlights how the curriculum contributes to reducing the digital gender divide and offers a replicable model for advancing digital inclusion and women's empowerment in other rural communities across India."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a short-range wireless communication technology commonly used for identification and data exchange. However, numerous studies have highlighted that traditional RFID authentication protocols often fail to meet the security demands of mobile RFID systems. To address these limitations, Li recently proposed an efficient mobile RFID authentication protocol based on a parity repair operation. This operation is lightweight and well-suited for RFID environments. Nevertheless, Li’s protocol assumes that the Reader, Tag, and Server all share a common private key—an assumption that is impractical in real-world deployments. In typical RFID systems, a single server communicates with multiple readers and numerous tags. If a Reader were to store the private keys of all Tags, compromising or stealing that Reader would not only lead to significant storage overhead but also pose a serious security threat to the entire system. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an improvement to Li’s protocol by modifying the key management mechanism. Specifically, private keys are shared only between the Server and each Tag, and separately between the Server and each Reader. This design enhances the security and practicality of the RFID system while maintaining protocol efficiency."

Among these stages, the situation prediction scheme is the most challenging and valuable. With the accurate prediction, the security status development in network in time, the traditional defense tools, e.g. the invasion detection, could facilitate a transition from passive to active defense. Consequently, NSSA prediction has become a crucial research focus. NSSA estimation and prediction are accentuated toward a systematical model establishment. This study emphasizes model development for NSSA estimation and prediction. Leveraging domain expertise and data science, the estimation model applies logical reasoning based on the Dempster–Shafer theory to identify critical predictive factors. Prediction is framed as a pattern recognition problem, addressed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm. Performance evaluation uses credibility metrics for estimation and accuracy rates for prediction. Simulation experiments with training and testing datasets assess sensitivity coefficients and refine control factors for prediction. The goal is to develop a robust NSSA prediction scheme that enhances overall network security."

After the collection of 301 valid responses, this research utilized PLS-SEM or Partial Least Square Structural Equation to examine key variables influencing behavioral intention, namely attitude toward using, social influence, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Results show that all proposed relations achieved the threshold for t-value and p-value, respectively above 1.96 and below 0.05, validating all hypotheses and concluding that social influence affects how useful and convenient technology is perceived to be. The relationship between perceptions of convenience, usefulness, and entertainment is validated as well. Notably, the link between user attitude and intention is 0.904, slightly exceeding the Heterotrait-Monotrait threshold of 0.9 and suggesting a potential overlap between constructs. The results provide useful insights into how gamification performs in education, offering meaningful contribution to the discussion of gamified learning and the key variables behind its adoption in introductory programming courses."

The importance of analyzing MSMEs is useful for knowing the level of conditions of the distribution of MSMEs in each region. In this study, we propose to cluster MSME data using the K-Prototype method with center point initialization using the Cao method, where the centroids are obtained from data density and the distance between objects. By using the silhouette method, the highest accuracy is obtained, with a value of 0.838 in 2 clusters. This is 0.109 higher than the Analytical Hierarchy Clustering method. Meanwhile, using the Elbow method, the best number of clusters is obtained in 5 clusters with a silhouette value of 0.233. The clustering results show that MSMEs in the service sector still need to increase their annual turnover, which on average is still below 10 million with marketing locations still having to be expanded outside the region and promotional media increased using e-commerce."

In GPS-denied environments such as indoor and underground parking lots, conventional methods based on LiDAR or high-precision Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) present significant cost challenges. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an infrastructure-centric 2D vehicle pose (position and orientation) estimation system, named VISTA, that utilizes only multiple low-cost, CCTV-grade cameras. The proposed system first integrates multiple camera images into a single global Bird's-Eye View (BEV) map via homography transformation. Subsequently, it robustly estimates the vehicle's pose, even under partial occlusion, by applying a hierarchical keypoint-based algorithm that leverages the vehicle's structural features. Finally, to satisfy both the rapid responsiveness and stability required for vehicle control, a hybrid filtering strategy is employed, combining a responsiveness-focused Kalman Filter with a moving average filter. Experiments conducted in a Gazebo simulation environment confirmed that the proposed system achieves centimeter-level position accuracy and sub-degree orientation accuracy, suggesting that VISTA can serve as an effective and economical alternative to existing high-cost solutions."

    "abstract": "Railroad crossties are paramount to ensuring structural integrity and passenger safety. Traditional inspection methods have been a manually intensive process, subject to fatigue, bias, and human error, prompting an inquiry into more consistent and expedited inspection modalities. Automated defect detection leveraging deep learning and computer vision can drastically reduce diagnostic time and ensure prompt maintenance intervention. This paper evaluates two contrasting state-of-the-art object detection models, You Only Look Once (YOLOv11, the latest release from Ultralytics) and Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), for automating detection of defective ties, marking the first competitive benchmarking within this domain. This study uses real, field-test footage collected on stretches of railroads that was standardized and preprocessed for normalization to form our dataset, consisting of 500 annotated frames across three distinct classes: wood checks, decay, and ties. Both models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation and evaluated based on the F1 score, Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at varying IoU thresholds. YOLOv11 outperformed RT-DETR in all metrics except Recall (0.9104 vs. 0.9119), achieving an F1 score of 0.9400, mAP50 of 0.9530, and mAP50-95 of 0.9014. These results suggest that YOLOv11 is effective not only in defect recognition but also in spatial localization at various precision thresholds, fostering higher safety standards in the process. This makes it a strong candidate for deployment on lightweight mobile or embedded platforms, representative of real-world use cases. Overall, this research demonstrates the robust utility of deep learning for enhanced infrastructure monitoring, reducing inspection time and labor costs while heightening passenger safety and mitigating derailment risks, with future work needed to assess performance under varied lighting, weather, and tie conditions."

KoMaP’s next-experiment recommendation engine uses a Gaussian-process surrogate with calibrated uncertainty to propose feasible batches under domain constraints (e.g., ternary compositional sum-to-100%, low-temperature processing windows) and constrained acquisitions (EI/UCB; c-EHVI for multi-objective runs). Practical features—spreadsheet I/O, auditable logs, and SHAP-based interpretability—lower adoption barriers while preserving transparency and traceability. We prototype the service in Streamlit and demonstrate it on a 10-round perovskite stability optimization, where the loop rapidly concentrates on low-instability regions and reduces experiment count versus grid/random baselines, all while honoring CE-relevant limits. Beyond single-objective stability, KoMaP supports multi-objective optimization (e.g., stability–efficiency–Tmax–cycle-time–cost), exposing Pareto candidates and user-steerable preferences for CE trade-off decisions. Finally, we outline an extension from lab to line toward battery electrode AI autonomous manufacturing: KoMaP’s recommendations and uncertainty metrics feed quality-prediction and productivity objectives on the shop floor, enabling factory-in-the-loop optimization and compatibility with future robotic execution. Together, KoMaP bridges advanced AL–BO methods and everyday experimental practice, empowering CE-oriented materials R&D to \"learn more from fewer experiments\" without disrupting existing workflows."

Secondly, in order to deal with the uncertainties in the planting process, this paper established a robust optimization model, which only considered the return maximization in the worst case and introduced the loss rate index of high-risk crops to reduce the planting area of this type of crops. Finally, this paper uses the K-means clustering algorithm to classify crops, analyze the substitutability and complementarity between crops, and combine the random forest algorithm to predict crop sales volume to further optimize the planting strategy. The research results show that by optimizing planting strategy, the economic benefits can be guaranteed while the planting risks can be effectively reduced."

Existing deep learning models frequently struggle to achieve high precision owing to their disregard for underlying physical mechanisms, a deficiency that undermines their reliability in real-world applications. To tackle these challenges, we propose NODE, a framework for PM2.5 concentration prediction that integrates the advection partial differential equations with neural ordinary differential equations, which conceptualizes the spatiotemporal evolution of air pollutants as a closed-system dynamic process governed by advection dynamics. Specifically, a second-order residual neural network is engineered to model flow velocity, while the partial differential equations are discretized via the method of lines and solved using numerical solvers. Spatiotemporal features are systematically encoded through trigonometric time embedding, latitude-longitude encoding, and static spatiotemporal covariates. These methodologies effectively address the limitations of traditional deep learning's black-box paradigm and inadequate physical mechanism integration. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms methods without incorporating physical information in prediction accuracy, offering a robust solution to air quality challenges in practical environmental settings."

In this paper, a solution for accurate positioning of assembled building components is proposed based on image recognition technology, and an assembly path optimization method is designed by combining intelligent algorithms. By constructing a mathematical model and introducing improved algorithms, this paper comprehensively optimizes the assembly path of components, which effectively improves the construction efficiency and accuracy. Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed method is better than the traditional method in terms of positioning accuracy and path optimization effect, and has been verified in actual engineering cases. The integration and application of image recognition technology and intelligent algorithm in assembled buildings can significantly improve the level of construction automation and intelligence, and provide new ideas and technical support for the development of assembled buildings."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a low-cost testbed and quantitative evaluation methodology that assesses the performance of small-sized inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor modules. Existing IMU performance verification required expensive specialized equipment, posing an economic burden for small-scale developers. We used the LSM6DSV from the Samsung Galaxy S25+ as the reference sensor and the BMI270 IMU from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 as the evaluation target. A testbed was constructed using 3D printing and commercial components. Gyroscope data was collected by applying identical rotational motion to both sensors. Quantitative evaluation of signal similarity via cross-correlation analysis shows that a cross-correlation coefficient exceeds 0.90 when applying a 10Hz low-pass filter, confirming the importance of software filtering. While limited to single-axis rotation evaluation, our proposed testbed contributes to lowering the barrier to entry for IMU-based system development by providing an economical alternative for developers to independently verify sensor performance."

    "abstract": "Automated generation of single line diagrams (SLDs) from power distribution network Geographic Information System (GIS) data remains a computational challenge requiring efficient algorithms that can handle networks of varying complexity. A novel smart bottom-up heuristic approach is developed to address these challenges through a comprehensive seven-phase methodology. The proposed pipeline addresses key challenges in existing SLD generation algorithms by implementing a comprehensive seven-phase methodology that efficiently handles networks of varying scales while maintaining superior computational performance. The algorithm integrates connectivity and topological network data through a systematic workflow beginning with data preprocessing and busbar subsystem extraction, followed by global network construction using shortest path analysis between busbar pairs weighted by Euclidean distances. A critical innovation lies in the component analysis phase, which identifies electrically isolated subnetworks to prevent impossible connection attempts, followed by a topology-based connection algorithm employing a Hybrid Multi-Criteria Approach that combines betweenness, closeness, and degree centrality metrics to optimize starting point selection. The pipeline’s advanced crossing avoidance mechanism utilizes computational geometry techniques to generate clean orthogonal connections through sophisticated routing algorithms that systematically evaluate multiple path strategies including elbow-shaped and three-segment routes with strategic offsets. Missing line detection ensures comprehensive network representation by identifying secondary connections for redundant paths and backup routes, while the final visualization phase maintains professional electrical drafting standards through standardized symbols and consistent scaling."

However, they are threatened by a large range of defects and contamination sources. Traditional inspection methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited in scope. To address the challenges posed, this work makes use of machine learning and computer vision for detecting and classifying aquatic defects in underwater imagery. We used the EfficientNet-B2 architecture, chosen for its accuracy, efficiency, and balance in classification problems. We applied it to a curated dataset of 2,228 underwater images. The dataset was preprocessed and prepared to reduce bias and avoid overfitting, as we aimed to create a local and generalized model. Misclassified images were further refined into a separate test set. The model was trained using PyTorch, and it reached a high accuracy of over 97 % during training. It also performed strongly on the test set. This paper shows how the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision applications can help automate underwater inspections despite design constraints. It offers a more scalable, practical, and reproducible baseline for a sustainable way to protect aquatic ecosystems. As part of the International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2024), the model was tested and validated in the Machine Vision Innovation (MVI) Tournament [1]. The system performed strongly, earning second place."

    "abstract": "In the roaming scenario of different networks, the base station needs to support multi-operator network access and handover, and the energy consumption is further aggravated. Dynamic shutdown technology can dynamically shut down some base stations or functions according to the network load, and intelligent scheduling technology uses artificial intelligence algorithm to optimize the resource allocation of base stations. The combination of the two can effectively reduce the energy consumption of base stations. In this study, by monitoring the network load, user behavior and the status of base station equipment in real time, the working mode and resource allocation of base station are dynamically adjusted, and an energy-saving optimization scheme is proposed. The simulation results show that the scheme can save energy by 33.2 % in the whole day, which is significantly better than the traditional fixed shutdown strategy, on the premise of ensuring that the quality of service (QoS) decline does not exceed 2 %. The access success rate is 99.3 %, the average delay is 28.7 milliseconds, and the traffic satisfaction rate is 98.1 %. Compared with the traditional strategy, it has a significant improvement while ensuring high QoS. This strategy not only improves the utilization efficiency of base station resources, but also responds to the environmental protection concept of energy saving and emission reduction, and provides an effective way for energy saving optimization of roaming base stations in different networks."

The system is based on an Arduino board and an Ultrasonic sensor equipped with a Wi-Fi modem to communicate with the user’s phone which can start the measurement and monitor the water depth through a website. The result showed that in the laboratory test, the alert was successfully sent to the user’s phone whenever the water depth was past the threshold value. In the field test, the measurement of the lake’s water depth was effectively monitored via the website using a 6000 mAh battery that lasted for 72 times data transmission for 12 hours.

However, Indonesia currently lacks domain-specific FHIR Implementation Guides (IG), limiting consistent data modeling, validation, and exchange across health systems. This study uses an Action Design Research (ADR) approach to develop a FHIR IG for antenatal care (ANC) services in Sampang, East Java, guided by the WHO SMART Guidelines. The development process involved defining scope and requirements, modeling FHIR profiles, and validating the IG using standard tools. Supporting workflows and architecture were documented using UML and ArchiMate 3.2. The IG was authored in FHIR Shorthand (FSH), starting with the conversion of the SATUSEHAT Core IG from Forge using GoFSH. Validation included unit testing with SUSHI and Firely Terminal, and system testing with HAPI FHIR to ensure interoperability for the antenatal care dataset. The IG focuses on Logical Models, Value Sets, Code Systems, and Profiles. Findings emphasize the urgent need for reusable, standards-aligned components and strong stakeholder engagement to support interoperable, scalable digital health systems in Indonesia."

The results showed supplying hydrogen through gas pipelines at a pressure exceeding the gas turbine requirements (Case 2) as the most advantageous approach in terms of stability of supply, economic effectiveness (long-term use), convenience of administrative control, and space occupancy. Although this method has the drawback of high initial investment costs, it demonstrates the potential to offset these through long-term operational efficiency and reliability. Furthermore, for the successful implementation of Case 2, additional measures such as technical standard, comprehensive safety, and public acceptance are required. Adopting this approach is expected to enable the establishment of a stable and sustainable hydrogen energy supply chain."

ZKPU is designed to flexibly support a wide range of ZK workloads; in this work, we demonstrate its capabilities by implementing and optimizing multi-scalar multiplication (MSM), a core bottleneck in many zk-SNARK systems. Built using the Chipyard framework and equipped with dedicated modular arithmetic units, ZKPU achieves significant performance and energy efficiency improvements over CPU, GPU, and FPGA baselines. Our results highlight ZKPU as a practical and forward-compatible foundation for scalable ZK acceleration in modern decentralized systems."

Subsequently, the correlations between the features, especially the positive correlations between resource availability and different variables in the system, were assessed by Grey Correlation Analysis (GRA). Finally, the paper applies the Lotka-Volterra model to simulate the interactions between the variables in the system and assesses the impact of different variables on the overall system stability during the system evolution by means of the damage function.

Among these, Topic (1) demonstrated the highest coherence and exclusivity, highlighting strong public concern over the role of government and institutional actors in environmental sustainability. The results suggest that audiences are not only aware of greenwashing tactics but also critically engage with the legitimacy of corporate and government environmental claims.

This study compares different machine learning models to detect fake job postings using the EMSCAD dataset. We tested modern transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, ELECTRA) against traditional methods (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression). A key finding of our research was discovering data leakage problems when adding external fake job data to improve our dataset. When we first tried to balance our dataset by adding synthetic fake job data, it created false patterns that made our models learn wrong things, especially linking \"internship\" with fake jobs when this wasn't actually true. After finding and fixing these data problems, BERT-base-uncased performed the best with 98.88% accuracy, 0.8802 F1-score for detecting fake jobs, and 0.9909 ROC AUC score. XGBoost with TF-IDF features also showed strong results among traditional models. This work shows why careful data checking is important in machine learning projects and provides reliable models for detecting fake job postings online."

Accurately identifying the non-frontal facial position represents this issue when a machine interacts dynamically with a human. On the other hand, the implementation in real applications encourages a vision method to be able to operate on cheap devices. An efficient and high-performance Convolutional Neural Network model is proposed to recognize multi-pose facial emotions. A light inception and channel wave approach generates an efficient and lightweight structure. In order to boost the accuracy of the model prediction, it implements a combined attentive module that avoids excessive parameters. This module captures useful facial elements by generating the feature representation along the channel vector and the spatial dimension of the input map. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves competitive accuracy compared to CNN architecture and other works. The model demonstrates real-time performance on edge computing devices, achieving 27 frames per second on a Jetson Nano, including integrated face detection. This performance was validated under real-world multi-view conditions, where facial orientations are not aligned with the camera."

Conventional monitoring techniques tend to be reactive, require a lot of labor, and are frequently inaccessible to smallscale farmers. This study introduces an affordable, autonomous drone-based system for immediate detection of wheat diseases utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The drone autonomously hovers over wheat fields following a set flight route, taking pictures at consistent intervals for analysis. The Raspberry Pi processes these images locally, using the CNN model to classify each one as either healthy or diseased, and also detect specific diseases such as brown rust, black rust, aphids, and more. A LiPo battery powers the Raspberry Pi system, enabling it to function in the field without requiring an external power source. Experimental outcomes from the test dataset show a classification accuracy of 94 %, and findings from wheat field trials further illustrate its effectiveness in practice. This method provides an affordable, scalable, and sustainable way to detect diseases early, potentially decreasing pesticide usage, preventing crop loss, and enhancing yield results in farming."

By processing video frames and extracting 3D keypoints, we provide visualizations that offer coaches and players an intuitive method to analyze technique, optimize performance, and prevent injury. Our approach successfully detects and visualizes the 3D poses of badminton players, providing valuable insights into their dynamic movements. Our findings demonstrate the potential of 3D pose detection visualization to revolutionize training techniques in badminton and provide a foundation for similar applications in other sports."

    "abstract": "Accurate UE positioning is critical for emerging applications such as autonomous robotics and industrial automation. Recognizing its importance, the 3GPP standard has incorporated wireless-signal-based positioning methods since Release 11. While CSI fingerprinting enables fine-grained spatial awareness, it remains highly sensitive to environmental changes, and closet prior work like DEGN-LIC, though aiming to enhance robustness, struggle to generalize across domains and capture spatial semantics effectively. To address this, we propose RT-AUGGAN, a data augmentation framework that generates consistent CSI fingerprints under changing environments. Rather than reconstructing explicit spatial representations, our approach directly injects spatial semantics through positional encoding and guides the generation process via a location-aware encoder. Using NVIDIA Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that RT-AUGGAN significantly improves positioning accuracy, achieving up to 32% gain at a 3.0m error threshold over the original library—outperforming existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of targeted CSI augmentation for robust indoor positioning in dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Object detection is a computer vision problem related to the localization of an object in an image. Most of the algorithms used today are based on deep learning techniques, which reach state-of-the-art results but still cannot explain why the model makes that particular decision. Explainable Artificial Intelligence emerges to address this issue, with many works seeking visual explanations (saliency maps) of the internal workings of the model. In this work, we propose a new attribution method for generating saliency maps named D-IBA (Detector Information Bottleneck for Attribution) as an alternative to the state-of-the-art D-RISE. We evaluated our technique with the pre-trained Faster R-CNN, RetinaNET, and YOLOv11n models on subsets of the MS COCO 2017 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets showing that D-IBA achieves similar results compared to D-RISE but with a lower computational cost (more than 50 times faster). We also evaluate how the method supports the interpretation of misclassified detections and how it can perform contrastive explanations, and propose a new evaluation metric that efficiently assesses the quality of a saliency map by performing only two forward passes through the network."

Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning, remarkable progress has been made over the past decade. However, a comprehensive review and analysis of this task remains absent. In this paper, we present the first extensive survey of semantic correspondence methods. We first propose a taxonomy to classify existing methods based on the type of their method designs. These methods are then categorized accordingly, and we provide a detailed analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we aggregate and summarize the results of methods in the literature across various benchmarks into a unified comparative table, with detailed configurations to highlight performance variations. Additionally, to provide a detailed understanding of existing methods for semantic matching, we thoroughly conduct controlled experiments to analyze the effectiveness of the components of different methods. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing a solid foundation for future research in this field. We hope this survey serves as a comprehensive reference and consolidated baseline for future development.

    "abstract": "In practical applications, the achievement of long-distance, large-array-scale, relay-free sensing is associated with the accommodating loss of the system. The most effective way to improve it is to increase the maximum optical power entering the transmission fiber. However, this will inevitably lead to more significant fiber nonlinear effects, resulting in deterioration of the system noise performance. In comparison to the narrow- linewidth laser, the white-light suffers less from fiber nonlinear effects, and thus has a higher maximum fiber-input power. Here we present an interferometric fiber-optic hydrophone system that employs a white-light source. We develop a concise theoretical model of this scheme and elucidate the limitations of the light source factors on the minimum phase noise of the system. The experimental results show that the maximum fiber-input power of our scheme is enhanced by 11 dB to 20 dBm, and the maximum link accommodating loss is augmented by 12 dB to 70 dB in comparison to the scheme that employs a narrow- linewidth laser. A phase noise of -95.08 dB ref 1 rad/√ Hz near 1kHz is obtained at the accommodating loss of 70dB. The proposed scheme can provide effective support for low-noise underwater detection applications in long-distance, relay-free scenarios."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as transformative enablers in next-generation wireless communication systems due to their mobility, flexibility and rapid deployment capabilities. The integration of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) further enhances their potential by enabling intelligent signal propagation control, improving coverage and reducing active transmission power. However, energy efficiency (EE) remains a major bottleneck in sustaining prolonged UAV operations, especially in dense, latency-sensitive and high-demand communication environments. While EE is studied independently with respect to UAV and IRS, integration-level EE, jointly considering UAV flight dynamics, IRS control and communication design, remains underexplored. Existing surveys largely focus on architectural or algorithmic aspects of either UAV or IRS systems with only limited or domain-specific treatment of EE. Motivated by these gaps, this paper presents first survey that consolidates and extends the EE perspective in IRS-assisted UAV communications. We focus on key-domains such as trajectory optimization, power control, cooperative deployment and secure transmission, examine a wide range of IRS deployment strategies, including ground-based, UAV-mounted and hybrid IRS systems and explore how they dynamically enhance link reliability, spectral efficiency and energy savings under various operational scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate cutting-edge optimization algorithms, including convex programming, deep reinforcement learning and semantic-aware control frameworks, which jointly manage UAV mobility, IRS beamforming and computational offloading to reduce energy consumption. Channel modeling advances are also discussed, highlighting the transition from traditional line-of-sight models to complex, stochastic and near-field models tailored for IRS-UAV integration. By synthesizing findings from recent studies, this article underscores the transformative potential of IRS in addressing the energy limitations of UAVs. The insights presented can serve as a reference for researchers and system designers aiming to deploy sustainable, scalable, intelligent and energy-efficient IRS-assisted UAV communication networks aligned with future sixth generation (6G) standards for wireless communications."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models that predict the future behavior of real-world systems and processes (also known as predictive AI models) are central to intelligent decision-making. They are often employed in model-based decision-making frameworks to optimize decisions for real-world tasks based on their predictions. However, decisions optimized using such predictive AI models often result in suboptimal performance when applied in the real world. This is primarily because these models are typically constructed to best fit the behavior of the real-world system, and hence to predict the most likely future rather than to optimize the best possible decisions for a given task. Due to this objective mismatch, their predictions cannot be guaranteed to support optimal decision-making in theory or in practice. In fact, there is increasing empirical evidence and consensus that predictive models must be tailored to decision-making objectives to achieve optimal real-world performance. Supporting this observation, we establish formal (necessary and sufficient) conditions that a predictive model (AI-based or not) must satisfy for a decision-making policy derived using that model to achieve optimal performance in the real world. We then discuss their implications for building predictive AI models for optimal sequential decision-making."

    "abstract": "Solidity smart contracts are widely used to implement decentralized applications. However, their development remains challenging due to the language’s domain-specific complexity, the immutability of deployed contracts, which prevents post-deployment fixes, and the high risk of introducing security-critical vulnerabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation across general domains, they often struggle to meet the structural and security-specific demands of smart contract development. Therefore, this paper presents a domain-adapted code completion model trained on 22,000 labeled code constructs extracted from Solidity contracts. The model is built on a transformer-based architecture and fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), a parameter-efficient method. The dataset is processed to highlight secure coding patterns and structural semantics, enabling the model to learn from both preceding and succeeding contexts. Evaluation using perplexity, the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, and the Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR) shows significant improvements with consistent gains across all three metrics compared to the base model. These results demonstrate that targeted adaptation of language models can significantly enhance coding support in Solidity smart contracts."

However, by adjusting the weight coefficient of negative sequence current, it is impossible to achieve simultaneous suppression of current imbalance and power double-frequency pulsation. Therefore, this paper takes the optical storage grid-connected system as the research object, and proposes an improved VSG control strategy that does not rely on positive and negative sequence current dual control channels. The negative sequence voltage compensation link considering the negative sequence current is added to the current inner loop of the conventional VSG control to improve the current imbalance, and the power double frequency component in the negative sequence voltage compensation link is controlled based on the Q-PR controller. The effectiveness and correctness of the proposed VSG improved control strategy are verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulation software."

Insights gathered from these reviews are a part of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and long textual reviews can overwhelm users. This research proposes a new AI-powered keywords extraction and sentiment profiling to help food delivery platforms gain better customer insight. By utilizing the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, this study applies natural language processing to automatically extract keywords and classify sentiments from Indonesian food delivery reviews. The AI model was trained and evaluated using a real-world dataset based in Indonesia. The AI model is designed following a modular T5 Natural Language Processing framework, which is extended with sentiment classification capabilities. The AI model was able to generate top keywords that describe insights of the entire review per merchant. Evaluation procedures were done through precision, recall, F1-score, processing time comparison, and human relevance scoring. Experimental results show that the T5 model achieves high accuracy and processes reviews significantly faster than manual methods—up to 37 times quicker. The AI system outputs structured summaries per merchant, enabling more efficient insight generation for CRM."

    "abstract": "Phase-Change Memory (PCM) is a promising non-volatile memory technology, but its endurance is limited by wear-out mechanisms that degrade memory blocks over time. Proactive identification of block health status is critical for implementing effective wear-leveling and fault-prevention strategies. This paper proposes a lightweight, interpretable machine learning approach to classify PCM blocks. First, we developed a synthetic dataset simulating <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5, 0 0 0}$</tex> memory blocks with three health categories (Healthy, Degraded, Near-Failure) and features such as write count, operating temperature, and error frequency. Three models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes) were trained and evaluated. The Decision Tree achieved 99.9 % cross-validation accuracy, outperforming Logistic Regression (81.2%) and Naive Bayes <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(75.3 \\%)$</tex>. Feature importance analysis highlighted write count and temperature as dominant indicators of degradation. To validate on real data, we further analyzed a hardware trace dataset containing binary health labels (Healthy, Near-Failure). Here, Decision Tree and Random Forest achieved near-perfect accuracy due to highly separable write-based thresholds, confirming the robustness of simple interpretable models. Together, these results demonstrate that interpretable, rule-based approaches can effectively classify PCM health across both simulated and real datasets, providing a practical foundation for advanced memory management systems."

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterised by seizures caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Today, the diagnosis of epilepsy is largely based on the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the nonlinear and chaotic nature of EEG signals makes visual inspection a time-consuming, labour-intensive, and specialised process. In this context, this study proposes a computer-aided diagnostic method that aims to analyse EEG signals more efficiently. Within the scope of the study, power values belonging to different frequency bands were obtained from EEG signals collected from 121 participants through 35 electrodes. In determining the electrode combinations, the individual classification performance of each electrode was analysed, the electrode with the highest performance was selected and combined with the other electrodes in the vector space, thus creating effective electrode combinations. The resulting feature vectors were presented as input to the decision tree classifier, and the model’s performance was evaluated with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. Using a combination of theta band power features obtained from F3C3, C3P3, T6O2, T5O1, FP2A2, O2A2 and P4A2 electrodes, the model showed a high success in epilepsy detection with 84.6% accuracy and 81.1% F1 score."

    "abstract": "Recent developments in sentiment analysis underline the necessity for models that mix deep learning with domain-specific expertise, especially for languages with few resources like Indonesian. By suggesting a hybrid architecture combining BERT with structured sentiment knowledge graphs, this work tackles the problem of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in e-commerce reviews. The model uniquely addresses two important drawbacks: (1) the difficulty of pure data-driven techniques to use current sentiment lexicons and (2) the semantic distortion brought on by naive knowledge injection strategies. We propose three technical contributions: (1) a dynamic knowledge selection mechanism that retrieves relevant sentiment triples from the structured knowledge graph (SKG); (2) a sentence encoder with soft-position embeddings that retains sentence semantics; and (3) a masked self-attention mechanism to prevent information leakage from irrelevant nodes. With specific increases in recognizing implicit characteristics (+23% F1-score), the suggested design reaches 94.3% accuracy instead of 88.7% for traditional IndoBERT. Unlike conventional approaches, the model preserves interpretability using explicit aspect-sentiment mappings apparent in the attention weights. This work offers a useful model for improving ABSA systems in resource-constrained settings without calling for more labeled data."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a decentralized authorization framework that employs non-transferable Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), also known as soul-bound tokens (SBTs), to deliver tamper-resistant, identity-bound access control. Access rights are permanently linked to a user's blockchain wallet and can be upgraded via metadata updates without reminting, enabling dynamic tier management while preventing resale or delegation. The architecture combines an ERC-721 smart contract backend with a decentralized front-end interface for wallet-based authentication and administrator-controlled content distribution. Implementation on the Binance Smart Chain test network demonstrates secure and cost-effective access management with tiered content control. An experimental evaluation quantifies the gas costs associated with NFT minting, tier upgrades, and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) metadata storage. Results show that using the native Base32 encoding of IPFS content identifiers reduces storage gas costs by approximately 6% compared to the previously standard Bitcoin-style Base58 encoding. Furthermore, shorter uniform resource identifiers (URIs) avoid costly expansions of the storage slots of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can increase transaction costs by 20,000 gas per slot. These findings provide practical guidelines for designing scalable and cost-effective NFT-based authorization systems. Source code and implementation details are available on GitHub."

    "abstract": "Shape-from-Focus (SFF) estimates scene depth from a focal stack, i.e., a sequence of images captured at varying focus settings. However, most existing deep learning approaches to SFF overlook the importance of explicitly constraining the focus volume during training, which often results in suboptimal depth maps. Moreover, these methods typically regress depth directly from the focus volume without applying any dedicated refinement, thereby limiting the quality of the final prediction. To address these issues, we propose a modular framework consisting of three key components: an Encoder–Decoder Module (ED), a Depth Extraction Module (DEM), and a Depth Improvement Module (DIM). The ED module computes a focus volume that represents per-pixel focus responses; the DEM then extracts an initial depth map from this focus volume, and the DIM refines it to produce the final depth map. Crucially, during training, the learned focus volume is constrained by a traditional focus measure–based focus volume using a weighted least squares optimization, thereby directly injecting classical focus cues into the learning process alongside the depth loss against ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate and reliable depth maps."

    "abstract": "In this paper, the real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis technology of virtual power plant (VPP) is deeply discussed to solve the challenges of safe, stable and efficient operation brought by its scale expansion and system complexity. Real-time monitoring provides decision-making basis for operators through data acquisition, transmission, processing and visualization, optimizes energy distribution and scheduling, and improves energy utilization efficiency. Fault diagnosis technology can quickly identify fault types, locate fault locations and take repair measures to reduce downtime and maintenance costs. In this paper, a three-tier architecture design of “edge layer-platform layer-application layer” is proposed, which covers core functional modules such as data acquisition, state awareness and anomaly warning. Multisource data fusion technology optimizes data processing, dynamic state evaluation model quantifies operation state through equipment health index, and data-driven fault diagnosis technology adopts mixed diagnosis method, which combines mechanism model, migration learning and knowledge map reasoning to meet the diagnosis needs of different types of faults. The verification case shows that the consumption rate of renewable energy is increased from 85% to 93 %, the average fault location time is shortened from 45 minutes to 8 minutes, the false alarm rate is reduced from 12.5 % to 3.2 %, and the annual operating income is increased from 12 million yuan to 14.3 million yuan, which significantly improves the reliability and economic benefits of the system and promotes the digital transformation of the power industry."

    "abstract": "As Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchains, it is naturally targeted by various attacks, aiming, for example, to disrupt the service or steal tokens. Among these, in deanonymization attacks, an adversary can obtain validator IP addresses and then perform a Denial-of-Service attack on them. To mitigate this attack, the Ethereum foundation is proposing Whisk, a Single Secret Leader Election protocol that uses a zero-knowledge proof called Curdleproofs to prove the validity of a shuffle of validators. One limitation of Curdleproofs is the shuffle size, which must be a power of two, restricting the number of validators that can be included. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing CAAUrdleproofs, a modified version of Curdleproofs that incorporates Springproofs. Our experiments show that CAAUrdleproofs offers a performance advantage for any shuffle size that is not a power of two and that this advantage increases as the shuffle size decreases below a power of two."

Due to the complexity of the system structure, the heterogeneity of multi-source data, and the dynamics of the operating environment, anomaly detection and fault diagnosis face great challenges. This paper focuses on the anomaly detection and diagnosis technology in virtual power plant monitoring system, systematically combs through the current commonly used rule models and data-driven methods, discusses the construction idea of multi-source information fusion and intelligent diagnosis framework, and analyzes the adaptability and limitations of the technology in combination with typical application scenarios. It looks forward to the future development trend of virtual power plant in the direction of edge intelligence, adaptive diagnosis and privacy protection, which provides theoretical support and technical reference for the construction of a more secure, reliable and intelligent virtual power plant monitoring system."

Yet the traditional methods are time-consuming and prone to error. In this study, we compare three popular CNN—MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet152—using transfer learning on a publicly available dataset of mushroom images organized into edible and poisonous classes. All images are resized to 224x224 pixels and augmented with rotations, flips, shifts, and zooms to enhance model robustness. We train each model with custom hyperparameters and evaluate on unseen test sets using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. MobileNetV2 achieves the highest test accuracy (93.6%) outperforming ResNet152 (86.2%) and VGG19 (83.3%), while also offering lower computational cost. Confusion matrix analysis reveals that lightweight architectures can generalize better on limited data. Our findings provide clear guidance for selecting efficient deep learning models in rapid, reliable mushroom classification applications."

Based on the law of conservation of mass, the state equation of water level change in the lock chamber is derived, and the output equation considering the constraints such as channel water depth and safe distance between ships is established. The optimization goal focuses on improving the efficiency of port transportation system, including ship waiting time optimization, lock congestion optimization, and enhancing the safety of lock scheduling. In the application and optimization of intelligent control algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen as the optimization algorithm. GA iteratively optimizes the parameters of lock water level regulation by simulating the selection, crossover and mutation operations in the process of biological evolution. The experiment adopts the joint simulation platform of SHIPFLOW and MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the physical characteristics and interaction of lock, ship and water flow. The experimental results show that the average waiting time of the ship is shortened from 3.5 hours to 1.2 hours, the congestion index of the lock is reduced from 0.6 to 0.2, and the probability that the water level in the lock chamber exceeds the safe range is reduced from 15 % to 2 %. These results prove that the intelligent control algorithm based on GA is effective in improving the efficiency and safety of the lock water level regulation system, which provides strong support for the intelligent upgrade of the port transportation system."

    "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is an environmentally friendly technology that has a pivotal role in the augmentation of power output with cutting emissions. PEMFC contains various elements such as a membrane, bipolar plates with flow channels, gas diffusion and catalyst layers. The gas channel dimensions remarkably affect the performance features of PEMFC. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) model is constructed using ANSYS Fluent PEMFC Module and SOLIDWORKS. The novel channel configurations are created to decrease pressure drop of the small cross-sectional size of channel (A = 0.04 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) for 0.4 and 0.6 V. The findings reveal that an increase in channel cross-section dimensions results in substantially diminishing pressure loss. The anode and cathode pressure drops of 27.2 kPa and 90.9 kPa are recorded for the new configuration with the section size of 4A compared to small size channel with those of 156.6 kPa and 451.6 kPa, respectively, at 0.4 V. This configuration only decreases the current density of 24% compared to the small size channel at the same voltage. Despite various studies on flow losses of PEMFC, an effective way to reduce fluid friction in the channel has remained elusive. Innovative configurations can be a good option to decrease pressure loss in the channels with small dimensions."

Recognition accuracy was evaluated with changes in the distance to the subject, variations in the number of cameras, head orientation, pitch angle, and enrollment image rotation. Results demonstrate that dual-camera configurations consistently improved accuracy and effective range compared to a single-camera setup. Reduced subject height led to a larger range of accurate facial recognition.

This model combines the advantages of Gaussian process regression (GPR) in dealing with complex data relations and the ability of harmony search algorithm (HS) in global optimization. The model input includes light intensity, temperature and weather type, and the output is photovoltaic power. By introducing HS algorithm to optimize the superparameter of GPR, the problems of high computational complexity and easy falling into local optimization in traditional optimization methods are overcome. The experimental data comes from the actual monitoring data of a photovoltaic power station for one year, the study explores photovoltaic power generation across different seasons and weather conditions. The experimental results show that the HS-GPR algorithm delivers predictions that are highly consistent with actual values across different weather conditions. Its error metrics—mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{R}^{\\text{2}}$</tex>)—outperform those of traditional GPR algorithms and other widely used photovoltaic power forecasting techniques, such as support vector machines (SVM) and neural networks (NN). Additionally, by optimizing the HS algorithm's parameters and improving the GPR kernel function, the model's predictive accuracy is further enhanced. This study presents a promising method to improve the precision and dependability of photovoltaic power forecasting, which is crucial for the future operation and management of photovoltaic power plants."

There is a need to build a novel method of detection, so that these bad-intent emails do not reach unsuspecting users. This paper will discuss the design and implementation of a novel detection method based on large language models (LLMs) that can take an email and be able to correctly classify the content as phishing or legitimate. The goal is to fine-tune a model to leverage the model's pre-trained content of understanding language and then pass email text with the classification to change weights in the model so it can classify the emails. Both the untuned version and fine-tuned versions will be compared with accuracy and recall, showing the power of fine-tuning and how each model's architecture helps determine the classification. Experimental results show that the proposed system is promising and improves the overall performance compared to other models."

The devices were engineered with standardized aspect ratios (W/L) and exposed to identical bias conditions during the irradiation process. Among the various Radiation-Hardness-By-Design (RHBD) techniques, both layout configurations demonstrate robust resilience to the ionizing radiation from Co-60, with less than 2% for a TID of 2Mrad. Additionally, owing to its symmetrical design, the aspect ratio (W/L) of the Diamond MOSFET is easier to compute and attains lower values than those observed in the ELTs, 2.33 times. Therefore, it can be considered a viable RHBD alternative for implementing more compact and robust IC applications."

However, most current live volumetric video streaming methods struggle to facilitate the real-time performance requirements due to the nature of frequent user interactions and the complexity of network environments during video playback. Inspired by the correlation between the human visual effects and adjacent frame motion features, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Cetus</i>, a context-aware cross-layer coordination system for live volumetric videos. First, we present an application-layer Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based codec framework that leverages spatio-temporal semantic information for optimizing the compression quality of each video frame. Second, we exploit a flexible cross-layer coordination framework that seamlessly integrates frame drop strategy with partially reliable transmission, orchestrating transport protocols and application-informed rates to enhance the Quality of Experience (QoE) for multiple users. Furthermore, we develop a lightweight branching decision tree algorithm that adaptively makes fine-grained frame drop decisions. Experimental evaluations of our implemented system prototype demonstrate that Cetus significantly outperforms existing baseline approaches. Compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, Cetus effectively improves video frame rate by at least 24.7% and video quality by an average of 32.6%."

    "abstract": "To address the degradation of localization accuracy in star trackers under dynamic conditions, this paper proposes a gyro-aided localization method integrating trailing star spot reconstruction with effective point spread function construction. First, motion blur kernels are parameterized using gyroscope’s angular velocity and exposure time, followed by an adaptive iterative Richardson-Lucy algorithm to restore trailing star spots. A residual minimization-based iteration termination criterion is established to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio star spot restoration. Secondly, we estimate the relative displacements of stars across multiple frames using the gyroscope’s angular velocity measurements, and then perform sub-pixel level nonuniform interpolation registration. By integrating the registered star samples, we reconstruct a high signal-to-noise ratio effective Point Spread Function model. Finally, sub-pixel localization is implemented using the refined effective point spread function. Validated by numerical simulations, laboratory experiments, and real night sky observations, the proposed method reduces localization error by approximately 23% compared to the traditional gyro-free effective Point Spread Function construction method (0.122 pixel) under 3°/s dynamic conditions, achieving a localization accuracy of 0.094 pixel. This demonstrates that by parameterizing the blur kernel with gyroscope information and constraining sub-pixel displacements, the present approach eliminates both kernel-estimation and registration errors inherent in conventional methods, thereby providing theoretical and practical support for approaching the static precision limit in dynamic situation."

    "abstract": "In high power density applications, oil-cooled motors have become a research focus due to their superior thermal performance. Fast thermal analysis methods are crucial for optimizing design of motor. In this study, a three-dimensional lumped parameter thermal network is developed to capture the unique heat transfer paths of oil-cooled motors. Simultaneously, a comprehensive loss model is constructed by considering temperature-dependent losses, including hysteresis and eddy current effects. By coupling the thermal and loss models, a fast electro-thermal co-simulation method is proposed. To address the spatial variation in oil temperature, an oil temperature estimation model is developed, which improves the accuracy of thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, to resolve the issue of circumferential non-uniform cooling, the distribution of oil flow along the circumferential direction is experimentally characterized. Based on this, and in conjunction with classical Reynolds number correlations, a circumferentially varying convective heat transfer coefficient model is established. Finally, experimental results validate the temperature prediction accuracy of the proposed thermal model. In a 2000-second temperature estimation process, the maximum temperature deviation was –5.8 °C, and the maximum root-mean-square error was 3.2 °C."

    "abstract": "Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) in permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives inherently generates high-frequency sideband voltage harmonics (HFSVH) near the carrier switching frequency (CSF) and its integer multiples. These harmonics can cause high-frequency vibrations and electromagnetic interference (EMI). This paper presents a double Beta overlapped random switching period SVPWM (DBORSP-SVPWM) strategy to suppress HFSVH and enable flexible harmonic peak control. An analytical model for the output voltage power spectral density (PSD) of random switching period SVPWM (RSP-SVPWM) in a two-level inverter-based PMSM drive is derived, revealing the influence of the CSF probability density function (PDF) on harmonic distribution. To overcome the limited tunability of uniform-distribution RSP-SVPWM, a multi-peak CSF distribution is designed to redistribute HFSVH energy and regulate peak levels, improving adaptability to complex frequency environments. An overlap factor is further introduced to adjust the CSF PDF, enhancing spectral broadening and uniformity while mitigating harmonic concentration and resonance risks. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DBORSP-SVPWM effectively suppresses HFSVH and achieves controllable harmonic peaks, providing practical guidance for random PWM applications in high-performance electric drives."

    "abstract": "With the widespread development of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) systems, flocking motion has become a common but essential application in UAV swarms. However, most existing approaches are rule-based and only valid for specific scenarios, which are limited in adaptability and scalability. In this paper, we present a novel framework termed attention-biased deep deterministic policy gradient (ABDDPG), which combines the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm and attention-biased Transformer (ABTransformer). First, we encode the comprehensive environmental features observed by each UAV as input. Then, we introduce ABTransformer into the actor-critic network architecture. This allows the model to fully utilize each drone’s positional relationship with surrounding objects (including obstacles and other drones), endowing it with the ability to allocate attention reasonably. Furthermore, we utilize LoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning to further improve performance and training efficiency. This attention-biased reinforcement learning model enables each UAV in the swarm to learn and allocate local attention autonomously, guaranteeing internal communication stability and flocking motion task completion. The experimental results demonstrate that ABDDPG outperforms previous methods in terms of arrival rate, training speed, and inference efficiency, and is robust to different scenarios."

A driven dynamical system creates such pairs, and a function can be learned on them that can reconstruct the underlying dynamics as in Takens delay embedding. The approach assures embedding stability unlike Takens delay embedding, and learnability, which can be absent, while stability can be present in the current reservoir computing framework. This accurately models underlying systems where recent methods like the next-generation reservoir computing fail. We demonstrate results and compare with the other methods, including SINDY-PI."

    "abstract": "The Moon can be used as a stable calibration target for on-orbit satellite instruments without the need for solar diffusers or atmospheric correction. Radiometric models of the Moon have been developed to enable lunar calibration; however, to the authors’ knowledge, a polarization model of the Moon to improve lunar calibration of polarization-sensitive instruments has not been published. In this work, models of the disk-averaged degree of linear polarization in terms of lunar geometry variables were developed for nine spectral bands (336 nm, 365 nm, 383 nm, 450 nm, 519 nm, 650 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, and a broadband channel with a response from 400 nm to 1000 nm) using measurements from three previously published datasets. The set of models was named the Lunar disk-Averaged Model of Polarization (LAMP). LAMP includes two types of models: a model dependent on phase angle and Sun selenographic longitude was used for all nine channels, and a second model incorporating libration variables (observer selenographic latitude and longitude) was used for the three channels with the most observations. The majority of the residuals for the simpler model of degree of linear polarization were within 0.01, and the majority for the model with libration dependence were within 0.005 (for measured DoLP values ranging from -0.016 to 0.204)."

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) represent a novel approach that enables flexible adjustments to antenna positions, effectively altering the channel environment and thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs."

    "abstract": "Advances in phased array radar (PAR) technology have enabled modern radar systems to control beams with extreme agility. In multitarget tracking (MTT) scenarios, efficient allocation of beam resources is essential to maintain optimal tracking performance. High-precision radar systems often employ narrow beams to achieve superior angular accuracy. However, the use of narrow beams increases the chance of target miss-detections, thereby violating conventional tracking assumptions and challenging existing beam scheduling methods. To address the narrow-beam effect, a filter-based beam steering approach is proposed, which leverages the information of missed detections to facilitate rapid target localization. The expected posterior entropy reduction (EPER) associated with the narrow-beam steering is derived and an approximation method is proposed to enable its application in beam scheduling. Furthermore, an optimization framework and a corresponding solution technique are proposed for joint beamwidth selection and narrow-beam scheduling for MTT. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheduler."

    "abstract": "Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under extreme stress. In realworld fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multiagent coordination framework in which autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents-a high-level rescuer (HLR) and a lowlevel rescuer (LLR)-coordinate through shared observations and complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for humans and adapt in realtime. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees, significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to scenarios without UAV assistance. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>We provide access to more details for results and the simulation at https://solid.eecs.berkeley.edu/humanitarian-response/UAV coordination, Partial Observability, Disaster Relief"

    "abstract": "The cattle industry in Indonesia is super important, but it’s not always easy to match supply with demand, especially during big events like Eid al-Adha. This study tries to tackle that by combining conjoint analysis to figure out what buyers want with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict seasonal demand for cattle at Prabufarm, a modern farm in Pasuruan, East Java. We found that buyers really care about cattle breed (22.45% importance) and health (18.09%), with Simental cattle (utility: +0.051) and healthy ones (utility: +0.250) being the top picks. Using simulated sales data from 2018-2024, our LSTM model predicted a demand of 150 Simental cattle (600-700 kg, healthy) for Eid al-Adha 2025, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of just 0.02. We propose a digital systema dashboard and e-commerce platformto use these insights to boost sales and profits for farmers. This AI-driven approach could help Prabufarm stand out in the competitive livestock market and support digital transformation in the livestock business."

    "abstract": "The complexity of marine electrical system and the variability of operating environment lead to frequent system failures. Traditional fault diagnosis methods rely on expert experience and cannot meet the needs of complex systems. With its powerful feature extraction ability, deep learning provides a new idea for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is proposed. By collecting and preprocessing multi-dimensional sensor time series data, the fault features are extracted and classified by using 1D-CNN architecture. The experimental results show that the accuracy of this method in the multi-classification task of ship electrical system faults reaches 96.8%, which is significantly better than the traditional method, and the calculation efficiency is suitable for real-time reasoning of edge equipment. In the aspect of adaptive control, an algorithm based on model reference adaptive control (MRAC) is designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional fixed parameter control methods for ship electrical system affected by load changes and environmental factors. The algorithm estimates the system parameters online by recursive least squares (RLS), and combines with robust control law to achieve effective control of the system. The simulation results show that the adaptive control algorithm is superior to the traditional PI controller in step response tracking, load mutation suppression and parameter perturbation adaptability, which significantly improves the stability and adaptability of the system. The scheme of combining fault diagnosis and adaptive control algorithm based on deep learning proposed in this paper provides effective technical support for the safe and reliable operation of ship electrical system, which has important theoretical significance and practical application value."

Traditional centralized systems, however, face significant challenges such as single points of failure, vulnerability to hacking, and data tampering. In this paper, we propose a decentralized framework that leverages Ethereumbased smart contracts to enable secure and autonomous automated trading systems for smart cities. Our approach replaces centralized intermediaries with self-executing contracts, which not only guarantee immutable transaction records and real-time execution but also support dynamic pricing mechanisms that balance supply and demand in real time. We demonstrate our framework through two key use cases-smart healthcare and smart building monitoring-illustrating how smart contracts can automate multi-step workflows while preventing issues such as double spending through robust cryptographic measures. Experimental results obtained from a testbed implementation (utilizing Node.js, web3.js, and Ethereum Virtual Machines on Raspberry Pis) highlight the system's fault tolerance, improved transaction speeds, and scalability. Additionally, simulations reveal that as transaction values increase, the risk of double spending can be mitigated by adjusting the hashing power, ensuring a secure and reliable environment for automated trading. This work contributes to the state of the art in blockchain-based automation by providing a viable, cost-effective alternative to traditional, centralized control systems in smart city applications."

AIG facilitates and accelerates the development process for items such as distractors, known as automatic distractor generation (ADG) in MCQs. Large Language Models (LLMs), like Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), have greatly improved AIG's capacity to produce high-quality questions in a variety of areas, including MCQs for vocabulary tests, as artificial intelligence has advanced at a rapid pace. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. These include deep contextual understanding, the generation of irrelevant distractors, and inherent textual biases. and exhibit syntagmatic relationships with the broader. These issues are particularly prominent in generating distractors that are contextually relevant to the reading passage context of the text. To address these challenges, this study adopts LLMs. It employs a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) prompting technique to generate distractors that maintain syntagmatic relations with the broader reading context. Compared to previous studies, this approach has shown improvement with its accuracy reaching 86.67% in the quality of distraction. Furthermore, implementing the OpenAI GPT-4.0 model demonstrates a substantial increase in the accuracy of distractors in capturing the broader contextual meaning of reading passages. By integrating the prompting RAG with GPT-4.0, this research can contribute to the field of AI and its implementation in education for the purpose of automatic distractors in assessment questions, such as vocabulary questions for reading passages, and specifically in generating vocabulary distractors that make sense contextually."

Experimental results demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms mainstream solutions. It achieves a peak throughput of 14,000 TPS, with failure recovery time and transaction latency being only 38% and 32% of Cosmos, and 76% and 58% of CrossLink, respectively. Moreover, it requires only 1.6 mainchain calls per transaction on average, effectively enhancing system efficiency, fault tolerance, and scalability."

    "abstract": "Global responsibility in engineering involves critical reflection on the role of technology in society, acknowledging the social, political, and economic impact of engineering decisions. Effective humanitarian engineering endeavors require engineers who understand these considerations. While more universities offer curricular and extra-curricular experiences aimed at improving students' sense of global responsibility, there remains a gap in research assessing the effectiveness of these experiences. This study examines one such initiative: a Design Summit hosted by Engineers Without Borders (EWB)-Australia, a four-week immersive design experience for undergraduate students from Australia and New Zealand. Using phenomenological and ethnographic methods, we will explore how students' perspectives on global responsibility evolve throughout the summit. Data collection includes pre- and post-program semi-structured interviews and ethnographic observations during the summit.

    "abstract": "In cognitive radio (CR) applications aiming to optimize spectrum usage dynamically and efficiently, spectrum sensing (SS) procedure plays a crucial role. This paper evaluates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the SS framework for CR networks (CRNs) by reviewing 25 publications in the period of 2019 to 2025, based on the employed learning approach and the supporting features used to detect frequency spectrum occupancy. These AI approaches are categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning, with supervised learning based methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) being the most commonly used. The results of the analysis show a growing trend in the application of deep learning (DL) techniques that show superior capabilities in automatically extracting complex features compared to machine learning (ML) methods. Those using a combination of DL and ML methods also provide good performance. Some features that are often used to detect frequency spectrum occupancy are power spectral density, short-time Fourier transform, and classical energy detection. The paper highlights several important challenges, including the limited availability of labeled data, high computational demands, and limited model generalization capabilities. However, the paper also identifies several possibilities for future research, such as the adoption of federated learning and transfer learning, as well as the integration with emerging technologies such as the use of 6G networks and edge intelligence. The results of this paper are expected to be a valuable reference for the development of more intelligent and responsive SS systems in the future."

    "abstract": "Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in largescale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) integrated with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning framework for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach dynamically learns link priorities based on real-time traffic demand, network topology, remaining transmission opportunities, and interference patterns. The GCN captures spatial dependencies, while the DQN enables adaptive scheduling decisions through reward-guided exploration. Simulation results show that our GCN-DQN model achieves mean SINR improvements of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 7 9. 6 \\%, ~} \\mathbf{1 9 7. 4 \\%}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 7 5. 2 \\%}$</tex> over LDP across three network configurations comprising 83, 163, and 324 wireless links, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the Zero Trust Hypervisor Architecture (ZTHA) to simultaneously achieve security and real-time performance in the High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment of Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV). ZTHA applies the principle of separating the Control Plane and the Data Plane at the hypervisor level. All new communication sessions are strictly verified by a Gateway VM (the Control Plane) against multi-layered security policies, including VM identity and service access rights. Once a session is verified, its subsequent data packets are transmitted with low latency at near hardware line-rate speeds through a Fast Path established in Open vSwitch (OVS). This \"verify first, then accelerate\" approach pragmatically implements the principle of Zero Trust while minimizing performance degradation for real-time communications. Experimental results from a prototype demonstrate that ZTHA significantly improves Round-Trip Time (RTT), throughput, and jitter compared to conventional methods, and shows resilience by maintaining the stability of critical systems under attack loads. This study validates that ZTHA is an effective architecture for providing both robust security and deterministic real-time performance in the complex mixed-criticality environments of SDVs."

This study investigates how perceived value, social influence, and perceived behavioral control influence Gen-Z users' intention to adopt alternative ride-hailing services in Jakarta. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework, the study positions perceived behavioral control as a key mediator and examine gender differences through multi-group analysis. Data was collected from 455 Gen-Z respondents using a structured questionnaire and analyzed with PLS-SEM. The findings reveal that perceived value and social influence significantly affect adoption intention both directly and indirectly, with perceived behavioral control serving as a critical mediating mechanism. Additionally, social influence was found to play a stronger role among female users, highlighting gender-specific adoption patterns. These results can help alternative ride-hailing platforms to form strategies to attract more Gen-Z users."

For efficient analysis, XMODEL, a high-speed link simulation tool, is used to achieve runtime reduction compared to conventional simulators, enabling efficient evaluation of very low bit error rates (BER). A complete transmitter–receiver (TRX) architecture is constructed under channel loss conditions, with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based receiver architecture employing a phase interpolator (PI)-based Mueller–Muller clock and data recovery (MMCDR) system. Two phase detector structures are modeled for comparative analysis: sign-sign MMPD (SS-MMPD) and linear MMPD."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a promising technique for real-time 3D scene representation due to its high rendering quality and compact model size. However, despite its advantages, practical deployment in applications—such as VR/AR systems—remains challenging due to limited processing speed. In particular, the tracking stage presents a critical bottleneck, where the computational overhead significantly affects overall system performance.In this work, we analyze the gradient computation process during the tracking stage of 3D Gaussian Splatting backward rasterization and identify that redundant computations arise from Gaussians associated with negligible loss. We propose a simple yet effective approach that focuses only on significant Gaussians that come from pixels exhibiting high loss and a high object-forming opacity value to guide gradient updates during backward rasterization in tracking. By filtering and computing gradients for these significant Gaussians, our method reduces redundant calculations without substantially sacrificing tracking and rendering quality.This selective tracking approach leads to a substantial reduction in computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method reduces average 90% of computation during tracking, without substantially sacrificing overall tracking and rendering performance. These findings highlight an effective optimization path for accelerating 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic systems are generally modeled with a single diode circuit model. However, the single diode circuit model cannot give correct results under dynamic operating conditions due to the capacitance element in the photovoltaic cell and dynamic effects such as connection cables that may cause inductive effects. In literature, for dynamic operating conditions, single diode models including dynamic effects developed by modeling the system with circuit equations or by modeling the system with circuit elements found in readymade programs such as MATLAB. Models established with circuit equations often fail to integrate successfully with readymade circuit elements, such as resistance, capacitance, and diodes, found in simulation programs like MATLAB. Using only circuit equations in modeling does not allow us to benefit from the functions of a powerful modeling program, such as MATLAB. In this study, both readymade circuit elements and a newly developed photovoltaic cell model are used and simulated together as a whole by solving the circuit equations simultaneously. The parasitic junction and diffusion capacitance elements in the cell were modeled using the variable capacitance element in the MATLAB Simulink environment and simulated with the help of physical solvers. The instantaneous capacitance values of the capacitance element were determined by solving the model equations and given as input to the variable capacitance element. Thus, both the system can be analyzed dynamically with all its aspects using the model equations and ease of use is provided with the available circuit interfaces."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for synthesizing high-fidelity images across diverse domains, yet their application to neuroimaging remains underexplored. We systematically evaluated two representative approaches, namely denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and latent diffusion models (LDM), for generating synthetic brain MRI data using the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset. Both approaches were validated through brain age prediction tasks, with performance assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (R). Models trained on real MRI achieved MAE of 6.26–6.80 years (R = 0.890–0.910), whereas DDPM-generated data degraded performance to MAE of 11.50–13.57 years (R = 0.866–0.871), and LDM-generated data performed worse with MAE of 15.87–18.19 years (R = 0.792–0.827). Both DDPM and LDM exhibited significant limitations in preserving brain morphological structures critical for accurate brain age prediction. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in adapting conventional diffusion models to neuroimaging applications and underscore the need for specialized architectures and training strategies tailored to the unique characteristics of brain MRI data."

The method used is descriptive qualitative with data in the form of 151 online news articles analyzed using the Word Cloud and Crosstab features of NVivo 14. The results show that the tangibles indicator has the highest percentage of 33%, indicating that physical facilities such as infrastructure and supporting devices for the IoT system are the main focus in the flood control system in DKI Jakarta. Meanwhile, the assurance indicator has the lowest percentage of 8%, which indicates that the aspects of trust and assurance of system reliability still need to be improved in its application.

In modern society, the vast road traffic network has penetrated into every corner of social life, and road traffic safety has become a hot topic of social concern. At the same time, the automotive industry has been developing rapidly, and intelligent transportation vehicles are increasingly participating in the vast road transportation network with different roles. Certification, as a qualified assessment activity that conveys trust to society, also plays a crucial role in the new hotspots of social development. However, the focus of road traffic safety certification has always been on end-users such as freight, passenger, schools, and traffic regulatory departments, without including vehicle related organizations in the scope of road traffic safety certification. At the same time, in terms of key legal issues, there are still certain theoretical controversies and legislative gaps in the application of smart cars in road traffic behavior. Therefore, implementing road traffic safety management system certification for relevant organizations is an effective means to encourage them to place safety and sustainability at the core of their value chain, promoting the integration of technological progress and social development. Therefore, this article aims to study the methods and process settings for implementing road traffic safety management system certification for organizations related to new smart vehicles."

It is, however, difficult to determine how these elements of gamification will fare in the long run, as well as their sustainability. Based on the Octalysis framework, this study evaluates Quizizz's gamification strategies in relation to eight core motivational drivers, which include empowerment, ownership, and social influence, which are the core motivational drivers that motivate people to act. The Octalysis Audits are conducted by Octalysis in order to identify if the platform's engagement metrics align with those of user engagement measures. As a result of the findings, Quizizz has been able to maintain high levels of user engagement and motivation by integrating intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivators. To further optimize Quizizz as an educational tool, several enhancements, such as AI-driven personalization and competitive tournaments, are being proposed to further enhance the tool."

The methods assessed include standard Box Particle Filter (Box PF), Box PF with Central Difference Kalman Filter (CDKF) enhancements, Unscented FastSLAM, Central Difference FastSLAM, and Optimal Particle Filtering approaches. Extensive simulations were performed in two real-world building environments. The results demonstrate that the enhanced Box PF variants—especially the CDKF-T variants with and without resampling—consistently outperform traditional FastSLAM methods in terms of RMSE and normalized RMSE. Moreover, these variants maintain statistical consistency as shown by NEES values close to the theoretical expectation. In contrast, Unscented and Central Difference FastSLAM methods exhibit severe overconfidence, as indicated by excessively high NEES scores. Overall, the findings suggest that hybrid Box PF frameworks with structured resampling schemes offer a reliable balance between accuracy and robustness for realtime SLAM applications."

    "abstract": "The deterministic nature of blockchain technology creates fundamental difficulties in producing secure random numbers within smart contracts, a limitation that exposes vulnerabilities in applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and blockchain-based gaming platforms. From our observations, the current state-of-the-art detection tools suffer from inadequate precision while dealing with random number vulnerabilities. To address this problem, we propose TaintSentinel, a novel path-sensitive vulnerability detection system designed to analyze smart contracts at the execution path level and gradually analyze taint with domain-specific rules. This paper discusses a solution that incorporates a multifaceted approach, integrating rule-based taint analysis to track data flow, a dual-stream neural network to identify complex vulnerability signatures, and evidence-based parameter initialization to minimize false positives. The two-phase operation of the system involves the construction of semantic graphs and the analysis of taint propagation, followed by pattern recognition using PathGNN and global structural analysis via GlobalGCN. Our experiments on 4,844 contracts demonstrate the superior performance of TaintSentinel relative to existing tools, yielding an F1-score of 0.892, an AUC-ROC of 0.94, and a PRA accuracy of 97%."

Each zonal gateway receives JPEG-compressed video via UDP from a camera module and leverages specific DDS Quality of Service (QoS) policies to republish the data, ensuring low latency for real-time applications. To validate the system’s performance, we conducted comprehensive experimental analysis, measuring end-to-end latency from camera capture to HPC reception. This explores the communication delays that can occur in a zonal architecture during DDS-based communication."

    "abstract": "Electronic Non-contact sensing technologies offer promising alternatives to conventional cuff-based blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Radar-based systems can capture cardiac mechanical activity, while photoplethysmography (PPG) reflects peripheral vascular responses. This pilot study investigated whether the time delay between radar-derived cardiac heart sounds and peripheral PPG peaks correlates with BP changes induced by exercise. Sixteen participants were recruited; thirteen provided analyzable data. Participants first completed a resting baseline with triplicate BP measurement, followed by supine recordings of radar-derived ECG and heart sounds, Biopac ECG, and Biopac PPG. After 10 minutes of cycling exercise, multimodal recordings and BP measurements were repeated. Biopac signals <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(2000 ~\\text{Hz})$</tex> were downsampled to match radar sampling <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(1000 ~\\text{Hz})$</tex>, and synchronization was performed using reference ECG electrodes. The delay between radar-derived signal peaks and subsequent PPG peaks was extracted and compared to BP. Systolic BP increased significantly after exercise (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$114.8 \\pm 15.8$</tex> mmHg vs. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$125.0 \\pm 16.9 \\text{mmHg}, \\mathrm{p}&lt;0.001$</tex>), while diastolic BP showed a smaller increase (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$65.2 \\pm 10.5 \\text{mmHg}$</tex> vs. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$67.4 \\pm 10.6 \\text{mmHg}, \\mathrm{p}=0.014)$</tex>. Heart sound-PPG delays shortened postexercise and were negatively correlated with systolic BP (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r \\approx- 0.61,\\ \\mathrm{p}&lt;0.05$</tex>). These findings suggest that radar-derived heart sounds combined with PPG provide a feasible surrogate for BP changes. Future work will integrate radar with camera-based facial PPG to enable fully non-contact BP prediction for remote health monitoring."

    "abstract": "Indonesia's e-commerce market is rapidly growing, with projections showing 99.1 million users by 2029. This growth is driven by the adoption of cashless transactions and artificial intelligence (AI) integrated into platforms like Tokopedia. Trust has a significant influence on how consumer perceive of AI, which can influence ease of use and perceived usefulness. This study investigates the role of trust in encouraging the adoption of AI technologies on e-commerce platform in Indonesia. This study collected responses from 244 participants, of whom 214 reported prior experience with AI-enabled platforms. To analyze the data, (SEM) Structural Equation Model was applied. The results demonstrated that trust exerts a significant positive influence on both perceived usefulness regarding the utility and perceived ease of use regarding the user-friendliness. Furthermore, subjective norms were found to significantly shape consumer perceptions toward AI adoption. However, perceived usefulness was found to have no direct effect on behavioral intention, whereas trust and ease of use emerged as significant determinants. Moreover, attitude toward use exhibited a positive relationship with behavioral intention, which in turn showed a strong association with actual use. These findings underscore the critical role of trust and user experience in fostering AI adoption, offering valuable implications for e-commerce platforms aiming to enhance user engagement."

    "abstract": "Cattle behaviour monitoring is an important area in precision livestock farming, as it directly influences animal welfare, reproductive health, and early disease detection. Traditional manual approaches, such as manual observation or vision-only systems, are labourintensive and often struggle to capture diverse behaviours under complex barn settings. In this work, we presented a non-invasive framework for analysing cattle behaviours using a vision-language model. The framework is based on BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining), which was trained on our cattle behaviour dataset. By jointly leveraging visual features from a Vision Transformer and textual embeddings, BLIP enables accurate classification of common behaviours, including lying, standing, resting, eating, drinking and contraction. The model generates both individual and group-level cattle activities for individual image frames before predictions are temporally smoothed across video sequences. The results highlight the potential of vision-language modelling as a reliable, informative, and non-invasive solution for livestock monitoring, achieving an accuracy of 92.4 % for behaviour classification and a BLEU-4 score of 0.64 for caption generation. This illustrated its contribution to improved welfare assessment and the advancement of innovative barn technologies."

    "abstract": "The global demand for energy is steadily increasing, and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C is a major challenge for the energy sector. Transitioning to renewable energy sources is essential to meet this goal. While electrification is expected to grow significantly, the challenge of electricity storage has become more critical. Moreover, industries such as steel, cement, chemicals, and fertilizers will be particularly difficult to electrify. For applications requiring large amounts of energy, batteries alone may not be sufficient for storage and transportation. Heavy-duty transport, shipping, and aviation, in particular, need fuels in liquid or gaseous forms, as the weight of batteries makes them impractical for these uses. Given these challenges, hydrogen emerges as a crucial solution with the potential to substantially reduce emissions and facilitate the shift towards cleaner energy systems. Furthermore, it is essential to produce hydrogen in a sustainable manner. Among the various methods for generating green hydrogen using renewable energy, water electrolysis is proving to be the most effective and is gaining considerable market attention. Various water electrolysis technologies have been developed over the years, but Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) stands out as particularly well-suited for advancing this technology due to its exceptional energy efficiency. This paper focuses on modelling of a SOEC system and its balance of plant components, employing mathematical equations to specifically address the air, fuel, and electrical aspects."

However, traditional manual cleaning requires a significant amount of manpower and poses certain dangers to the workers. To alleviate the working intensity of the personnel, a cleaning device for the cargo holds of ships was designed. This device enables the cleaning of the cargo holds to be accomplished with only a small number of personnel. A three-dimensional model was constructed using SolidWorks and imported into ANSYS Workbench for finite element static analysis. It was concluded that the strengths of the key components of the ship cargo hold cleaning device met the requirements. The modal analysis of the outer frame of the ship cargo hold cleaning device was carried out to obtain the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the outer frame. A harmonic response analysis was conducted to obtain the relationship between the amplitude and frequency. It was found that the frequency of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 0 ~ H z}$</tex> has a significant influence on the outer frame and is prone to causing resonance.

This study introduces an innovative approach to predict hip fracture risk by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with detailed medical imaging data, including stress and strain distribution. Our methodology involves processing a comprehensive dataset of patients' femoral bone information, utilizing regression techniques to determine stress and strain values, and employing these values to generate image datasets. A key challenge in this type of study is the small size of the training data which leads to poor accuracy. In order to combat this, a vision transformer model, MedViT that is more proficient in capturing long-range dependencies, has been used to predict femur fracture risk for high and low classes. The proposed framework shows superior results in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings highlight the potential of applying advanced machine learning frameworks to enhance healthcare outcomes, particularly for individuals with a high risk of hip fractures."

    "abstract": "Although the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smartphones has significantly enhanced user experiences, the underlying factors influencing consumer satisfaction in emerging markets such as Indonesia remain insufficiently explored. This study addresses that gap by examining the effects of trust in AI, perceived product quality, and pricing on user satisfaction with AI-powered smartphones. The objective is to determine which factors have the most substantial influence on satisfaction and to explore the mediating role of price perception. A quantitative causal research design was implemented, using survey data from 259 smartphone users in Bandung, Indonesia. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings reveal that product quality exerts the strongest direct influence on satisfaction, while trust in AI impacts satisfaction primarily through its influence on price perception. Among all pricing dimensions, price fairness received the lowest rating, reflecting a key concern among users. These insights suggest that smartphone manufacturers should prioritize building trust and ensuring AI feature quality, while also aligning pricing strategies with user expectations to increase satisfaction and strengthen market competitiveness."

Featuring a Lab-on-a-Chip (LoC) fluidic module, a pump, two normally-closed (NC) valves, one normally-open (NO) valve, and passive pressure compensation, the valve setup maintains at least one open flow path at all times, enabling constant pressure balance and protecting system integrity. Laboratory tests confirmed pressure resistance up to 126.5MPa and measurement accuracy within ±0.003PSU. Field deployments at 1,300m and 4,500m yielded errors of 0.0198PSU and 0.097PSU, respectively, mainly due to limited deployment durations and thermal instability. Despite these constraints, the system maintained structural integrity and stable performance, demonstrating suitability for long-term deep-sea salinity monitoring."

Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored.

Despite these advances, spatial upsampling performance remains limited in scenarios with very sparse measurements. Our proposed system, named retrieval-augmented NF (RANF), incorporates HRTFs retrieved from a dataset as auxiliary inputs. We leverage multiple retrievals via transform-average-concatenate and adopt a PEFT technique tailored for retrieval augmentation. Furthermore, we capitalize on the results of a signal-processing-based spatial upsampling method as optional inputs. By incorporating these auxiliary inputs, our system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the SONICOM dataset and placed first in Task 2 of the LAP challenge 2024."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of redundant information accumulation, low computational efficiency, and fuzzy feature allocation in multiscale time-series prediction of traditional deep echo state network (DeepESN), this article proposed an interlayer sparse compression-based DeepESN model (ICS-DESN). The model uses the sparse sampling technology of deep fusion compressive sensing and the hierarchical dynamic feature extraction mechanism of DeepESN, introduces the adaptive compressed sampling module between the layers, and uses the Gaussian observation matrix to reduce the dimension of the high-dimensional state, which effectively inhibits the stacking of redundant information in the deep network, and explicitly allocates the multiscale temporal features. Through theoretical analysis, it is proven that ICS-DESN satisfies the stability condition of the echo state property (ESP) by constraining the weighted spectral radius of the reservoir. In the experiment, we used multiscenario time-series datasets, such as logistic chaotic systems, Lorenz attractors, sunspot data, NASDAQ stock index, ETTh1 dataset, and weather dataset to validate the effectiveness of the model. The results showed that compared with traditional comparison models, ICS-DESN significantly reduced prediction errors [mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)], demonstrating higher computational efficiency and robustness. This research provides an efficient theoretical framework for complex time-series modeling and has potential application value in resource-constrained scenarios, such as edge computing."

    "abstract": "In urban centers, cycling is increasingly popular as an eco-friendly transportation mode and a short-distance transport option, driving higher demand for accurate bicycle travel time estimation. Policymakers need to understand bicycle traffic for urban traffic management and sustainable transport promotion, while cyclists benefit from better route planning and improved network efficiency. However, urban bicycle travel time estimation has not received as much attention as car traffic estimation and presents several challenges: 1) Limited availability of structural cycling data, which can be inaccessible due to privacy concerns and/or severely biased by user demographics. 2) The diverse and complex behaviors of cyclists. 3) The lack of strict road constraints for cyclists and frequent rule violations, complicating the model definition of a comprehensive cycling infrastructure network. This paper presents the first study on urban bicycle travel time estimation using GPS tracking data. Leveraging graph-based deep learning’s ability to learn from topological network information, we introduce the Dual Graph-based approach for bicycles (DG4b), which employs two parallel encode-process-decode pipelines: one for a shared undirected road network graph to capture intrinsic road characteristics, and another for a directed trip-specific graph reflecting unique trip features. The outputs are combined to estimate road segment speeds and overall trip travel time. When applied to a real-world dataset from Berlin, our method shows superior accuracy and reliability compared to baseline models, while maintaining low complexity. Our approach provides a novel perspective on integrating bicycling-specific characteristics and aims to inspire more future research in bicycle-related traffic estimation."

    "abstract": "Although automatic speech recognition technology has become widespread, it still exhibits limited performance when processing speech from cochlear implant (CI) users. This limitation serves as a barrier that hinders CI users' accessibility to digital technology. To address this issue, a comparative study of fine-tuning strategies was conducted to effectively adapt Whisper, a general-purpose speech recognition model, to CI users' speech. Specifically, the performance of full fine-tuning, selective fine-tuning, adapter, and LoRA were evaluated based on Korean CI user's speech dataset. The experimental results showed that all the fine-tuning approaches improved recognition performance compared to the baseline Whisper model. Notably, LoRA-encoder approach, which involved training only 2.15% of the total parameters, achieved the best performance with a character error rate of 11.57%, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, strategies that fine-tuned only the encoder consistently showed higher performance than those that adjusted the decoder, confirming that the encoder's role is crucial in modeling the unique acoustic characteristics of CI users' speech."

    "abstract": "Due to the various constraints in the communication process, such as bandwidth, quantization, time delay, etc., it will inevitably have some impacts on the performance of communication networked systems. More seriously, it will cause the system to lose its stability. This study investigates the output tracking performance (OTP) of communication networked systems under the combined effects of uncertain time delays, packet losses, and channel noise. By using the methods of first order Pade approximation, all-pass decomposition and Youla parameterization, the explicit expressions of OTP are derived by the design of the optimal controller, which mainly contain single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and two-degree-of-freedom(TDOF), respectively. The results show that the OTP of NCSs has strong connections with the inherent properties of the plant and the communication parameters of channel. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical results is verified by the simulations for the inverted pendulum system."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of sensor and information technology, multi-sensor data related to system degradation processes are now readily available for condition monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, this process is often complicated by the presence of censored sensor data. In this article, we propose a novel method called Bayesian LSTM-SURV, which integrates Survival Analysis (SA) with Neural Networks (NNs) to model the nonlinear relationship between degradation signals and RUL. This method addresses censored signals and the lack of RUL labels through a novel loss function. Additionally, we employ a Bayesian procedure to transfer information from the training data, enhancing the accuracy of predictions for the test data and maximizing the utilization of existing data. Instead of directly predicting RUL values, we assume that the lifetime follows a Weibull distribution. By modeling the lifetime distribution and survival function, we can calculate and predict RUL values while quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions. The advantageous features of the proposed method are demonstrated through simulation studies and its application to a high-fidelity gas turbine engine dataset."

The major challenge in HRM is the accurate prediction and evaluation of employee performance. In this research, we propose a Hybrid Machine Learning (ML) approach, specifically the Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to predict employee performance. Data was collected from three companies and has 15 different features. The dataset was preprocessed and normalized to identify major features affecting employee performance. The performance of the Hybrid model is evaluated using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The overall accuracy was 97 %. The FNN-XGBoost showed better performance compared to the other conventional ML techniques, accurately predicting employee outcomes, flagging potential attrition risks, and identifying low performers. This approach enables HR departments to implement proactive performance management strategies by facilitating timely and informed decision-making. The study highlights the role of ML in improving HRM processes by identifying critical performance determinants and enabling data-driven decision-making for organizational advancement."

This research seeks to examine the digital ecosystem of students' distance learning experiences, focusing on five primary factors: time management flexibility, content flexibility, lecturer contact flexibility, online communication self-efficacy, and self-regulated effort, in relation to student satisfaction in distance learning. Quantitative approaches were employed via an online survey targeting Indonesian students with experience in distant learning courses. The PLS-SEM analysis conducted on 149 participants revealed that all variables significantly influenced student satisfaction, with the exception of online communication self-efficacy, which did not mitigate the association between interaction flexibility with lecturers and learning satisfaction. This research is limited by its sample coverage and does not account for characteristics such as computer self-efficacy. Additional research is advised to investigate the context of particular degrees or academic programs. These findings offer practical implications for universities to develop adaptive online learning systems tailored to student needs, while reinforcing the theoretical framework of Self-Determination Theory to elucidate the significance of autonomy and intrinsic motivation within the digital learning environment."

    "abstract": "The rising popularity of mobile fitness applications has transformed how individuals engage with exercise, yet many existing platforms remain limited by static workout plans that fail to adapt to users’ physical states or changing schedules. This study presents a mobile system designed to dynamically generate, schedule, and adjust workout plans based on contextual fatigue estimation from user inputs. The application incorporates a workout generation module tailored to user goals, fitness levels, and limitations, combined with a scheduling algorithm that identifies optimal exercise gaps from calendar availability. A multi-factor fatigue model was developed using mood, resting heart rate, sleep duration, schedule density, perceived fatigue, and historical data, processed through Gaussian penalty functions and smoothed with an Exponential Moving Average to ensure stability. The resulting fatigue score enables real-time workout adjustment, modifying exercise intensity or rescheduling sessions when necessary. A prototype was implemented using React Native with Firebase integration, and tested with real-world data through four simulated representative user personas: consistent, busy, sick, and casual users. Results showed that the application effectively adjusts generated workout plans in response to fatigue fluctuations. While limitations remain, such as reliance on manual input, findings highlight the potential for contextual fitness applications to enhance personalization, prevent overtraining, and improve long-term adherence."

The results of this study provide information on the required sampling frequency and spectral purity of a waveform generator when the waveforms are intended to be reproduced. The achieved results emphasize the need of using Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) which is a quantum-based waveform generator. Then, the synthesized waveforms are pulse modulated to be reproduced by JAWS. The scripts are validated by biasing the JAWS system operated in a cryocooler. Power grid representative synthetic waveforms are selected for this study. Measurement setup and results proving that the scripts are working as intended are presented."

The proposed framework comprises: (1) a fitness function that combines control-input energy, position error, and tilt angle; and (2) a trajectory-shaping procedure that quantifies the impact of trajectory shaping on energy consumption and transient response. We compare several reference inputs— step, first-order model-reference, ramp, and Linear Segment with Parabolic Blends (LSPB). Simulation results indicate that PSO-tuned LQR can significantly reduce control energy subject to prescribed tracking requirements. The choice of reference signal has a clear influence on energy: the ramp input yields the lowest energy consumption, whereas the step input produces the fastest response at a higher energy cost."

    "abstract": "Due to persistent electricity shortages and frequent outages in Libya, this research investigates the integration of a hybrid solar photovoltaic (PV) and grid-connected power solution for the Venice Dental Clinic (VDC), a healthcare facility located in Benghazi. The primary objective is to ensure a reliable energy supply, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and promote sustainability. PVsyst software is used for precise solar system design and sizing, while MATLAB/Simulink is employed to implement and simulate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based energy management controller. Results show that activation function selection significantly influences model accuracy. Using the Tanh function, the optimal network configuration involves two hidden layers with three neurons each, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.5718. By contrast, the ReLU function improves model performance, with a three-layer configuration (10, 8, and 5 neurons) producing a lower MSE of 0.3937. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ANN in making real-time energy distribution decisions under variable operating conditions. The optimized system is capable of meeting up to 85% of the clinic’s energy demand, reducing annual electricity costs by approximately 40%, and lowering carbon emissions substantially. This work not only validates the feasibility of intelligent hybrid systems in healthcare but also establishes VDC as a replicable case study model for wider application across both public and private institutions in Libya and beyond."

    "abstract": "Healthcare data sharing is fundamental for advancing medical research and enhancing patient care, yet it faces significant challenges in privacy, data ownership, and interoperability due to fragmented data silos across institutions and strict regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Patients possess distributed records across multiple hospitals, each maintaining autonomous databases. Access to consolidated records by secondary entities mandates explicit patient consent while ensuring strict isolation between multi-tenant datasets, requiring fine-grained access control across organizational boundaries. Existing solutions exhibit critical limitations: blockchain-based databases lack robust fine-grained cryptographic enforcement of dynamic access policies, while TEE-enhanced systems suffer from synchronization overhead and poor scalability in distributed deployments. To bridge these gaps, we propose MtDB, a novel decentralized database architecture addressing secure data sharing in multi-tenant database ecosystems. MtDB employs blockchain for metadata coordination and sharing, IPFS for distributed data addressing, a universal SQL query interface for data access, and Intel SGX for integrity-protected query execution with enforced access control. We provide an open-source implementation demonstrating MtDB’s capabilities for secure, patient-centric healthcare data sharing while preserving ownership and enforcing policies. Experimental results show MtDB achieves 35 milliseconds query latency for indexed queries over 400M multi-tenant medical records while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees, with only 1.2–1.3× performance overhead compared to non-secure baselines."

This paper explores how the various design parameters of the pyramidal absorber impact its performance, aiming to identify optimal design values for enhanced efficiency. Factors such as permittivity, loss tangent, height of the pyramidal structure, and the thickness of the base all influence the absorber's performance. The pyramidal absorber supported by a 0.5 mm thick iron plate was investigated using the CST Microwave suite over the frequency range (1-10) GHz, where the reflection coefficient and power density distribution are studied. The study showed that lower permittivity or permeability leads to lower reflectivity, while lower loss still gives higher reflectivity. Increasing the pyramid's height and the base's thickness leads to lower reflection, but the first is more effective. The investigated pyramidal absorbers with a height of 16 cm, and equal values of permittivity and permeability, achieved a reflection coefficient lower than -70 dB across most of the 1 to 10 GHz frequency range."

In this work, we apply audio data augmentation in order to increase learning data for bat swing motion classification. Since audio data can be expressed as waveforms, we similarly treat waveforms of bat swing data collected by an acceleration sensor. Experimental results show that audio data augmentation is effective for bat swing motion classification."

Therefore, establishing a model capable of effectively processing multi-source observation data while mitigating errors is crucial for enhancing tracking accuracy and system stability. This paper integrates a TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) model with a Kalman filter-based multi-source data fusion approach to reduce cross-system error propagation; introduces an improved K-means clustering algorithm combined with trajectory interpolation techniques to strengthen trajectory continuity and precision for multi-target scenarios; and employs error propagation modeling along with trajectory interpolation methods to reconstruct missing data and address trajectory fragmentation, thereby improving system robustness."

However, in the face of complex operating conditions and nonlinear, time-varying system characteristics, the limitations of traditional control strategies are becoming increasingly apparent. This article proposes an intelligent control strategy optimization method based on deep learning, aiming to improve the stability, accuracy, and adaptability of hydraulic transmission systems. The study used a combination of deep neural networks (DNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to construct an intelligent control model to handle the nonlinearity and dynamic changes of hydraulic systems. Through simulation experiments, compared with traditional PID control strategies, the new strategy exhibits significant advantages in system robustness under step response, sine wave tracking, and external disturbances. The experimental results show that deep learning control strategies can significantly improve system stability (reduce 60% of output fluctuation standard deviation), enhance control accuracy, increase mean absolute error (MAE) by nearly three times, accelerate response speed (increase by about 52 %), and improve energy efficiency ratio (increase by about 9 %). These achievements have validated the potential and value of deep learning technology in the field of intelligent control of hydraulic transmission systems, providing a new technological path for industrial automation."

    "abstract": "Pneumonia stands as one of the principal factors leading to mortality rates primarily affecting children in areas with limited resources. The early identification and precise diagnosis of pneumonia serves as the most important factor for lowering mortality rates. The research assesses different ResNet models as they identify pneumonia presence in chest X-ray images. A total of 5,863 labeled images between normal and pneumonia categories serve as the training and evaluation basis for the models. Performance measurements consisting of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and AUC ROC serve to evaluate the models. ResNet50 surpasses all competing models by reaching 97.9% accuracy and producing precision at 97.3% and recall at 97.8%. The model performance of ResNet50 demonstrates excellent results with an AUC value of 0.9974. The performance of ResNet101 V2 and ResNet152 V2 models shows robust results through their AUC values reaching 0.9954 and 0.9947, respectively. The research establishes deep learning models specifically ResNet architectures as powerful tools for automatic pneumonia detection tasks. The next phase of research needs to concentrate on generalization improvements of detection models while implementing multiple data sources and establishing medical system integration for better pneumonia diagnosis accessibility."

    "abstract": "This brief presents a high-precision passive vector phase shifter with 360◦ phase tunability for satellite communications. The innovative topology consists of a quadrature filter (QAF), an input matching circuit, a 180° phase rotator, an analog attenuator, an amplitude compensation and an output matching circuit. The phase shifter, based on the principles of a vector modulator, provides 360° linear control range with resolution better than 5.625°. The experimental results show that the phase error of this phase shifter is 3.4° from 10.7GHz to 12.7GHz. The measured amplitude variations of 64 phase states fall in the range of -0.44 dB to +0.38 dB. Meanwhile, the measured root-mean-square (rms) phase accuracy of different frequencies is better than 1.9° over 10.7GHz to 12.7GHz, achieving 0°-360°phase shift with almost flat phase response. The proposed phase shifter, which is able to cover X- and Ku-bands, is a good candidate for broadband phased array applications."

    "abstract": "In contemporary digital cryptography, the public key method is known. In public key cryptography, encryption and decryption keys are required. The public key algorithms used to secure messages are the LUC algorithm and the Vincent- Sathiyamoorthy RSA algorithm. In solving the LUC algorithm there is a simple public key generation by multiplying a specified prime number for the key n. To determine e, a relatively prime number is sought. The relative prime number is found using the modulo division function. The private key generation involves finding d and requires the public key e. Data encryption is done using the public key (e, n) and decryption transforms the encoded data using the private key (d, n). The Vincent-Sathiyamoorthy RSA key generation involves only one prime number and other values are non-prime numbers. To obtain n variables such as p, q, r, s, t and e are needed. Private key generation depends on variables p, u and t in the public key generation. In the encryption and decryption processes, the Vincent- Sathiyamoorthy RSA algorithm is faster than the LUC algorithm. In testing the encryption and decryption processes using the .doc file extension with different character lengths, it can be concluded that the longer the characters length processed during encryption and decryption, the longer the encryption and decryption processes take. We have added recommendations to test the algorithms on other file formats and under real network conditions to observe the effects of latency and throughput."

    "abstract": "Otolaryngology (ENT) procedure in outpatient settings presents several challenges such as procedural complexity, assistant dependency, and high infection risks due to its nature. To address these challenges, this paper presents a semi-autonomous, dual-arm robotic system for ENT outpatient procedures designed for a separated-space configuration. The system’s design is based on an ENT-specific task and workspace analysis, which establishes the detailed specifications for control parameters and hardware configurations required for implementing various procedures. The system integrates an automated tool-changing system that can handle instruments such as suction, swabs, and forceps, enabling a complete diagnostic and therapeutic workflow managed by a single clinician. The total coordinated workflow is designed within a dual-perspective framework, implemented as a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM), which translates high-level clinical intent into executable robotic actions through an intuitive user interface, refined through extensive UX/UI research. Experimental evaluations verified the usability of the implemented system throughout the entire workflow. The platform makes solo-physician ENT procedures available via teleoperation, reducing assistant dependency, physician workload, and the potential for infection. This adaptable framework offers a comprehensive solution for improving ENT clinical practice and can be extended to other medical domains that demand advanced automated workflow execution."

    "abstract": "Database parameter automatic tuning is one of the challenging and difficult tasks that database administrators (DBAs) frequently encounter in artificial intelligence (AI) enabled database (DB) systems. Preferentially optimizing key parameters emerges as a critical point in addressing this issue, and it can help identify important parameters by exploring the interactions between parameters. Aiming to overcome the disadvantages of existing methods, we propose a collaborative multi-agents model called CMA+DB to automatically tune DB parameters in an effective and efficient fashion. CMA+DB integrates three components including SAPM (Single-Agent Pre-trained Model), MATM (Multi-Agent Joint Training Model), and PJTM (Probability-based Joint Training Model). SAPM applies the deep deterministic policy gradient to explore the impact of one single agent on DB performance, MATM uses multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients to find agents that collaboratively work to improve DB performance, and PJTM can enhance parameter tuning by important agents based on a probabilistic selection factor. In the CMA+DB model, each agent is responsible for tuning a portion of the parameters, and multiple agents collaborate to recommend the optimal parameter configuration. This hybrid model can expand the number of tunable parameters in order to perform parameter tuning from the aspects of functions and parameter levels (i.e., global, DB, and session level). Experimental results reveal that CMA+DB obtains the fastest convergence performance (when reaching the largest throughput) of 14.83% faster than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in the TPC-C benchmark on average. Essentially, after the phase of SAPM model training, CMA+DB outperforms the performance of the SOTA models in throughput. Furthermore, DB performance of CMA+DB can be improved by 1.758% through the phases of MATM and PJTM model training."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a correlation-based three-stage channel estimation strategy with low pilot overhead for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which both users and base station (BS) are equipped with a hybrid radio frequency (RF) architecture. In Stage I, all users jointly transmit pilots and the uncompressed received signals are recovered to estimate the angles of arrival (AoAs) at the BS using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based approach enhanced by angle rotation method. Then, we propose a novel decomposition method that the overall cascaded MIMO channel can be directly decomposed into multiple multiple-input single-output (MISO) sub-channels, based on which the cascaded channels for a typical user and remaining users are estimated in Stage II and Stage III. Specifically, in Stage II, ultilizing the invariance of angles and the linear correlation of gains among different cascaded subchannels, we use compressive sensing (CS), least squares (LS), and a one-dimensional search to estimate the overall cascaded channel of the typical user. In Stage III, the remaining users independently transmit pilots to estimate their individual cascaded channel with the same approach as in Stage II, which exploits the equivalent common RIS-BS channel obtained in Stage II to reduce the pilot overhead. In addition, the hybrid combining matrix and the RIS phase shift matrix are designed to reduce the noise power, thereby further improving the estimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve high estimation accuracy especially when the number of antennas at the users is small, and can significantly reduce pilot overhead compared with the existing benchmark approach."

    "abstract": "High-temperature superconducting (HTS) rotating machines have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation electric propulsion and energy systems requiring high efficiency and power density. One of the major technical challenges in such systems is realizing cryogenic cooling of the rotating components—especially the field rotor—without mechanical contact with stationary cooling sources such as cryocoolers or heat exchangers. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel non-contact thermal coupling structure, referred to as the Gas Blow Coupling (GBC). The GBC enables cryogenic cooling by reducing thermal resistance between a stationary cryocooler and a rotating HTS device through a fluid-based thermal medium. The cooling process operates in two stages: in the initial phase, heat is transferred by conduction across a narrow fluid gap to establish minimum operating conditions. In the operational phase, once the rotor begins to spin, forced convection is induced by an impeller attached to the rotor, enhancing heat transfer via fluid circulation. This dual-mode cooling approach simplifies the system architecture while maintaining thermal reliability under cryogenic conditions. The conceptual design and thermal performance of the GBC are evaluated through numerical simulations, confirming its feasibility as an effective thermal interface for rotating HTS applications."

The results are validated against independent full-wave electromagnetic simulations."

Visualization has the potential to facilitate the mapping and analysis of these complex relationships, but capturing structured information from unstructured story data remains a challenge. As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, we see an opportunity to use their text processing and analysis capabilities to augment and reimagine existing storyline visualization techniques. Toward this goal, we introduce an LLM-driven data parsing pipeline that automatically extracts relevant narrative information from novels and scripts. We then apply this pipeline to create STORY RIBBONS, an interactive visualization system that helps novice and expert literary analysts explore detailed character and theme trajectories at multiple narrative levels. Through pipeline evaluations and user studies with STORY RIBBONS on 36 literary works, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs to streamline narrative visualization creation and reveal new insights about familiar stories. We also describe current limitations of AI-based systems, and interaction motifs designed to address these issues."

    "abstract": "The designs and working principles of bioinspired inchworm-type piezoelectric actuators have been well studied in recent literature, with promising applications in precision engineering. However, it is challenging to extend the existing methods to cross-scale planar motion scenarios, which significantly limits the applicability of these actuators. In this article, a parallel, two-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric inchworm actuator is proposed, bioinspired by the skeletal structure of a snake’s spine with a novel active swing driving unit. Unlike conventional series-type actuators that utilize on separate modules for different directions of motion, the proposed design enables 2-D cross-scale parallel inchworm motion in the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">XY</i> plane by actively switching between swing and translational modes using a shared clamp–drive–clamp assembly. A systematic design of the biomimetic piezoelectric actuator is presented, where modeling and analysis of the driving and clamping units are also supported by finite-element simulations. A design prototype was fabricated, and comprehensive experiments were conducted, demonstrating better performance than representative results in the literature. In particular, the actuator achieves high-performance planar cross-scale trajectory tracking and positioning with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">XY</i> collaboration in full-step and sub-step scenarios.

    "abstract": "Current learning-based image denoising methods have achieved impressive performance. However, their reliance on deep neural architectures and large paired datasets limits their applicability in data-limited or edge computing scenarios. Motivated by the expressive functional approximation power of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), here we present ZS-KAN-a lightweight yet highly effective and computationally efficient zero-shot denoising method. ZS-KAN combines the computational efficiency of convolutional neural networks with the representational flexibility of KANs, achieving competitive denoising performance while requiring only 1%-25% of the parameters used by other recent zero-shot approaches. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy data demonstrate that ZS-KAN achieves comparable or even superior performance to state-of-the-art zero-shot methods while maintaining significantly lower model complexity. These advantages highlight the potential of ZS-KAN for practical deployment.

    "abstract": "Large assemblies of extremely simple robots capable only of basic motion activities (like propelling forward or self-rotating) are often applied to study swarming behavior or implement various phenomena characteristic of active matter composed of non-equilibrium particles that convert their energy to a directed motion. As a result, a great abundance of compact swarm robots have been developed. The simplest are bristle-bots that self-propel via converting their vibration with the help of elastic bristles. However, many platforms are optimized for a certain class of studies, are not always made open-source, or have limited customization potential. To address these issues, we develop the open-source Swarmodroid 1.0 platform based on bristle-bots with reconfigurable 3D printed bodies and simple electronics that possess external control of motion velocity and demonstrate basic capabilities of trajectory adjustment. Then, we perform a detailed analysis of individual Swarmodroids’ motion characteristics and their kinematics. In addition, we introduce the AMPy software package in Python that features OpenCV-based extraction of robotic swarm kinematics accompanied by the evaluation of key physical quantities describing the collective dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential applications as well as further directions for fundamental studies and Swarmodroid 1.0 platform development."

Attackers exploit the human element, requiring new approaches that sustain attention and promote actionable decision-making. This paper evaluates a narrative-driven, choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) serious game designed to teach core cyber-hygiene practices. Narrative drafts were generated with the assistance of AI-based text generation tools and subsequently refined by the research team, illustrating the potential of AI to support scalable development of cybersecurity training content. Two design variables were systematically compared: narrative depth (long-form versus short-form storytelling) and interaction modality (link-based versus swipe-based navigation). A total of 422 participants were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk, representing a diverse adult population. Outcomes were measured through custom Likert-style items assessing engagement, usability, and perceived learning, supported by qualitative reflections. Results show that long-form narratives increased immersion and contextual understanding, while short-form narratives emphasized efficiency and decision reinforcement. Usability ratings were high across all conditions, with swipe-based navigation slightly preferred on mobile devices. Participants consistently reported increased awareness of phishing, oversharing, identity theft, and ransomware. These findings demonstrate the viability of narrative-driven games as scalable, user-centered cybersecurity training tools. We discuss design implications for organizations deploying awareness programs across heterogeneous desktop and mobile platforms and highlight opportunities for hybrid narrative strategies that balance immersion and efficiency."

This study investigates the indirect influence of AI on tourist advocacy via SIS, perceived destination image (PDI), and perceived tourist satisfaction (PTS), grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework. Data from 100 respondents across Indonesia, Japan, and Malaysia were analyzed using PLS-SEM. Results show AI does not significantly affect SIS (p = 0.316), diverging from prior assumptions. However, SIS significantly influences both PDI (p = 0.002) and PTS (p < 0.001), which in turn significantly affect tourist advocacy (PDI: p = 0.036; PTS: p = 0.001). SIS explains 12.8% of PDI and 21% of PTS, while both contribute to 23.2% of advocacy behaviour. These findings validate the S-O-R model in a tourism tech context and suggest that enhancing SIS functionality can strengthen destination image, satisfaction, and advocacy despite AI’s limited direct impact."

Tilapia, a staple protein in the region, is impacted by pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrite, and ammonia nitrogen, which are negatively impacted by agricultural runoff, municipal waste, and aquaculture pollutants. Understanding how pH, DO, nitrite, and ammonia nitrogen change across the lake would allow cage fish farmers to optimize cage placement and fish care, and inform environmental groups and regulatory bodies in improving lake health. This preliminary study attempts to map these parameters at various lake depths and distances from shore, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not yet been done on Lake Victoria. The data collected shows ideal tilapia fish farming conditions are not uniform, with more favorable conditions further from shore. Our findings suggest that more extensive water parameter mapping could determine ideal fish cage locations and help vested groups respond to lake conditions."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have become a game changer for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to improve their customer service, however, AI finds its place in the market by targeting MSMEs that do not have access to resources for the creation of AI agents. Automation of system-independent operations for the use of interactions is a competent tool that helps MSMEs to increase their competitiveness based on an automated customer management system, which functions at a lower level of operating costs. AI agents are transformed to improve MSMEs’ operations in customer service by changing their interaction systems while this study will determine the basic success factors during implementation. This research method uses qualitative interviews with 10 MSME owners who implement AI Chatbot for customer services in their businesses. The customer benefits of AI agents are the fact that the system is effective in answering standard questions that enable people to solve complex problems while providing the same quality of service at scale. System design and user acceptance need to be addressed as these barriers are against the implementation of technological solutions. AI agents enable small businesses to experience equal access to highly sophisticated customer service tools, giving them the ability to compete in the digital business market. Business stakeholders need to target the development of support systems and policies that are accessible to MSMEs by addressing AI in their movement to realize economic equality through technological advancement."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Threshold signatures serve as a cryptographic primitive fundamental to blockchain security and reliability. However, a significant limitation of existing ECDSA threshold signature protocols is their lack of robustness during the signing phase. Specifically, the presence of even a single malicious participant requires the termination of the protocol, thereby undermining the availability of the system. To address this critical issue, we present a novel robust threshold ECDSA signature scheme that guarantees uninterrupted operation even in the presence of adversarial participants. Our scheme consists of three distinct phases: distributed key generation, offline pre-signing and online signing. During the offline pre-signing phase, pre-signing shares are generated in advance to ensure fault-tolerant online signing. A key innovation of our approach is the offloading of computationally intensive operations to the offline phase, significantly optimizing the online signing efficiency. Security analysis demonstrates that our scheme achieves active security under the Strong RSA and Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumptions. Compared to prior work, our solution not only ensures robustness but also reduces communication and computational overhead, making it particularly suitable for real-world blockchain deployments where both efficiency and fault tolerance are paramount."

In 2019, KiloWatts for Humanity (KWH), a U.S.based nonprofit organization, in partnership with Caritas Monze, a Zambian nonprofit organization, and in close collaboration with the community, implemented a 3 kilowatt solar energy kiosk. The solar energy kiosk is operated by the Lower Kafue Women's Group, a local community-based organization. In 2024, the aging components coupled with the growth of demand for electricity motivated KWH and Caritas Monze to expand the solar energy kiosk's electrical capacity and physical building space. The case study describes the social, economic, technical, and organizational aspects of the Cheeba solar energy kiosk."

Facial recognition-based Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are increasingly targeted by presentation attacks (PAs), including printed photographs, video replays, and 3D masks. To mitigate these threats, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) systems are critical components of robust authentication pipelines. While recent advances have centered around deep and complex neural network architectures to enhance PAD performance, these models often exhibit limitations when faced with out-of-distribution samples and scarce training data.In this study, we explore a data-centric approach to PAD by leveraging a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) as a fixed feature extractor, coupled with a lightweight classification head. We hypothesize that, given access to sufficiently diverse training data, such a simplified architecture can match or exceed the performance of more intricate models. Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios validate our hypothesis, demonstrating competitive accuracy and improved generalizability. These findings emphasize the efficacy of scalable, data-driven methodologies over architectural complexity in PAD system design."

Wrong predictions regarding crop yields play a vital role in protecting world food security. The proposed research utilizes TabNet Regressor as a Deep Learning (DL) regression model to forecast crop yields from worldwide agricultural data covering multiple crops and multiple countries. The implementation of Optuna as a hyperparameter tuner resulted in the best possible predictive results. Using Optuna enables the process to identify optimal parameters such as optimizer function, learning rate, batch size, and number of steps within the TabNet architecture framework. Multiple agricultural records obtained from several countries allowed the model to become robust while being evaluated across various crops under multiple environmental scenarios. Model optimization yielded an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> value of 95.8% which indicates great capability to forecast. The research demonstrates that TabNet Regressor serves as an efficient model for yielding better predictions of crop yields. DL combined with hyperparameter optimization techniques delivers important insights which enable policymakers together with farmers and agricultural organizations to conduct data-driven sustainable farming practices decisions. One of the key challenges that this study is overcoming is that extant models lack a wide range of data. The analysis of a global dataset and TabNet Regressor improvement allow the research to reach high levels of prediction and, therefore, make credible projections in a wide range of agricultural conditions."

Specifically, PolyLink introduces a decentralized crowdsourcing architecture that supports single-device and cross-device model deployment and inference across heterogeneous devices at the edge. Moreover, to ensure the inference integrity, we design the TIQE protocol, which combines a lightweight cross-encoder model and an LLM-as-a-Judge for a high-accuracy inference evaluation. Lastly, we integrate a comprehensive token-based incentive model with dynamic pricing and reward mechanisms for all participants. We have deployed PolyLink and conducted an extensive real-world evaluation through geo-distributed deployment across heterogeneous devices. Results indicate that the inference and verification latency is practical. Our security analysis demonstrates that the system is resistant to model degradation attacks and validator corruptions.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for home electricity necessitates innovative approaches to balance the consumption of energy with cost-saving. In this paper, a priority scheduling system for home appliances using a greedy optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize energy expenditure without compromising user comfort. By dynamically assigning priority to devices based on need and usage patterns, the algorithm allocates optimal operating times to high-priority devices (e.g., refrigerators, lighting) when tariff rates are lowest and off-peak period assignment for low-priority devices (e.g., washing machines, entertainment systems). Greedy approach imposes household power capacity constraint satisfaction as well as budget constraints by iteratively taking optimally cost-minimal scheduling decisions. Testing in several different residential environments demonstrates a 22–30% reduction in monthly electricity costs and a 15–25% reduction in peak-load demand compared to unoptimized consumption. The system also provides actionable feedback for load shifting, enabling consumers to avoid grid overloads and adopt environmentally friendly consumption habits. This work demonstrates the potential of algorithmic-based prioritization in transforming residential energy management without compromising convenience of lifestyle."

While keeping pace with current technological developments, social media has become more advanced and increasingly populated by people from around the globe, with a wider variance in audience, which can increase the chance of negatively impacting interactions. One result of such interactions is lower self-esteem, potentially worsening into self-harm or even suicide in the worst-case scenario. To raise awareness of the dangers associated with the situation, this study, utilizing RoBERTa, aims to detect and classify mental illnesses through user-generated text or posts on social media. We used a publicly available dataset from previous research to test it, by applying a supervised learning approach and fine-tuning the hyperparameters. After testing, the model has an 89% accuracy in classifying users with mental illness. Other than that, the model has a high recall, indicating its effectiveness in identifying even subtle hints in the text. With the results shown by the model, it is evident that AI has the potential to be a major helper in detecting mental illness and notifying people of early interventions."

In high voltage battery monitoring system, it is important to measure the voltage of hundreds of battery-cells using fewer monitoring ICs. In general, the system is composed of a micro-controller (MCU) for controlling and processing the measured voltage monitoring data, and the chain of several battery monitoring ICs. Since the ground levels of each ICs connected to battery cells are different, the communication of this system is implemented by isolated communication. For improving reliability, we propose following two methods. First, compensating the sampling baud rate and the frequency of oscillator at each receiving commands using the synchronization frame of MCU. Second, a representative physical layer structure optimized for isolated communication is introduced. These methods can highly improve the reliability and robustness of asynchronous isolated communication."

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust estimation of the Sun’s direction is a critical requirement for attitude determination systems in small-scale aerospace platforms such as UAVs and CubeSats. This paper presents a low-cost Sun sensor design based on discrete photodiodes arranged over symmetric polyhedral geometries—specifically, the icosahedron and the truncated icosahedron. A simulation framework has been developed in MATLAB to evaluate Sun vector estimation using a least-squares method, incorporating realistic photodiode characteristics and system noise. Two sensor configurations, using 12 and 20 photodiodes respectively, are tested and compared in terms of accuracy, coverage, and a proposed optimization metric that quantifies performance per sensor. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that while the icosahedron configuration offers marginally higher efficiency, it suffers from larger worst-case errors. In contrast, the truncated icosahedron maintains bounded errors below 2°, providing more reliable performance across the entire field of view. The results highlight a practical trade-off between average efficiency and robustness in geometric sensor deployment for Sun sensing applications."

    "abstract": "Fake accounts and bots flood social media with spam, rumors, and harmful content, so we tested machine learning to spot them using three paths. Classic models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost check numeric clues like post rate or follower growth. Deep nets like LSTM read timelines in sequence and catch style shifts. Blended teams let many models vote when one feels unsure. Our recipe is clear: collect raw account data, turn each action into clean features, train on labeled bots and humans, then judge performance with accuracy, recall, and area under the curve. In live trials classic models already score above ninety percent while deep nets climb higher when fed large data sets. Tools like Botometer and Bot Sentinel confirm the method by rating real accounts in seconds. We keep jargon light so any reader can follow the flow yet still include the technical steps for those who want detail. This work shows that smart models, clear features, and honest testing pull the mask off social bots and protect online conversation."

    "abstract": "Tilapia fish farming is one of the important sectors of the fisheries industry in Indonesia. However, the success of tilapia fish farming is highly dependent on the quality of the pond water. To overcome this problem, an effective and efficient solution is needed. In this study, an Android-based tilapia fishpond water quality monitoring system was developed. This system allows farmers to monitor important water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, and water turbidity in real time via mobile devices. The data collected by the sensor is then sent to the server via the internet, and then the data is displayed in graphical form using third-party software called UBIDOTS. The results of this study indicate that the developed device can work well and has accurate reading results. Furthermore, direct testing needs to be carried out on the fish farming pond so that the effectiveness of the developed system can be analyzed."

    "abstract": "On specialized hardware like the Xilinx Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU), the theoretical efficiency of a neural network model often does not translate into real-world performance. This work investigates a hardware-software co-design methodology for adapting lightweight models to the DPU architecture through an exploratory case study. We replaced the encoders of ERFNet and ESNet with the DPU-friendly MobileNetV2 and evaluated the performance on the Xilinx Kria KV260 platform. While this co-design strategy boosted ERFNet’s DPU-only inference throughput by 2.14x (from 9.05 to 19.36 FPS), the end-to-end system throughput—including pre-and post-processing—remained stalled at roughly 0.35 FPS. This outcome provides empirical evidence of a \"bottleneck shift,\" where the performance constraint migrates from the DPU hardware to CPU-bound software routines. Our findings emphasize that achieving true real-time performance in embedded AI systems requires a holistic optimization of the entire pipeline, not just the neural network accelerator."

    "abstract": "In this study, an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) filter algorithm is developed for tracking highly maneuverable targets such as FPV drones. Constant Velocity (CV), Coordinated Turn (CT), and Constant Acceleration (CA) motion models of targets are created in MATLAB simulation environment, and performance analyses are conducted towards classic Kalman filter, using measurements corrupted by noise. It is observed that the Kalman filter is particularly inadequate for this type of targets in the CT and CA scenarios, causing prediction deviations. To improve this situation, an IMM filter, capable of switching between different motion dynamics, is integrated into the algorithm. Comparative test results revealed that the IMM- based approach delivers superior performance with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and high tracking accuracy against highly maneuverable drones. In the next study, the developed IMM filter will be optimized and implemented for the real applications."

    "abstract": "The economic potential of vast IoT data remains largely underutilized due to market illiquidity, which arises from a mismatch between traditional liquidity definitions and IoT data’s unique characteristics (e.g., anti-rivalrous, combinatorial, perishable). To address this, we propose the Data Asset Liquidity Index (DALI), a novel multidimensional liquidity framework for blockchain-based IoT data trading. We also introduce a decentralized trading mechanism leveraging ERC3525 Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs). This approach facilitates granular data tokenization, enabling flexible trading and reducing friction. We further enhance this mechanism with intelligent device grouping, advanced SFT merging functionalities, and a novel device package trading system, allowing for even more flexible and efficient data transactions. Through theoretical analysis and a case study, we demonstrate how SFTs enhance key DALI components, fostering a more efficient IoT data market."

However, when a signal is transmitted through the body, various types of external interference are induced, disrupting signal transmission. To improve the performance of signal transmission through the human body, on-body matching networks should be designed with consideration of the human body’s characteristics. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the values of design variables in an on-body matching network considering the human body impedance and evaluates frame synchronization performance based on the IEEE 802.15.6 preamble structure and detection algorithm. Analysis results verified that optimizing these values significantly improved communication reliability in capacitive-coupling systems."

    "abstract": "The safety of underground mine workers is of paramount importance due to the hazardous nature of their working environment. Personal protective equipment plays a crucial role in minimizing risks and ensuring workers' health and safety. However, effective assessment of Personal Protective Equipment compliance and performance is a challenging and resource-intensive task. This study explores the application of a machine learning technique to enhance Personal Protective Equipment assessment in underground mines. By utilizing computer vision, images of mine workers wearing PPE are used to customize a pre -trained yolov8n.pt model on the COCO dataset to be able to detect and classify three Personal Protective Equipment classes through model training and validation. This is done with the aim of developing a model that can determine whether PPE has been worn or not. The research employs real dataset collected from a real mine, which undergo a rigorous data wrangling process. Findings of this study indicate that the model can successfully identify helmets with high precision and recall by achieving a mean average precision of 90 %, demonstrating strong potential to replace manual inspection methods. The model's performance dropped for safety goggles and face masks with mAP values of 68 %, highlighting areas for improvement. The model also demonstrated real-time monitoring potential by processing 6.5 frames per second. Ultimately, the findings of this study highlight the potential of machine learning as a transformative tool in occupational safety management within the mining industry."

    "abstract": "In recent years, e-commerce products have become increasingly diverse, leading consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions based on previous customer experiences. One of the primary sources for such insights is customer reviews on online platforms. However, manually analyzing these reviews is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, sentiment analysis techniques have been applied to automatically analyze reviews written by customers who have purchased and used the products. These reviews are typically classified into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, helping consumers make better choices. Several studies have investigated this problem using a variety of natural language processing NLP, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to automatically analyze customer reviews. However, these studies often rely on general-purpose datasets and traditional models that fall short in capturing contextualized information of user sentiments, especially in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of several machine learning and deep learning models, including large language models (LLMs), applied to Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and LLMs such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs). The models are compared based on precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Among them, BERT achieved the best performance, with 99% accuracy and a loss of 0.03."

    "abstract": "This study examines how AI-driven personalization in Spotify Daylist, which dynamically adapts to users’ emotional states by curating music aligned with time-specific moods and microgenres, influences emotional engagement among Generation Z in Indonesia. Grounded in McCarthy’s theory of personalization and the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model, it examines how personalized content (stimuli) influences users’ emotional responses (organism), leading to various engagement (response). Motivated by previous studies that only discussed the mechanism, technical, and visual aspects of Spotify’s AI-driven playlists without examining their impact on Gen Z users, this study aims to explore whether Spotify’s AI-driven personalization new feature, Daylist, elicit emotional engagement on users, and to what extent. A quantitative approach was employed via questionnaire with Likert scale, to measure emotional engagement across various dimensions of personalization, targeting 400 Indonesian Spotify users aged 13 to 28. The collected data was analyzed using PLS-SEM to assess the structural model and explore relationships between constructs. Findings of this research successfully address the research questions and confirm the hypothesis that AI-driven personalization in Spotify Daylist significantly influences emotional engagement among Indonesian Generation Z users. Enhanced by the dynamic content layout: personalized titles, contextual descriptions, and frequently regenerated song selections tailored to specific moods and times of day, which appears to be the most influential sub-dimension. Whereas immersive experience demonstrates the strongest relationship with emotional engagement among Indonesian Generation Z users. This evolving structure fosters a sense of novelty, emotional relevance, and also makes the listening experience more enjoyable and deeply engaging for its users."
