    "abstract": "Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced."

    "abstract": "We propose a method to approximate continuous-time, continuous-state stochastic processes by a discrete-time Markov chain defined on a nonuniform grid. Our method provides exact moment matching for processes whose first and second moments are linear functions of time. In particular, we show that, under certain conditions, the transition probabilities of a Markov chain can be chosen so that its first two moments match prescribed linear functions of time. These conditions depend on the grid points of the Markov chain and the coefficients of the linear mean and variance functions. Our proof relies on two recurrence relations for the expectation and variance across time. This approach enables simulation-based numerical analysis of continuous processes while preserving their key characteristics. We illustrate its efficacy by approximating continuous processes describing heat diffusion and geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For heat diffusion, we show that the heat profile at a set of points can be investigated by embedding those points inside the nonuniform grid of our Markov chain. For GBM, numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach, combined with suitable nonuniform grids, yields accurate approximations, with consistently small empirical Wasserstein-1 distances at long time horizons."

    "abstract": "Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature."

Here, we focus on an alternative strategy: transforming $H$ into a Hermitian form via the Dyson map $Ω: H \\to \\mathfrak{h}$. This construction of the Hermitian isospectral twin $\\mathfrak{h}$ of $H$ does not only restore the conventional correspondence principle between quantum and classical physics, but it also provides a framework for the exhaustive classification of all admissible probabilistic interpretations of quantum systems in QHQM framework."

In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\\,\\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions."

Precise calibration of the WFS's EMCCD detector is essential to meet the stringent requirements for high-contrast exoplanet imaging. This study comprehensively characterizes key performance parameters of the detector to ensure its suitability for astronomical observations. Through a multi-stage screening protocol, we identified an EMCCD chip exhibiting high resolution and low noise. The electron-multiplying gain (EM Gain) of the EMCCD was analyzed to determine its impact on signal amplification and noise characteristics, identifying the optimal operational range. Additionally, noise properties such as readout noise were investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized detector meets CPI-C's initial application requirements, achieving high resolution and low noise. This study provides theoretical and experimental foundations for the use of EMCCD-based WFS in adaptive optics and astronomical observations, ensuring their reliability for advanced space-based imaging applications"

    "abstract": "The problem of subgraph counting asks for the number of occurrences of a pattern graph $H$ as a subgraph of a host graph $G$ and is known to be computationally challenging: it is $\\#W[1]$-hard even when $H$ is restricted to simple structures such as cliques or paths. Curticapean and Marx (FOCS'14) show that if the graph $H$ has vertex cover number $τ$, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(|H|^{2^{O(τ)}} |G|^{τ+ O(1)})$. This raises the question of whether this upper bound can be improved for input graphs $G$ from a restricted family of graphs. Earlier work by Eppstein~(IPL'94) shows that this is indeed possible, by proving that when $G$ is a $d$-degenerate graph and $H$ is a biclique of arbitrary size, subgraph counting has time complexity $O(d 3^{d/3} |G|)$. We show that if the input is restricted to $d$-degenerate graphs, the upper bound of Curticapean and Marx can be improved for a family of graphs $H$ that includes all bicliques and satisfies a property we call $(c,d)$-locatable. Importantly, our algorithm's running time only has a polynomial dependence on the size of~$H$. A key feature of $(c,d)$-locatable graphs $H$ is that they admit a vertex cover of size at most $cd$. We further characterize $(1,d)$-locatable graphs, for which our algorithms achieve a linear running time dependence on $|G|$, and we establish a lower bound showing that counting graphs which are barely not $(1,d)$-locatable is already $\\#\\text{W}[1]$-hard. We note that the restriction to $d$-degenerate graphs has been a fruitful line of research leading to two very general results (FOCS'21, SODA'25) and this creates the impression that we largely understand the complexity of counting substructures in degenerate graphs. However, all aforementioned results have an exponential dependency on the size of the pattern graph $H$."

In this model, $d = n^{Ω(1)}$ cliques of size approximately $k$ are randomly planted by choosing the vertices to participate in each clique independently with probability $δ$. While there has been extensive work on recovering one, or multiple disjointly planted cliques in random graphs, the natural extension of this question to recovering overlapping cliques has been, surprisingly, largely unexplored. Moreover, because every vertex can be part of polynomially many cliques, this task is significantly harder than in case of disjointly planted cliques (as recently studied by Kothari, Vempala, Wein and Xu [COLT'23]) and manifests in the failure of simple combinatorial and even spectral algorithms. In this work we obtain the first efficient algorithms for recovering the community structure of RIGs both from the perspective of exact and approximate recovery. Our algorithms are further robust to noise, monotone adversaries, a certain, optimal number of edge corruptions, and work whenever $k \\gg \\sqrt{n \\log(n)}$. Our techniques follow the proofs-to-algorithms framework utilizing the sum-of-squares hierarchy."

We further uncover a duality connection with mirror descent, and use it to establish that the flow of interest solves an infinite-horizon optimal-control problem of which the value function is the Bregman divergence generated by the cost.

This paper introduces a unified framework for generalized block signal transmission in LPWANs, addressing the limitations of conventional symbol-by-symbol approaches. The framework comprises three key components: the signal block vector, the intra-block structure generator, and the signal basis matrix, and leverages quasi-orthogonal codewords formed through cyclically shifted spreading sequences. The resulting quasi-orthogonality enables reliable multi-user separation, particularly under asynchronous access. The framework establishes a conceptual foundation for block synchronization and provides a unified demodulation structure based on block correlation matching. It further supports flexible and systematic implementation, as demonstrated through applications to frequency-shift keying and chirp spread spectrum. This work advances scalable and efficient physical-layer design for next-generation LPWANs."

We observe robust, reversible U-shaped conductance variations with interelectrode distance. Ab-initio electronic structure and quantum transport calculations reveal that this behavior stems from destructive quantum interference, induced mainly by modifications of the coupling at the metal-molecule interface as a peculiar outcome of the helical backbone deformation. These findings highlight the central role of the helical geometry in combination with contact properties in the electromechanical response of conducting molecular springs, offering insights for designing functional electromechanical devices that leverage similar mechanisms."

Unlike Gd, Mn is an endogenous paramagnetic metal with known biochemical pathways in the human body for excretion and metal regulation, which may alleviate the raised concerns about the safety of existing GBCAs. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, kinetics and image enhancement properties of a class of novel Mn-based macrocyclic chelates in a porcine model. Methods: Macrocyclic MBCAs, AH114608, GEH300017 and GEH200486, were tested and compared to gadoterate meglumine. Twelve female adult pigs were divided into four groups (n=3 for each CA). At 3 T MRI, T1 relaxometry analysis were measured longitudinally in multiple organs at five timepoints 30 minutes apart. CA kinetics was estimated from analysis of plasma CA concentrations by ICP-OES. Results: All four CAs exhibited T1-enhancing properties in the blood pool with GEH200486 having the largest increase in T1 relaxation rate (R1), GEH300017 and gadoterate meglumine having similar R1 increase and AH114608 a lower peak R1 change. A persistent increase in liver, kidney and myocardium R1 was observed with AH114608. To a lesser extent, a persistent increase of liver enhancement was also observed in T1-weighted images for GEH300017 and GEH200486 compared to gadoterate meglumine. All four CAs had similar bi-exponential plasma kinetics characterized by a rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination phase. Discussion: We have identified MBCA candidates with predominantly renal clearance and comparable efficacy in terms of vascular T1 relaxation, and comparable to the reference GBCA. The T1-enhancing properties of these novel Mn macrocyclic CAs can be used with routine clinical protocols and could be potentially utilised as an alternative to GBCAs for contrast-enhanced MRI procedures."

By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing."

    "abstract": "Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition."

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs."

Built on the LEMUR dataset as an audited corpus with reproducible metrics, NNGPT emits from a single prompt and validates network architecture, preprocessing code, and hyperparameters, executes them end-to-end, and learns from result. The PyTorch adapter makes NNGPT framework-agnostic, enabling strong performance: NN-RAG achieves 73% executability on 1,289 targets, 3-shot prompting boosts accuracy on common datasets, and hash-based deduplication saves hundreds of runs. One-shot prediction matches search-based AutoML, reducing the need for numerous trials. HPO on LEMUR achieves RMSE 0.60, outperforming Optuna (0.64), while the code-aware predictor reaches RMSE 0.14 with Pearson r=0.78. The system has already generated over 5K validated models, proving NNGPT as an autonomous AutoML engine. Upon acceptance, the code, prompts, and checkpoints will be released for public access to enable reproducibility and facilitate community usage."

    "abstract": "Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance."

We show how the optimizations that need to be carried out in order to implement active inference in discrete state spaces can be formulated as constrained divergence minimization problems which can be solved by standard mean field methods that do not appeal to the idea of expected free energy. When it is used to model perception, the perception/action divergence criterion that we propose coincides with variational free energy. When it is used to model action, it differs from an expected free energy functional by an entropy regularizer."

We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models."

    "abstract": "The human brain, with its energy-efficient and massively parallel architecture seamlessly integrates memory and computation. Its topology and functionality serve as the inspiration for the field of neuromorphic computing. Realizing brain-like hardware requires the integration of fundamental properties such as synaptic plasticity, self-organization, hierarchical and modular structures, as well as three-dimensional connectivity. Current challenges lie in developing liquid based neuromorphic material systems with facile fabrication, three-dimensional processing, and brain-like conductivity. This work presents ionotronic systems - i.e., systems that incorporate the movement of both electrons and ions - to obtain dynamically reconfigurable conductive filaments. Our method employs an electrolyte where an anode reservoir produces ions in-situ, enabling electrode-dependent tunability and sustained operation without ion depletion. This manuscript presents four ionotronic systems. Each system grows brain inspired three-dimensional wires contacting two or more electrodes exhibiting resistive switching at connection on a micrometer scale as well as a nanometer scale, demonstrating hierarchical organization and functionality. Furthermore, these conducting filaments are capable of being disrupted by an external electric field or dissolved over time in the ionotronic system, emulating blooming and pruning aspects of plasticity."

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is commonly attributed to non-thermal radiation processes operating in the optically thin regions of a relativistic outflow. Among these, optically thin inverse-Compton (IC) scattering remains an important yet under-tested mechanism. From an initial set of 41 bursts selected using empirical Band-function criteria that highlight quasi-thermal low-energy slopes ($α> -0.5$) and constrained high-energy indices ($-1.7 > β> -3.3$), only four events satisfy these conditions consistently in both time-integrated and time-resolved spectra. The IC fits yield self-consistent constraints on the seed-photon field and the electron population at the dissipation site. For bulk Lorentz factors $Γ\\sim 170$-$550$, we infer seed thermal peaks of $\\sim 0.05$-$0.2$ keV and electron thermal energies of $\\sim 20$-$300$ keV in the co-moving frame. A fraction of only $0.1\\%$-$20\\%$ of electrons are accelerated into a non-thermal tail with an average index value of $δ\\sim 1.8$. The derived Comptonisation parameters indicate moderate $y$ values ($\\sim 1$-$3$), optical depths $τ\\sim 0.2$-$0.6$, and dissipation radii just above the photosphere, consistent with mildly relativistic ($γ_{\\min} \\sim 1.2$-$2.6$), photon-dominated, low-magnetic-field dissipation environments. Furthermore, the framework allows us to constrain even sub-dominant thermal components that lie below the detector's low-energy threshold. Taken together, our results show that optically thin IC scattering offers a physically consistent and observationally viable explanation for the prompt emission in a subset of bright GRBs, motivating the application of IC models in future GRB studies."

However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation.

We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\\rm gas}^{\\rm bound}$), $M_{\\rm core}^{\\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales."

The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case."

Here we show that exciton-magnon coupling provides an optical gateway to dark excitons in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor CrSBr. Broadband femtosecond reflectivity reveals a dark exciton at 1.46 eV that is entirely absent in static optical spectra but becomes visible through its coherent hybridization with a GHz magnon. High-photon-energy excitation further allows active control of the hybrid dispersion, enabling strong renormalization and selective enhancement of exciton-magnon interactions. These results establish a general mechanism by which magnetic order renders dark excitons optically addressable, opening a pathway toward engineered hybrid spin-exciton platforms for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction."

While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models."

    "abstract": "A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released."

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an enriched Galerkin (EG) finite element method for the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The method augments continuous piecewise linear velocity spaces with elementwise bubble functions, yielding a locally conservative velocity approximation while retaining the efficiency of low-order continuous elements. The viscous term is discretized using a symmetric interior penalty formulation, and the divergence constraint is imposed through a stable pressure space. To enhance the robustness of the velocity approximation with respect to the pressure, a reconstruction operator is introduced in the convective and coupling terms, resulting in a pressure-robust scheme whose accuracy does not deteriorate for small viscosities. Both Picard and Newton linearizations are formulated in a fully discrete manner, and the corresponding linear systems are assembled efficiently at each iteration. Optimal a~priori error estimates are established for the velocity in the mesh-dependent energy norm and for the pressure in the $L^2$ norm. Two representative numerical experiments are presented: a smooth manufactured solution and the lid-driven cavity flow. The numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence rates, demonstrating first-order convergence of the velocity in the energy norm, second-order convergence in the $L^2$ norm, and first-order convergence of the pressure. The proposed EG scheme accurately captures characteristic flow structures, illustrating its effectiveness and robustness for incompressible flow simulation."

It is called quasi-Frobenius if, in addition, is a Lie superalgebra and the form is closed. We introduce the Levi-Civita product associated with pre-symplectic superalgebras and establish its existence and uniqueness. We then introduce the symplectic product associated with quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebras. We prove that while such a product always exists, it is not unique. We therefore define a natural symplectic product that depends only on the Lie structure and the bilinear form. When the curvature of this product vanishes, the superalgebra is called a flat quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebra. In this paper, we study flat quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebras and introduce the notion of a flat double extension. We prove that the double extension process characterizes such superalgebras. More precisely, every flat orthosymplectic (resp. periplectic) quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebra can be obtained by a sequence of flat double extensions starting from an abelian one (resp. the trivial one). Moreover, we show that every flat quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebra is nilpotent with a degenerate center.

    "abstract": "Duo-Tok is a source-aware dual-codebook tokenizer for vocal-accompaniment music that targets the growing tension between reconstruction quality and language-model (LM) learnability in modern lyrics-to-song systems. Existing codecs either prioritize high-fidelity reconstruction with difficult-to-model acoustic tokens or compress aggressively into semantic tokens that are LM-friendly but lossy, and they rarely make the tokenizer itself aware of dual-track structure. Duo-Tok follows a four-stage, SSL-centered pipeline: we first pretrain a BEST-RQ-style encoder on large-scale audio, then stabilize and factorize the representation with Gaussian replacement noise and multi-task supervision, before freezing the encoder to learn SimVQ-based dual codebooks with hard routing for vocals and accompaniment, and finally training latent diffusion decoders on top of the discrete tokens. Duo-Tok at 0.75 kbps shifts the empirical reconstruction-generation Pareto frontier, achieving the best music-tagging AP and the lowest vocabulary-normalized LM perplexity among compared codecs while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to state-of-the-art music tokenizers."

    "abstract": "Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images."

In two-dimensions, as a consequence of four-color theorem in mathematics, there is a change in topological constraints for $N = 3$ and $N \\ge 4$ components. This leads to a suppression of hydrodynamics effects and we show that the diffusion-dominated coarsening dynamics for $N \\ge 4$ can be collapsed to a single master curve. The behavior extends to thin three-dimensional systems as the fluid domain size reaches the smallest system dimension. However, by varying the fluid interfacial tensions, cloaking may occur, resulting in highly complex coarsening dynamics that can differ for each component. In full three-dimensional cases, the absence of four-color theorem (or its equivalent) means that the diffusive scaling law is only reached asymptotically for large $N$ rather than at a certain critical $N$."

Focusing on Max-Cut, we first show that for general graphs and any fixed round $p\\ge2$, exactly evaluating the expectation of fixed-round QAOA at prescribed angles is $\\mathrm{NP}$-hard, and that approximating this expectation within additive error $2^{-O(n)}$ in the number $n$ of vertices is already $\\mathrm{NP}$-hard. To evaluate the expected performance of QAOA, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm leveraging tree decomposition. As a byproduct, when the $p$-local treewidth grows at most logarithmically with the number of vertices, this yields a polynomial-time \\emph{exact} evaluation algorithm in the graph size $n$. Beyond Max-Cut, we extend the framework to general Binary Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization (BUCO). Finally, we provide reproducible evaluations for rounds up to $p=3$ on representative structured families, including the generalized Petersen graph $GP(15,2)$, double-layer triangular 2-lifts, and the truncated icosahedron graph $C_{60}$, and report cut ratios while benchmarking against locality-matched classical baselines."

Ce3+ and Mg2+ doped Lu2.5Gd0.5Ga2Al3O12 powders were prepared by using UV irradiation of aqueous solutions with low-pressure mercury lamps and subsequent calcination of the solid products. The synthesis was optimized and gives access to a range of doping which is very hard to achieve with single crystal growth from melt. The effect of Ce and Mg concentration on the structural and luminescence properties was studied. Garnets were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and their luminescence properties under optical and X-ray photon excitations were investigated. XRF and XRD show that the samples are sufficiently chemically pure and phase-pure and their elemental composition corresponds with expectations. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy confirmed that Mg concentrations in Mg-codoped samples are slightly lower than the nominal. Luminescence spectra show typical emission maxima of 5d-4f Ce3+ transition and 4f-4f Gd3+ transition. The effects of the concentration of Ce3+ and Mg2+ on the RL intensity, light yields and decays were observed."

Together with manually refined prompts, this design improves tool call stability, execution reliability, and role-playing guidance. Second, in the GPU Track, we further adopt GRPO training, replacing supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning directly optimized by reward signals. This mitigates small-sample overfitting and significantly enhances task-oriented dialogue performance. In the final evaluation, our team ranks 1st in Task 2 API, 2nd in Task 1 API, and 3rd in both Task 3 API and GPU track, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Generalized Matrix Chains (GMCs) are products of matrices where each matrix carries features (e.g., general, symmetric, triangular, positive-definite) and is optionally transposed and/or inverted. GMCs are commonly evaluated via sequences of calls to BLAS and LAPACK kernels. When matrix sizes are known, one can craft a sequence of kernel calls to evaluate a GMC that minimizes some cost, e.g., the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). Even in these circumstances, high-level languages and libraries, upon which users usually rely, typically perform a suboptimal mapping of the input GMC onto a sequence of kernels. In this work, we go one step beyond and consider matrix sizes to be symbolic (unknown); this changes the nature of the problem since no single sequence of kernel calls is optimal for all possible combinations of matrix sizes. We design and evaluate a code generator for GMCs with symbolic sizes that relies on multi-versioning. At compile-time, when the GMC is known but the sizes are not, code is generated for a few carefully selected sequences of kernel calls. At run-time, when sizes become known, the best generated variant for the matrix sizes at hand is selected and executed. The code generator uses new theoretical results that guarantee that the cost is within a constant factor from optimal for all matrix sizes and an empirical tuning component that further tightens the gap to optimality in practice. In experiments, we found that the increase above optimal in both FLOPs and execution time of the generated code was less than 15\\% for 95\\% of the tested chains."

    "abstract": "Under high pressure, the group-VB transition metals vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb) exhibit simple crystal structures but complex physical behaviors, such as anomalous compression-induced softening and heating-induced hardening (CISHIH). Meanwhile, the impact of lattice thermal expansion-induced softening at elevated temperatures on HIH is yet to be investigated. Therefore, this study utilized ab initio (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) to investigate the melting and abnormal mechanical softening-hardening behaviors of V and Nb under high pressure. Simulations reveal that the high-temperature Pnma phase of Nb reported in previous experimental studies is highly susceptible to mechanical instability and reverts to the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. This discovery prompted a revised determination of the high-pressure melting line of Nb. The melting temperature of Nb significantly exceeds the existing theoretical and experimental estimate compared with that of V. AIMD simulations demonstrate that atomic thermal displacements have a greater influence on the HIH of V and Nb than pure electron temperature effects. In addition, the temperature-dependent anomalous elastic properties of V and Nb were investigated within a pressure range of 0-250 GPa using MLMD. The mechanical properties of V and Nb transitioned from HIH to heating-induced softening, elucidating the competition between thermal-expansion-induced softening and HIH. This study advances fundamental understanding of V and Nb physics, providing crucial theoretical foundations for establishing accurate equations of state and constitutive models for these metals."

Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers.

    "abstract": "Discovering subgroups with the maximum average treatment effect is crucial for targeted decision making in domains such as precision medicine, public policy, and education. While most prior work is formulated in the potential outcome framework, the corresponding structural causal model (SCM) for this task has been largely overlooked. In practice, two approaches dominate. The first estimates pointwise conditional treatment effects and then fits a tree on those estimates, effectively turning subgroup estimation into the harder problem of accurate pointwise estimation. The second constructs decision trees or rule sets with ad-hoc 'causal' heuristics, typically without rigorous justification for why a given heuristic may be used or whether such heuristics are necessary at all. We address these issues by studying the problem directly under the SCM framework. Under the assumption of a partition-based model, we show that optimal subgroup discovery reduces to recovering the data-generating models and hence a standard supervised learning problem (regression or classification). This allows us to adopt any partition-based methods to learn the subgroup from data. We instantiate the approach with CART, arguably one of the most widely used tree-based methods, to learn the subgroup with maximum treatment effect. Finally, on a large collection of synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we compare our method against a wide range of baselines and find that our approach, which avoids such causal heuristics, more accurately identifies subgroups with maximum treatment effect.

Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field. The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures."

We show that in dimension greater than 2, its symbol determines the Taylor series of the metric and connection modulo gauge on the boundary when $m \\neq 0$ and $m^2$ is not in the Dirichlet spectrum of $D_A^2$. We go on to show that a real-analytic Riemannian manifold and twisted spinor bundle with twisted spin connection can be recovered from its boundary conjugation map.

Similar results hold in dimension $2$ when the auxiliary bundle and connection are absent."

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis remains a challenging task due to the inherent heterogeneity across modalities. Such heterogeneity often manifests as asynchronous signals, imbalanced information between modalities, and interference from task-irrelevant noise, hindering the learning of robust and accurate sentiment representations. To address these issues, we propose a factorized multimodal fusion framework that first disentangles each modality into shared and unique representations, and then suppresses task-irrelevant noise within both to retain only sentiment-critical representations. This fine-grained decomposition improves representation quality by reducing redundancy, prompting cross-modal complementarity, and isolating task-relevant sentiment cues. Rather than manipulating the feature space directly, we adopt a mutual information-based optimization strategy to guide the factorization process in a more stable and principled manner. To further support feature extraction and long-term temporal modeling, we introduce two auxiliary modules: a Mixture of Q-Formers, placed before factorization, which precedes the factorization and uses learnable queries to extract fine-grained affective features from multiple modalities, and a Dynamic Contrastive Queue, placed after factorization, which stores latest high-level representations for contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture long-range discriminative patterns and improve class-level separability. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework."

In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is fundamental for efficient link adaptation. However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE)."

In particular, we show that the volume-constraint for the finite-ratio problem disappears in the limit. This leads to a volume-unconstrained Dirichlet-forced evolution, a setting where monotonicity, uniqueness, and contact line regularity properties have been established in previous literature. Our result is based on using comparison principle techniques for the prescribed mean curvature equation with capillary contact angle condition that characterizes the liquid surface at equilibrium. Through barrier arguments, we are able to develop asymptotics for the energy which give us control independent of the container-to-plate ratio."

This paper introduces a scalable, robust, and efficient algorithm to deal with 2D and 3D elastostatics contact problems between deformable bodies in a finite element framework. The proposed solution combines a treatment of the contact problem by a node-to-node pairing algorithm with a penalization technique and a non-conforming h-adaptive refinement of quadrilateral/hexahedral meshes based on an estimate-mark-refine approach in a parallel framework. One of the special features of our parallel strategy is that contact paired nodes are hosted by the same MPI tasks, which reduces the number of exchanges between processes for building the contact operator. The mesh partitioning introduced in this paper respects this rule and is based on an equidistribution of elements over processes, without any other constraints. In order to preserve the domain curvature while hierarchical mesh refinement, super-parametric elements are used. This functionality enables the contact zone to be well detected during the AMR process, even for an initial coarse mesh and low-order discretization schemes. The efficiency of our contact-AMR-HPC strategy is assessed on 2D and 3D Hertzian contact problems. Different AMR detection criteria are considered. Various convergence analyses are conducted. Parallel performances up to 1024 cores are illustrated. Furthermore, memory footprint and preconditionners performance are analyzed."

    "abstract": "Crystal nucleation studies using hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones models have shown that the pressure within the nucleus is lower than that in the surrounding liquid. Here, we use the mechanical route to obtain it for an ice nucleus in supercooled water (TIP4P/Ice) at 1 bar and 247 K. From this (mechanical) pressure, we obtain the interfacial stress using a thermodynamic definition consistent with mechanical arguments. This pressure is compared with that of bulk ice at equal chemical potential (thermodynamic pressure), and the interfacial stress with the interfacial free energy. Furthermore, we investigate these properties on the basal plane. We find that, unlike in hard-sphere and Lennard-Jones systems, mechanical and thermodynamic pressures agree for the nucleus, and the interfacial stress and free energy are comparable. Yet the basal interface displays an interfacial stress nearly twice its interfacial free energy, suggesting that this agreement may be system dependent, underscoring the limitations of mechanical routes to solid-liquid interfacial free energies."

    "abstract": "Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation. The framework offers a simple, data-efficient, and fully open-source solution that provides an extensible foundation for future research in longitudinal and multimodal lung cancer risk prediction."

    "abstract": "For digital over-the-air computation, the ChannelComp framework has recently been proposed to design digital modulations to compute any arbitrary function over a multiple access channel. To reduce modulation design complexity while increasing computation reliability, this paper integrates a bit-partitioning procedure into ChannelComp. The key process is to partition the input bit sequence into several groups, map each group to a single modulation symbol and transmit the encoded symbol sequence across multiple time slots. With the objective to maximize a worst-case constellation distance, we develop two bit-partitioning methods. In uniform bit-partitioning, bits are evenly distributed across groups and modulation is designed via a max-min optimization, which is handled by a CCCP that solves a sequence of second-order cone programming subproblems. In importance-adaptive bit-partitioning (IABP), the bit allocation is adapted to the significance of individual bit positions, and the modulation and partitioning are jointly optimized. To keep the overall complexity manageable, simulated annealing is employed in the outer loop to update the partitioning, while a CCCP-based solver is used in the inner loop for modulation design. Numerical results show that both methods provide robust computation in noisy channels, and IABP achieves up to a 5 dB reduction in computation error compared to Sequential Modulation for AirComp, especially for product computation."

    "abstract": "The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability."

To bridge this gap, we introduce Core Refined Understanding eXpression (CRUX), a structured intermediate space that captures the essential semantics of user intent while organizing the expression for precise Verilog code generation. We further design a two-stage training framework, comprising Joint Expression Modeling and Dual-Space Optimization, to enhance the quality of both CRUX and Verilog code. Experiments across multiple Verilog generation benchmarks demonstrate that our model, CRUX-V, achieves state-of-the-art performance among general models, particularly under challenging design tasks. Furthermore, the CRUX space proves transferable and beneficial when used as input prompts for other code models, highlighting its effectiveness in narrowing the gap between free-form natural language descriptions and precise Verilog generation."

We present the precise measurement of the CPT-sensitive angular correlation entailing the positronium spin and the momenta of its annihilation photons, surpassing previous studies utilizing the same detection system. Positrons originating from a $^{22}$Na source are emitted from the detector's center and subsequently form positronium atoms within the spherical chamber covered with porous material. Reconstruction of annihilation locations using the 192-strip J-PET detector makes it possible to determine the positronium emission direction, which defines the quantization axis along which positronium is polarized, without the application of external magnetic fields. The measurements were performed in total for 356 days resulting in an identification of 47.8 million events with ortho-positronium decays into three photons. The results are consistent with the exactness of CPT symmetry with measured asymmetry amplitude -0.00029 $\\pm$ 0.00022 (stat.) and with statistical error four times smaller than the previous best measurement."

To analyze these challenges, we propose a nine-dimensional taxonomy of digital afterlife technologies and, building on it, outline the features of an ethically acceptable digital ghost: premortem intent, mutual consent, transparent and limited data use, clear disclosure, restricted purposes and access, family or estate stewardship, and minimal behavioral agency. We argue for targeted regulation and professional guidelines to ensure that digital ghosts can aid remembrance without slipping into forms of deception."

However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform."

    "abstract": "Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks."

Empirical evidence suggests that both the marginal and dependence structures for extreme precipitation in the area exhibit seasonal patterns, and spatial dependence appears to weaken as events become more extreme. We investigate factors affecting the marginal distributions, the spatial dependence and the interplay between them. Capturing these features is essential to provide a realistic description of extreme precipitation processes in order to better estimate their associated risks. With this aim, we identify various climatic covariates at different spatio-temporal scales and explore their usefulness. We go beyond existing literature by investigating and comparing the performance of recently proposed covariate-dependent models for both the marginal and dependence structures of extremes. Furthermore, a flexible max-id model, which encompasses both asymptotic dependence and independence, is used to learn about the spatio-temporal variability of rainfall processes at extreme levels. We find that modelling non-stationarity only at the marginal level does not fully capture the variability of precipitation extremes, and that it is important to also capture the seasonal variation of extremal dependence."

On-device searches, such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search and radius search, are commonly used to enable fast analytics and learning technologies, such as k-means dataset simplification using kNN. To maintain high search efficiency, a representative approach is to utilize a balanced multi-way KD-tree (BMKD-tree). However, the index has shown limited gains, mainly due to substantial construction overhead, inflexibility to real-time insertion, and inconsistent query performance. In this paper, we propose UnIS to address the above limitations. We first accelerate the construction process of the BMKD-tree by utilizing the dataset distribution to predict the splitting hyperplanes. To make the continuously generated data searchable, we propose a selective sub-tree rebuilding scheme to accelerate rebalancing during insertion by reducing the number of data points involved. We then propose an auto-selection model to improve query performance by automatically selecting the optimal search strategy among multiple strategies for an arbitrary query task. Experimental results show that UnIS achieves average speedups of 17.96x in index construction, 1.60x in insertion, 7.15x in kNN search, and 1.09x in radius search compared to the BMKD-tree. We further verify its effectiveness in accelerating dataset simplification on edge devices, achieving a speedup of 217x over Lloyd's algorithm."

Events are required to feature an energetic jet, large missing transverse momentum, and at least one low-momentum charged particle that serves as a candidate higgsino decay product. In the first search, targeting higgsino mass splittings in the range of 0.3-1 GeV, the higgsinos are expected to predominantly decay into pions that are identified as low-momentum charged particles with large transverse impact parameters due to the long higgsino lifetime ($cτ\\approx\\mathcal{O}$(0.1-1 mm)). The second search targets larger mass splittings in the range of 1-3 GeV, where the higgsinos are expected to decay promptly into low-momentum leptons, one of which is identified by dedicated low-momentum electron or muon taggers based on neural networks utilising tracking and calorimeter information. No significant excess above the Standard Model prediction is observed in either search and the results are used to set lower limits on the masses of the higgsino-like charginos and neutralinos within a simplified model. Together, these searches exclude chargino masses below 126 GeV at 95% confidence level for mass splittings between the chargino and lightest neutralino in the range of 0.3-2 GeV, representing the first ATLAS constraints in this parameter space and surpassing the limits previously set by the LEP experiments."

While most research on aesthetic bias has examined it in the context of current societal issues, it is also crucial for historical representation, particularly of sensitive subjects such as historical atrocities. To address this gap, we conduct a comparative audit of the visual representation of Holocaust victims on Google. We find that Google tends to propagate a male-dominated representation of Holocaust victims with an emphasis on atrocity context, risking rendering invisible gender-specific suffering and decreasing potential for nurturing empathy.

    "abstract": "Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous \"split-then-balance\" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard (\"Social Media Screener\") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health."

    "abstract": "Creativity is a complex phenomenon. When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \\emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes,\" geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation."

    "abstract": "Fault tolerance is widely regarded as indispensable for achieving scalable and reliable quantum computing. However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\\varphi|\\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications. Compared to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation and magic state cultivation approaches, our method reduces spacetime resource costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6, respectively, for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation task under realistic hardware assumptions."

However, increasing their complexity often fails to substantially improve their accuracy, leaving them on par with much simpler approaches such as kernel methods and more traditional reduced-order models. In this article, we set out to address this shortcoming and introduce CHONKNORIS (Cholesky Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), an operator learning paradigm that can achieve machine precision. CHONKNORIS draws on numerical analysis: many nonlinear forward and inverse PDE problems are solvable by Newton-type methods. Rather than regressing the solution operator itself, our method regresses the Cholesky factors of the elliptic operator associated with Tikhonov-regularized Newton--Kantorovich updates. The resulting unrolled iteration yields a neural architecture whose machine-precision behavior follows from achieving a contractive map, requiring far lower accuracy than end-to-end approximation of the solution operator. We benchmark CHONKNORIS on a range of nonlinear forward and inverse problems, including a nonlinear elliptic equation, Burgers' equation, a nonlinear Darcy flow problem, the Calderón problem, an inverse wave scattering problem, and a problem from seismic imaging. We also present theoretical guarantees for the convergence of CHONKNORIS in terms of the accuracy of the emulated Cholesky factors. Additionally, we introduce a foundation model variant, FONKNORIS (Foundation Newton--Kantorovich Neural Operator Residual Iterative System), which aggregates multiple pre-trained CHONKNORIS experts for diverse PDEs to emulate the solution map of a novel nonlinear PDE. Our FONKNORIS model is able to accurately solve unseen nonlinear PDEs such as the Klein--Gordon and Sine--Gordon equations."

It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads."

    "abstract": "Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach to incentivizing reasoning capability in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), while the underlying mechanisms behind this post-training paradigm are poorly understood. We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation.

HSTAN employs a decoupled architecture (Graph Attention Network for spatial, cascaded GRU with self-attention for temporal) to achieve superior performance and efficiency, requiring only 12.3 ms inference time (73% faster than Transformer methods) and reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) to 0.73m (42.2% better than Social_LSTM) on the NGSIM dataset. Furthermore, Conformalized Quantile Regression enhances reliability by generating prediction intervals (91.3% coverage at 90% confidence), which the DTRA module then converts into timely warnings via a physics-informed risk potential function and an adaptive threshold mechanism inspired by statistical process control.Tested across multi-scenario datasets, the complete system demonstrates high efficacy, achieving an F1 score of 0.912, a low false alarm rate of 8.2%, and an ample warning lead time of 2.8 seconds, validating the framework's superior performance and practical deployment feasibility in complex environments."

We show that particle size, volume fraction, and orientation of the hard phase can effectively control the transition from collinear to non-collinear coupling, with a critical exchange size r_cr approximately 12 nm. Increasing the hard-phase fraction deepens the anisotropy energy well and monotonically suppresses permeability. In contrast, rotating the BaM easy axis to 90 degrees relative to the applied field produces a strong enhancement: at a 10 nm radius and eta = 0.1 volume fraction, the effective permeability can be more than 30 times larger than in the parallel configuration and then saturates for larger particles. This study establishes a microstructure-permeability-based physical framework for designing hard/soft magnetic composite systems."

    "abstract": "Universal online learning aims to achieve optimal regret guarantees without requiring prior knowledge of the curvature of online functions. Existing methods have established minimax-optimal regret bounds for universal online learning, where a single algorithm can simultaneously attain $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for convex functions, $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log T)$ for exp-concave functions, and $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ for strongly convex functions, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $d$ is the dimension of the feasible domain. However, these methods still lack problem-dependent adaptivity. In particular, no universal method provides regret bounds that scale with the gradient variation $V_T$, a key quantity that plays a crucial role in applications such as stochastic optimization and fast-rate convergence in games. In this work, we introduce UniGrad, a novel approach that achieves both universality and adaptivity, with two distinct realizations: UniGrad.Correct and UniGrad.Bregman. Both methods achieve universal regret guarantees that adapt to gradient variation, simultaneously attaining $\\mathcal{O}(\\log V_T)$ regret for strongly convex functions and $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log V_T)$ regret for exp-concave functions. For convex functions, the regret bounds differ: UniGrad.Correct achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{V_T \\log V_T})$ bound while preserving the RVU property that is crucial for fast convergence in online games, whereas UniGrad.Bregman achieves the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{V_T})$ regret bound through a novel design. Both methods employ a meta algorithm with $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ base learners, which naturally requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ gradient queries per round.

    "abstract": "One-stream Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated remarkable performance by concatenating template and search region tokens, thereby enabling joint attention across all tokens. However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens. The proposed CPDATrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly on GOT-10k, where it attains an average overlap of 75.1 percent."

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time."

This study investigates the PINN loss landscape to identify the failure mechanisms of two primary formulations: the high-order strong formulation and the energy-based formulation. The results demonstrate that the Strong Formulation suffers from landscape ill-conditioning driven by the boundary conditions (BCs), leading to convergence issues in the doubly-clamped case. Conversely, while the energy-based formulation requires only lower-order derivatives, its loss functional can become indefinite, causing optimization difficulties near saddle points. Based on strain field benchmarks against Finite Element Method (FEM), it is found that the strong formulation, combined with a BC handling method and the L-BFGS optimizer, yields the best performance across three classical boundary condition cases. These findings clarify distinct, formulation-dependent failure modes, offering a diagnostic foundation for developing robust physics-based surrogate models for complex beam systems."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, a variety of fine-tuning methods have been developed, enabling high-fidelity image generation with high similarity to the target content using only 3 to 5 training images. More recently, zero-shot generation methods have emerged, capable of producing highly realistic outputs from a single reference image without altering model weights. However, technological advancements have also introduced significant risks to facial privacy. Malicious actors can exploit diffusion model customization with just a few or even one image of a person to create synthetic identities nearly identical to the original identity. Although research has begun to focus on defending against diffusion model customization, most existing defense methods target fine-tuning approaches and neglect zero-shot generation defenses. To address this issue, this paper proposes Dual-Layer Anti-Diffusion (DLADiff) to defense both fine-tuning methods and zero-shot methods. DLADiff contains a dual-layer protective mechanism. The first layer provides effective protection against unauthorized fine-tuning by leveraging the proposed Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) mechanism and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT), which integrates adversarial training with the prior knowledge derived from pre-fine-tuned models. The second layer, though simple in design, demonstrates strong effectiveness in preventing image generation through zero-shot methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning of diffusion models and achieves unprecedented performance in protecting against zero-shot generation."

However, a long-standing challenge in this large-scale brain network analysis is how to compare network organizations irrespective of their complexity. The maximum spanning tree (MST) has served as a simple, unbiased, standardized representation of complex brain networks and effectively addressed this long-standing challenge. This tree representation, however, has been limited to individual networks. Group-level trees are always constructed from the average network or through a bootstrap procedure. Constructing the group-level tree from the average network introduces bias from individual subjects with outlying connectivities. The bootstrap method can be computationally prohibitive if a good approximation is desired. To address these issues, we propose a novel spectral representation of trees using the spanning tree basis. This spectral representation enables us to compute the average MST and demonstrate that this average tree captures the global properties of all the MSTs in the group and also overlaps with the union of the shortest paths in the functional brain networks."

    "abstract": "Phase-Based Ranging (PBR) offers several advantages for estimating distances between wirelessly connected devices, including high accuracy over large distances and the removal of the need for antenna arrays at each transceiver. This study investigates the use of Neural Network (NN)-based models for accurate PBR in three distinct environments: Openfield, Office, and Near Buildings, comparing their performance with established non-NN methods. A novel 2NN Model is proposed, integrating two neural networks: one to classify the environment and another to predict distances. Performance was evaluated over 20 trials for each method and dataset using root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum prediction error. Results show that the 2NN Model consistently outperformed other methods, frequently ranking among the top methods in minimizing both RMSE and maximum error. In addition, the 2NN Model achieved the best average RMSE and the lowest maximum error. To assess the effect of environment misclassification, filtered versions of the NN models were evaluated by omitting misclassified measurements prior to RMSE calculation. Although unsuitable for production use, the filtered models revealed that misclassifications in the 2NN Model had a significant impact. Its filtered variant achieved the lowest RMSE and maximum error across all datasets, and ranked first in the frequency of attaining the lowest maximum error over 20 trials. Overall, the findings show that NN models deliver robust, high-accuracy ranging across diverse environments, outperforming non-NN methods and reinforcing their potential as universal PBR solutions when trained on comprehensive distance datasets."

In this study, we comparatively examine the seasonal behaviour of vertical distribution of meteor occurrence height and decay time height at two identical radars of conjugate polar latitudes, Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and Rothera (68$^\\circ$S). In order to understand the nature of meteor trail variations, the received signal power is categorised into two groups as weak and strong echoes, and their seasonal mean vertical profiles are constructed. It has been noticed that the meteor occurrence height shown a seasonal symmetry, however, decay time vertical profiles shows an asymmetric pattern at conjugate polar latitudes, particularly for strong echoes. Seasonally, there is about 1 km difference in occurrence height and decay time height of weak and strong echoes. From the decay time vertical profiles, it has been noticed that the decay time turning altitude (i.e., inflection point) varies seasonally in the altitudes range of 80-86 km for weak and strong echoes. The maximum turning altitude of about 85 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S), similarly minimum turning altitude of about 80 km is observed in Northern winter at Esrange (68$^\\circ$N) and in Southern summer at Rothera (68$^\\circ$S). The probable reasons for such behaviour of meteor trails at opposite polar latitudes are discussed."

As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states."

MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level \"purpose\" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps."

We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates."

We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the Bézier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the Bézier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric Bézier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data."

Temporal logic expressible via the more general class of $ω$-regular objectives addresses this by precisely specifying rich behavioural properties. Even still, measuring performance by a single scalar (be it reward or satisfaction probability) masks safety-performance trade-offs that arise in settings with a tolerable level of risk. We address both limitations simultaneously by combining $ω$-regular objectives with explicit constraints, allowing safety requirements and optimisation targets to be treated separately. We develop a model-based RL algorithm based on linear programming, which in the limit produces a policy maximising the probability of satisfying an $ω$-regular objective while also adhering to $ω$-regular constraints within specified thresholds. Furthermore, we establish a translation to constrained limit-average problems with optimality-preserving guarantees."

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation."

We present SX-GeoTree, a self-explaining geospatial regression tree that integrates three coupled objectives during recursive splitting: impurity reduction (MSE), spatial residual control (global Moran's I), and explanation robustness via modularity maximization on a consensus similarity network formed from (a) geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficient distances (stimulus-response similarity) and (b) SHAP attribution distances (explanatory similarity). We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability. The framework demonstrates how spatial similarity - extended beyond geometric proximity through GWR-derived local relationships - can be embedded in interpretable models, advancing trustworthy geospatial machine learning and offering a transferable template for domain-aware explainability."

This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays."

    "abstract": "Learning effective pricing strategies is crucial in digital marketplaces, especially when buyers' valuations are unknown and must be inferred through interaction. We study the online contextual pricing problem, where a seller observes a stream of context-valuation pairs and dynamically sets prices. Moreover, departing from traditional online learning frameworks, we consider a strategic setting in which buyers may misreport valuations to influence future prices, a challenge known as strategic overfitting (Amin et al., 2013). We introduce a strategy-robust notion of regret for multi-buyer online environments, capturing worst-case strategic behavior in the spirit of the Price of Anarchy. Our first contribution is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for learning linear pricing policies in adversarial, adaptive environments, enabled by a novel online sketching technique. Building on this result, we propose our main construction: the Sparse Update Mechanism (SUM), a simple yet effective sequential mechanism that ensures robustness to all Nash equilibria among buyers. Moreover, our construction yields a black-box reduction from online expert algorithms to strategy-robust learners."

Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4~eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the high-temperature overgrowth quenches the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude, yet the 2-THz phonon mode is still observed after the overgrowth. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is qualitatively different between before and after the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the phonon frequency is defined by robust local atomic bondings such as Ga-Si at the heterointerface. The phonon amplitude, on the other hand, is determined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, which is dominated by the discrete state before the overgrowth and by charge transfer between the valence bands of the two semiconductors after the overgrowth."

The broadband response originates from two intrinsic deformation modes of the mass blocks between adjacent inclined slits: a rotational mode and a quadrupole mode. The spectral overlap of these two modes sustains a continuous high-efficiency band. The effect is robust against geometric variations, demonstrating that geometric asymmetry alone offers a minimal yet effective route to broadband elastic-wave mode conversion."

GED is determined by an optimal alignment between a pair of graphs that partitions each into aligned (zero-cost) and unaligned (cost-incurring) substructures. Due to NP-hard nature of exact GED computation, GED approximations based on Graph Neural Network(GNN) have emerged. Existing GNN-based GED approaches typically learn node embeddings for each graph and then aggregate pairwise node similarities to estimate the final similarity. Despite their effectiveness, we identify a mismatch between this prevalent node-centric matching paradigm and the core principles of GED. This discrepancy leads to two critical limitations: (1) a failure to capture the global structural correspondence for optimal alignment, and (2) a misattribution of edit costs driven by spurious node level signals. To address these limitations, we propose GCGSim, a GED-consistent graph similarity learning framework centering on graph-level matching and substructure-level edit costs. Specifically, we make three core technical contributions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GCGSim achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our comprehensive analyses further validate that the framework effectively learns disentangled and semantically meaningful substructure representations."

Employing a lock-in-amplified Ramsey magnetometry scheme, we achieve a photon-shot-noise-limited DC sensitivity of $58\\,\\text{nT}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ -- the best sensitivity reported to date for a nanofabricated cavity-based magnetometer.

We focus on two distinct rare-event regimes where standard Monte Carlo methods suffer from significant variance deterioration: the limit as maturity approaches zero and the limit as the strike price tends to infinity. Leveraging the large deviation principle (LDP), we design a state-dependent change of measure derived from the asymptotic behavior of the log-price cumulant generating functions. In the short-maturity regime, we rigorously prove that our proposed IS drift, inspired by the variational characterization of the rate function, achieves logarithmic efficiency (asymptotic optimality) by minimizing the decay rate of the second moment of the estimator. In the deep OTM regime, we introduce a novel slow mean-reversion scaling for the variance process, where the mean-reversion speed scales as the inverse square of the small-noise parameter (defined as the reciprocal of the log-moneyness). We establish that under this specific scaling, the variance process contributes non-trivially to the large deviation rate function, requiring a specialized Riccati analysis to verify optimality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields substantial variance reduction--characterized by factors exceeding several orders of magnitude--compared to standard estimators in both asymptotic regimes."

While the main result is regarding type $D_{2m} = G(2,2,2m)$, partial results are proved along the way for complex reflection groups $G(d,d,dm)$ and $G(m,1,d)$. Our framework should extend to all Weyl groups and general $G(m,r,n)$. A key ingredient in our methods is a unifying construction of modules over quantum wreath products, in terms of parabolic inductions on tensor products of the ``wreath modules'' introduced in the article.

    "abstract": "We resolve an open problem posed by Chen--Cheng--Qi (IEEE Trans.\\ Inf.\\ Theory, 2025): can decoding of binary sum-rank-metric codes $\\SR(C_1,C_2)$ with $2\\times2$ matrix blocks be reduced entirely to decoding the constituent Hamming-metric codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ without the additional requirement $d_1\\ge\\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\\mathrm{sr}}$ that underlies their fast decoder? We answer this in the affirmative by exhibiting a simple two-step procedure: first uniquely decode $C_2$, then apply a single error/erasure decoding of $C_1$.This shows that the restrictive hypothesis $d_1\\ge\\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\\mathrm{sr}}$ is theoretically unnecessary.The resulting decoder achieves unique decoding up to $\\lfloor (d_{\\mathrm{sr}}-1)/2\\rfloor$ with overall cost $T_2+T_1$, where $T_2$ and $T_1$ are the complexities of the Hamming decoders for $C_2$ and $C_1$, respectively. We further show that this reduction is asymptotically optimal in a black-box model, as any sum-rank decoder must inherently decode the constituent Hamming codes.For BCH or Goppa instantiations over $\\F_4$, the decoder runs in $O(\\ell^2)$ time."

    "abstract": "As VLMs are deployed in safety-critical applications, their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain becomes crucial for reliability, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks. For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations. Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs."

The positional stability of the trapped particle is pivotal to system performance, directly setting the measurement noise floor and operational precision. In this work, we observe bistability and hysteresis in the axial equilibrium position of a 10-um diameter SiO2 microsphere. This bistability arises from optical interference between the fiber ends and the microsphere, creating multiple potential wells. Experimental results demonstrate that the microsphere's transition rate can be effectively modulated through precise control of the trapping laser power. Furthermore, the incorporation of transverse misalignment has effectively eradicated bistability, thereby substantially improving positional stability throughout the entire optical trapping region. This suppression successfully reduced the system's residual positional uncertainty to the thermal noise limit. Consequently, this research will enhance the precision of microparticle manipulation and the sensitivity of sensing in dual-fiber optical trap systems."

    "abstract": "Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection. Our source code, dataset, and trained model are available at https://github.com/toobatehreem/MedROV."

    "abstract": "While recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and prompt alignment, they often produce low-diversity outputs when sampling multiple videos from a single text prompt. We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research."

Current approaches mainly capture cross-task relations in the 2D image space, often leading to unstructured features lacking 3D-awareness. We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions. This module is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to both single and multi-view data. Extensive results on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate that our method effectively injects geometric consistency into existing MTL methods to improve performance."

However, most VLAs are trained purely by imitation, which overfits to demonstrations, and is brittle under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) directly optimizes task reward and thus addresses this misalignment, but real-robot interaction is expensive and conventional simulators are hard to engineer and transfer. We address both data efficiency and optimization stability in VLA post-training via a learned world model and an RL procedure tailored to flow-based action heads. Specifically, we introduce Prophet, a unified action-to-video robot actuation pretrained across large-scale, heterogeneous robot data to learn reusable action-outcome dynamics. It is able to few-shot adapt to new robots, objects, and environments, yielding a rollout-ready simulator. Upon Prophet, we reinforce action policies with Flow-action-GRPO (FA-GRPO), which adapts Flow-GRPO to operate on VLA actions, and with FlowScale, a stepwise reweighting that rescales per-step gradients in the flow head. Together, Prophet, FA-GRPO, and FlowScale constitute ProphRL, a practical, data- and compute-efficient path to VLA post-training. Experiments show 5-17% success gains on public benchmarks and 24-30% gains on real robots across different VLA variants."

In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels."

Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by the constant polynomial $1+x^{\\lceil{m/2}\\rceil}$, a key component of Van Hoof's construction. This asymptotic reduction translates to a factor of 100+ improvement of the $\\cnotgate$ gate counts in the implementation of the multiplication by the constant for parameters $m$ of practical importance. For the GF division, we reduce gate count complexity from $O(m^2 \\log(m))$ to $O(m^2 \\log \\log(m)/\\log(m))$ by selecting irreducible polynomials that enable efficient implementation of both the constant polynomial multiplication and field squaring operations. We demonstrate practical advantages for cryptographically relevant values of $m$. Additionally, we explore the complexity of implementing square roots of linear reversible unitaries and demonstrate that a root, although itself still a linear reversible transformation, can require asymptotically deeper circuit implementations than the original unitary."

We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model's attention mechanisms and intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder to precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round and local editing in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods."

    "abstract": "Conventional models of matching markets assume that monetary transfers can clear markets by compensating for utility differentials. However, empirical patterns show that such transfers often fail to close structural preference gaps. This paper introduces a market microstructure framework that models matching decisions as a limit order book system with rigid bid ask spreads. Individual preferences are represented by a latent preference state matrix, where the spread between an agent's internal ask price (the unconditional maximum) and the market's best bid (the reachable maximum) creates a structural liquidity constraint. We establish a Threshold Impossibility Theorem showing that linear compensation cannot close these spreads unless it induces a categorical identity shift. A dynamic discrete choice execution model further demonstrates that matches occur only when the market to book ratio crosses a time decaying liquidity threshold, analogous to order execution under inventory pressure. Numerical experiments validate persistent slippage, regional invariance of preference orderings, and high tier zero spread executions. The model provides a unified microstructure explanation for matching failures, compensation inefficiency, and post match regret in illiquid order driven environments."

We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods.

We identify signatures of a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations survive above the critical temperature for superfluidity, in the spin susceptibility and in the free energy staggering gap.

While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\\leq 5\\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\\leq z \\leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument."

A small portion of the ATCA data was previously used to determine a time delay and our result is consistent with the previous value, but with an uncertainty that is smaller by more than a factor of two. The long time-baseline of the monitoring reveals that the flux density ratio is smoothly varying on a time-scale of years, an effect which we attribute to millilensing by massive objects (>>1 M_sun) in the lensing galaxy. Image A is unpolarized in the VLA monitoring, but VLBI observations show that this is partly due to beam dilution by an unpolarized counter-jet that is only present in that image. Based on the identification of this feature as a counter-jet, we conclude that its unexpected prominence in image A is a consequence of lensing and that more detailed modelling is required in order to reconcile the VLBI morphology of each image."

Three-dimensional tomography enables direct quantification of the effective ice-water density ratio, accounting for trapped bubbles. Incorporating this effective density ratio reconciles the temperature-dependent tip angles. We also confirm that a bubble-free frozen droplet in a vacuum chamber exhibits the universal tip angle. Furthermore, X-ray imaging allows us to measure the three-phase boundary angles \\textit{in situ}, thereby validating the geometric theory behind tip formation. These findings advance our understanding of the freezing dynamics associated with multiphase systems and highlight the capabilities of high-resolution X-ray imaging in ice research."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recommender systems. This decoupled paradigm leads to two key limitations: (1) high computational overhead, since large-scale GNN inference must be repeatedly executed to refresh embeddings; and (2) lack of joint optimization, as the gradient from the recommender system cannot directly influence the GNN learning process, causing the GNN to be suboptimally informative for the recommendation task. In this paper, we propose E2E-GRec, a novel end-to-end training framework that unifies GNN training with the recommender system. Our framework is characterized by three key components: (i) efficient subgraph sampling from a large-scale cross-domain heterogeneous graph to ensure training scalability and efficiency; (ii) a Graph Feature Auto-Encoder (GFAE) serving as an auxiliary self-supervised task to guide the GNN to learn structurally meaningful embeddings; and (iii) a two-level feature fusion mechanism combined with Gradnorm-based dynamic loss balancing, which stabilizes graph-aware multi-task end-to-end training. Extensive offline evaluations, online A/B tests (e.g., a +0.133% relative improvement in stay duration, a 0.3171% reduction in the average number of videos a user skips) on large-scale production data, together with theoretical analysis, demonstrate that E2E-GRec consistently surpasses traditional approaches, yielding significant gains across multiple recommendation metrics."

To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics."

Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features."

These processes may compress nearby regions, triggering further star formation, but the significance of triggered star formation across the Galactic disc is not well understood. This pilot study combines 1.3 GHz continuum data from the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS) with 13CO (2-1) data from the Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium (SEDIGISM) survey to identify and examine molecular clouds associated with H II regions and supernovae remnants (SNRs). We focus on their physical properties and massive star formation potential. We identify 268 molecular clouds from the SEDIGISM tile covering the Galactic plane region between 341 and 343 longitude deg and latitude deg equal to or less 0.5, of which 90 clouds (34 per cent) are associated with SMGPS extended sources. Compared to unassociated clouds, we find that associated clouds exhibit significantly higher mean mass (9600 solMass vs. 2500 solMass ) and average gas surface density (104 solMass / pc^2 vs. 67 solMass / pc^2 ), and slightly elevated but comparable virial parameters. We also find that the size-linewidth scaling relation is steeper for associated clouds compared to unassociated clouds. In addition, radio luminosity shows a positive correlation with total complex mass, and the ratio L_radio/L_complex increases with source size, consistent with an evolutionary sequence where expanding H II regions progressively disrupt their natal molecular environment. These findings suggest an enhanced dynamical activity for the associated clouds and support the hypothesis that feedback from massive stars influences molecular cloud properties and may trigger star formation."

Objective: This study aimed to compare the performance of two LLMs: ChatGPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1 on real questions from the Chinese Pharmacist Licensing Examination (2017-2021), and to discuss the implications of these performance differences for AI-enabled formative evaluation. Methods: A total of 2,306 multiple-choice (text-only) questions were compiled from official exams, training materials, and public databases. Questions containing tables or images were excluded. Each item was input in its original Chinese format, and model responses were evaluated for exact accuracy. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used to compare overall performance, and Fisher's exact test was applied to year-wise multiple-choice accuracy. Results: DeepSeek-R1 outperformed ChatGPT-4o with a significantly higher overall accuracy (90.0% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001). Unit-level analyses revealed consistent advantages for DeepSeek-R1, particularly in foundational and clinical synthesis modules. While year-by-year multiple-choice performance also favored DeepSeek-R1, this performance gap did not reach statistical significance in any specific unit-year (all p > 0.05). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated robust alignment with the structural and semantic demands of the pharmacist licensure exam. These findings suggest that domain-specific models warrant further investigation for this context, while also reinforcing the necessity of human oversight in legally and ethically sensitive contexts."

    "abstract": "Comet Interceptor is an ESA science mission with payload contributions from ESA Member States and with an international participation by JAXA. It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet from the Oort Cloud, as these comets have fleeting visits to the inner Solar System lasting only months to years from first discovery, too short for the usual process of mission development to be followed. In this paper we describe a number of factors that need to be considered in selecting a target for the mission, including scientific, orbital, spacecraft and instrument constraints, and discussion of different prioritisation strategies. We find that, in the case where we have a choice of targets, our decisions will mostly be driven by orbital information, which we will have relatively early on, with information on the activity level of the comet an important but secondary consideration. As cometary activity levels are notoriously hard to predict based on early observations alone, this prioritisation / decision approach based more on orbits gives us confidence that a good comet that is compatible with the spacecraft constraints will be selectable with sufficient warning time to allow the mission to intercept it."

    "abstract": "Recent unified models integrate understanding experts (e.g., LLMs) with generative experts (e.g., diffusion models), achieving strong multimodal performance. However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation."

In this work, we propose a distinct, intrinsic mechanism for the magnetoelectric effect in quasi-2D magnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry. We demonstrate that in such parity-violating magnets, the stacking order, which id coupled with Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment, generates a stacking Berry curvature dipole (SBCD) and a stacking orbital magnetic moment dipole (SOMD). The SBCD and SOMD act as fundamental ingredients of the ME response. As concrete examples, we apply our framework to antiferromagnets such as monolayer Ca(CoN)$_2$ and multilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with stacking magnetic orders. Our results reveal the microscopic orbital origin of the ME effect in antiferromagnetic systems with vanishing net Berry curvature and orbital magnetization, governed by the interplay between layer stacking, Berry curvature, and magnetic order. The SBCD is also identified as the origin of electric-field-induced Hall effects."

Interventional radiology procedures such as core needle biopsy of focal liver lesions are ideally performed under ultrasound guidance, during which having a clear understanding of the location of the needle tip is essential to avoid adverse events and the need for repeat procedures. However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom."

Selecting appropriate exogenous features is non-trivial and calls for a principled selection framework, given the direct operational implications for day-to-day planning and reliability. This work investigates whether causal feature selection can retain the most informative weather drivers while improving parsimony and robustness for short-term load forecasting. We present a case study on Southern Ontario with two open-source datasets: (i) IESO hourly electricity consumption by Forward Sortation Areas; (ii) ERA5 weather reanalysis data. We compare different feature selection regimes (no feature selection, non-causal selection, PCMCI-causal selection) on city-level forecasting with three different time series forecasting models: GRU, TCN, PatchTST. In the feature analysis, non-causal selection prioritizes radiation and moisture variables that show correlational dependence, whereas PCMCI-causal selection emphasizes more direct thermal drivers and prunes the indirect covariates. We detail the evaluation pipeline and report diagnostics on prediction accuracy and extreme-weather robustness, positioning causal feature selection as a practical complement to modern forecasters when integrating weather into residential load forecasting."

Our approach hinges on two core assumptions: first, the elastic properties are captured by an injective deformation-force model, efficiently learned via a Multi-Layer Perceptron; second, we solve the platform's inherently smooth motion using continuous-time B-spline kinematic models. By continuously applying Newton's Second Law, our method establishes a physical link between visually-derived trajectory acceleration and predicted deformation-induced acceleration. We demonstrate that our approach not only enables robust and accurate pose estimation on non-rigid platforms, but that the properly modeled platform physics instigate inertial sensing properties. We demonstrate this feasibility on a simple spring-camera system, and show how it robustly resolves the typically ill-posed problem of metric scale and gravity recovery in monocular visual odometry."

This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\\left(ρ+p\\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\\left(ρ+p\\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l<0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\\left(ρ+p\\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system. For the cases $\\left(ρ+p\\right)\\propto a^{-3}$ and $\\left(ρ+p\\right) \\propto a^{-4}$, we obtain a description consistent with the anisotropic cosmological model described by $\\mathrm{GR}$. In all cases analyzed, a small value for the anisotropic parameter $Ω_{A}$ (on the order of $10^{-2}$) is required in order to have agreement, for example, with the age of the universe to be approximately $12-14\\, \\mathrm{Gyr}$, agreeing with the age of globular clusters. As the universe expands an isotropization is verified, with the anistropies going to zero asymptotically, similarly with what happens in an anistropic cosmological model based on $\\mathrm{GR}$."

Rotation amplifies the intrinsic EOS differences: the MIT model supports more massive ($M_{\\max} \\gtrsim 3.3\\,M_\\odot$) compact stars with larger moments of inertia and greater resistance to deformation, while the DDQM model produces larger radii, less massive stars limited by mass-shedding at lower frequencies. Combined measurements of mass, radius, and frequency can thus break the EOS degeneracy; massive, rapidly rotating pulsars favors MIT-like EOS, whereas larger radii in canonical stars point to a DDQM-like model. These rotational observables, soon to be tightly constrained by NICER and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, offer a means to test the existence and composition of self-bound quark matter in compact stars."

    "abstract": "A search is presented for the two-body charmed baryonic decays $\\overline{B}_{(s)}^{0}\\toΛ_{c}^{+}\\overlineΛ_{c}{}^{-}$, using a data sample collected by the LHCb experiment during 2011--2012 and 2015--2018 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The first observation of the $\\overline{B}_{s}^{0}\\toΛ_{c}^{+}\\overlineΛ_{c}{}^{-}$ decay is reported with $6.2σ$ significance, along with $4.3σ$ evidence for the $\\overline{B}^{0}\\toΛ_{c}^{+}\\overlineΛ_{c}{}^{-}$ decay. The branching fractions are measured to be $\\cal{B}(\\overline{B}^{0}\\toΛ_{c}^{+}\\overlineΛ_{c}^{-}) = (1.01^{+0.27}_{-0.28} \\pm 0.08 \\pm 0.15) \\times 10^{-5}$ and $\\cal{B}(\\overline{B}_{s}^{0}\\toΛ_{c}^{+}\\overlineΛ_{c}{}^{-}) = (5.0 \\pm 1.3 \\pm 0.5 \\pm 0.8) \\times 10^{-5}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third due to external inputs. These results provide novel experimental inputs for the theoretical framework describing two-body baryonic decays of $B$ mesons via $W$-emission and $W$-exchange mechanisms."

    "abstract": "This article examines the changing relationship between the public and nuclear weapons in a context of increasing international insecurity. It discusses the erosion of the nuclear taboo, understood as a normative aversion to nuclear use. Standard surveys capture abstract and rational opinions, while experimental surveys place respondents in simulated strategic scenarios designed to evoke more emotional responses. The divergence between their results is explained by the fact that they measure two different objects: rational opinions and emotional attitudes. A nationally representative survey conducted in Italy in 2025 shows that 81 percent of respondents consider nuclear weapons fundamentally different from conventional weapons and always wrong to use. Among opponents, a distinction is drawn between deontologists and consequentialists. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of integrating affective and cognitive dimensions in the study of public opinion, as a contribution to countering the normalization of nuclear weapons in political discourse."

    "abstract": "We investigate a new quantum sensor for dark matter direct detection with sub-eV sensitivity, focusing on several candidate materials that potentially host chiral phonons with large magnetic moments that can be directly read out with an external magnetometer. We focus on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as possible candidate materials for single chiral phonon detection due to their noncentrosymmetric structure, tunability, and the ability to host these excitations in stable acoustic bands. We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory. We establish that the expected sensitivity does not depend heavily on the specific choice of the MOF, enabling us to tailor the final material composition to facilitate the magnetic readout. We then propose a prototype setup able to test the direct readout of a chiral phonon sensor with a surface-integrated magnetometer."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have created new opportunities for stylometry, the study of writing styles and authorship. Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment. All artifacts of this work are published online."

This work introduces Bayesian Tensor Network Volterra kernel machines (BTN-V), extending the Bayesian Tensor Network framework to Volterra system identification. BTN-V represents Volterra kernels using canonical polyadic decomposition, reducing model complexity from O(I^D) to O(DIR). By treating all tensor components and hyperparameters as random variables, BTN-V provides predictive uncertainty estimation at no additional computational cost. Sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors enable automatic rank determination and the learning of fading-memory behavior directly from data, improving interpretability and preventing overfitting. Empirical results demonstrate competitive accuracy, enhanced uncertainty quantification, and reduced computational cost."

    "abstract": "Machine learning has become integral to Channel State Information (CSI)-based human sensing systems and is expected to power applications such as device-free activity recognition and identity detection in future cellular and Wi-Fi generations. However, these systems rely on models whose decisions can be subtly perturbed, raising concerns for security and reliability in ubiquitous sensing. Quantifying and understanding the robustness of such models, defined as their ability to maintain accurate predictions under adversarial perturbations, is therefore critical before wireless sensing can be safely deployed in real-world environments. This work presents a systematic evaluation of the robustness of CSI deep learning models under diverse threat models (white-box, black-box/transfer, and universal perturbations) and varying degrees of attack realism. We establish a framework to compare compact temporal autoencoder models with larger deep architectures across three public datasets, quantifying how model scale, training regime, and physical constraints influence robustness. Our experiments show that smaller models, while efficient and equally performant on clean data, are markedly less robust. We further confirm that physically realizable signal-space perturbations, designed to be feasible in real wireless channels, significantly reduce attack success compared to unconstrained feature-space attacks. Adversarial training mitigates these vulnerabilities, improving mean robust accuracy with only moderate degradation in clean performance across both model classes. As wireless sensing advances towards reliable, cross-domain operation, these findings provide quantitative baselines for robustness estimation and inform design principles for secure and trustworthy human-centered sensing systems."

Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated."

No quantum-classical method obtains the long-time population oscillations found in fully quantum simulations. Varying the parameters of the LVC Hamiltonian, surface hopping reproduces the correct trends in the long-time dynamics across a wide range of parameters, but generally overestimates the degree of internal conversion. On the other hand, multi-trajectory Ehrenfest gives more accurate long-time populations in proximity to the hexatriene parameter set."

In this work, we present a deep-learning approach for estimating the triaxiality and orientations of massive galaxy clusters (those with masses $\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot h^{-1}$) from 2D observables. We utilize the flagship hydrodynamical volume of the suite of cosmological-hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulations as our ground truth.

Our model is able to extract 3D geometry information from 2D idealized cluster multi-wavelength images (soft X-ray, medium X-ray, hard X-ray and tSZ effect) and mathematical graph representations of 2D cluster member observables (line-of-sight radial velocities, 2D projected positions and V-band luminosities). Our network improves cluster geometry estimation in MTNG by $30\\%$ compared to assuming spherical symmetry. We report an $R^2 = 0.85$ regression score for estimating the major axis length of triaxial clusters and correctly classifying $71\\%$ of prolate clusters with elongated orientations along our line-of-sight."

Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states."

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer."

While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems."

Unlike traditional graphic equalizer designs, which require numerous filters per delay line, we propose a scalable solution where the number of filters can be adjusted. The frequency, gain, and quality factor (Q) parameters are shared parameters across delay lines and only the gain is adjusted based on delay length. This design not only reduces the number of optimization parameters, but also remains fully differentiable and compatible with gradient-based learning frameworks. Leveraging principles of analog filter design, our method allows for efficient and accurate filter fitting using supervised learning. Our method delivers a flexible and differentiable design, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost."

This framework is generally applicable to any ocean model that uses an ALE vertical coordinate and can be tuned to fit the modeler's specific needs based on the guidelines presented herein. The method is applied to the nonhydrostatic solver presented by the authors in [Alexandris-Galanopoulos et al., 2024] and its applicability in fully nonlinear internal waves is investigated for the demanding test cases of wave breaking and overturning.

As a well-known three-dimensional ODEs model with various bursting solutions, the FitzHugh-Rinzel model has been considered in this paper. The structure of the strange attractor that appears in chaotic transitions of this model was investigated by introducing a stochastic approach to uncover the transition mechanism. To portray this idea the attractor of the dynamical system can be partitioned into some regions and a discrete evolution that is inspired by the flow between them is sketched. A suitable Markov chain has been associated with the strange attractor based on partition selected by the recognizable regions of the attractor. Then the entropy rate of the Markov chain and the topological entropy of dynamical systems are compared to decide if the associated Markov chain should be modified or not. Furthermore, the differences between entropies guide us to uncover some changes in the shape of the attractor including some new regions which play important roles in the chaotic behavior of our system. It can be also ensured with the help of Lempel-Ziv quantity that the estimated entropy rate is reliable."

However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD)."

In this study, We systematically investigate the segregation and co-segregation behaviors of eleven elements at the Σ7(0001) twist grain boundary in yttrium and their effects on stability and strength. The Σ7(0001) grain boundary exhibits weakening, with fracture occurring preferentially along path I. Segregation energy calculations show that Si, Cu, Cr, Mo and Fe prefer interstitial sites, while others occupy substitutional ones. Si, Al, Zn, Cu, Mg and Fe stabilize the boundary, while Mo, Fe, Si, Cr, Cu, Nb and Ti strengthen it, with Si offering the most balanced improvement. Co-segregation studies reveal that Si induces the enrichment of other solutes at the boundary, promoting synergistic stabilization and turning embrittling elements (Al, Mg, Zn, Zr) into strengthening agents. Electronic structure analysis shows that Si-Y covalent bonds enhance electron localization, and Si+Mg co-segregation optimizes electronic distribution through metallic-covalent cooperation, significantly improving fracture resistance. The density of states analysis indicates new low-energy deep states in the Si, and Si+Al, Si+Mg systems, which lower grain boundary energy and improve stability. This study provides guidance for designing high-performance, low-neutron-absorption Y-based alloys."

In a former study, we created a new indicator called the internal rhythm indicator of an actor. The internal rhythm indicator makes it possible to compare the citation performances among different publication years, but it is only valid within the actor based framework. In this study, we define, create, and explore the external rhythm of an actor, which is also a sequence of ratios of observed citations to expected citations. The essential difference between internal rhythm and external rhythm lies in the way they are created and hence in the point of view taken to study an actor. The former is created based on its own publication-citation matrix, while the latter is based on two publication-citation matrices. One is the same as the former. The other one is a publication-citation matrix of a collective, which includes the actor under study. The external rhythm of an actor is a citation-based indicator of research that can be used to compare not only the citation performance of an actor with that of the collective the actor is part of, but also to compare two or more actors within the same collective. We further propose a summary average of ratios indicator."

    "abstract": "Unit testing is an essential but resource-intensive step in software development, ensuring individual code units function correctly. This paper introduces AgoneTest, an automated evaluation framework for Large Language Model-generated (LLM) unit tests in Java. AgoneTest does not aim to propose a novel test generation algorithm; rather, it supports researchers and developers in comparing different LLMs and prompting strategies through a standardized end-to-end evaluation pipeline under realistic conditions. We introduce the Classes2Test dataset, which maps Java classes under test to their corresponding test classes, and a framework that integrates advanced evaluation metrics, such as mutation score and test smells, for a comprehensive assessment. Experimental results show that, for the subset of tests that compile, LLM-generated tests can match or exceed human-written tests in terms of coverage and defect detection. Our findings also demonstrate that enhanced prompting strategies contribute to test quality. AgoneTest clarifies the potential of LLMs in software testing and offers insights for future improvements in model design, prompt engineering, and testing practices."

    "abstract": "Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods."

We formulate the multi-agent coordination problem encountered in traffic scenarios as a cooperative trajectory planning problem that minimizes travel time, subject to motion primitives derived from energy-optimal solutions. The effectiveness of this framework can be further improved through replanning at each time step, enabling the system to incorporate newly observed information. To achieve real-time execution of such a multi-agent replanning scheme, we employ a GNN architecture to learn the solutions of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem from offline-generated data. The trained model produces online predictions that serve as warm-start solutions for numerical optimization, thereby enabling rapid computation of minimal exit times and the associated feasible trajectories. This learning-augmented approach substantially reduces computation time while ensuring that all state, input, and safety constraints are satisfied."

Here we reveal an additional contribution to the Faraday effect from the film interfaces. It becomes notable for films with a thickness of a few tens of nanometers. As a result, in the absorption band of the film a novel feature of the Faraday effect is experimentally observed and numerically confirmed: sign of the Faraday rotation at a fixed wavelength becomes dependent on the film thickness and therefore is ambiguously related to the sign of the gyration and magnetization of the film. We elaborated an analytical model taking into account an interplay between the bulk and surface contributions which nicely describes the experimental data. Moreover, the Faraday rotation coming purely from interfaces without any bulk contribution is demonstrated. Possible applications of the observed unusual Faraday rotation behavior include hardware data encryption and other devices performing polarization control at nanoscale."

We demonstrate that in a system consisting of graphene and a magneto-optical substrate separated by a gap, a transverse electric field is generated in graphene perpendicular to magnetic field and temperature gradient, in analogy to Nernst effect. Such photon Nernst effect is driven by nonreciprocal Casimir force carried by photons. We show that the thermal efficiency of near-field photon Nernst effect is bounded by the Carnot limit, and nonreciprocal high-k modes are needed for approaching the limit. The near-field photon Nernst effect can be useful for probing nonreciprocal radiative transfer, and energy harvesting."

    "abstract": "Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics."

    "abstract": "The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code uses a bosonic mode to encode a logical qubit, and has the attractive property that its logical Clifford gates can be implemented using Gaussian unitary gates. In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.

However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life."

We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs."

We draw upon a recently developed set of ten self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to in eight of the ten scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrow-band directed transmissions, which occurs in two of the scenarios. Further study by direct detection at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combination of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture.

Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions, we show that in a wide range of forces, one part of the momentum transferred to the system is periodically channeled into the Bose gas through the emission of dispersive density shock waves, solitons, density waves and the creation of additional phase gradients. As a result, the impurity velocity does not increase indefinitely, but periodically oscillates in time around the drift velocity. We uncover and characterize different dynamical regimes in a wide range of the impurity-boson coupling, the impurity mass and the external force. At a sufficiently large force, the Bloch oscillations cease and the impurity exhibits an unlimited acceleration."

    "abstract": "Network weights can be reverse-engineered given enough informative samples of a network's input-output function. In a teacher-student setup, this translates into collecting a dataset of the teacher mapping -- querying the teacher -- and fitting a student to imitate such mapping. A sensible choice of queries is the dataset the teacher is trained on. But current methods fail when the teacher parameters are more numerous than the training data, because the student overfits to the queries instead of aligning its parameters to the teacher. In this work, we explore augmentation techniques to best sample the input-output mapping of a teacher network, with the goal of eliciting a rich set of representations from the teacher hidden layers. We discover that standard augmentations such as rotation, flipping, and adding noise, bring little to no improvement to the identification problem. We design new data augmentation techniques tailored to better sample the representational space of the network's hidden layers. With our augmentations we extend the state-of-the-art range of recoverable network sizes. To test their scalability, we show that we can recover networks of up to 100 times more parameters than training data-points."

Then, by leveraging a graph-structured topology of the RIS-assisted PASS, a novel three-stage graph neural network (GNN) is proposed, which learns PA positions based on user locations, and RIS phase shifts according to composite channel conditions at the first two stages, respectively, and finally determines beamforming vectors. Specifically, the proposed GNN is achieved through unsupervised training, together with three implementation strategies for its integration with convex optimization, thus offering trade-offs between inference time and solution optimality. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN, and to support its unique attributes of viable generalization capability, good performance reliability, and real-time applicability.

    "abstract": "Non-Markovian noise, arising from environmental memory effects, is the most general and challenging form of noise in quantum computing, and is typically difficult to characterize and suppress. Here, we analyze and experimentally demonstrate a non-Markovian noise suppression scheme inspired by quantum purification protocols. We theoretically prove that, even without noise calibration and assumptions on specific noise models, the scheme can exponentially reduce non-Markovian error rates with respect to the ancillary system size. We implement the protocol using nuclear spins, demonstrating that non-Markovian noise can be suppressed for both unitary operations and non-unitary channels. The observed fidelities and process tomography show close agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the practicality and effectiveness of the scheme."

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms. The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shibaoshun/PromptCT."

    "abstract": "Precise access control decisions are crucial to the security of both traditional applications and emerging agent-based systems. Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions. Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility."

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive point cloud completion (DA PCC) aims to narrow the geometric and semantic discrepancies between the labeled source and unlabeled target domains. Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency."

However, achieving robust and precise motion with strong force interaction remains a significant challenge. Based on the above limitations, this paper proposes HAFO, a dual-agent reinforcement learning control framework that simultaneously optimizes both a robust locomotion strategy and a precise upper-body manipulation strategy through coupled training under external force interaction environments. Simultaneously, we explicitly model the external pulling disturbances through a spring-damper system and achieve fine-grained force control by manipulating the virtual spring. During this process, the reinforcement-learning policy spontaneously generates disturbance-rejection response by exploiting environmental feedback. Moreover, HAFO employs an asymmetric Actor-Critic framework in which the Critic-network access to privileged spring-damping forces guides the actor-network to learn a generalizable, robust policy for resisting external disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate that HAFO achieves stable control of humanoid robot under various strong force interactions, showing remarkable performance in load tasks and ensuring stable robot operation under rope tension disturbances.

It is important to estimate the outflows, due to AGN or supernovae feedback, or inflows due to bar gravity torques. However, these radial flows may be confused with non-circular motions, which are quite frequent in the center of galaxy disks. We use a simulated giant, barred spiral galaxy from the GalMer database to study the non-circular motions induced by the bar. Our goal is to identify the spurious radial flows that kinematics modeling algorithms can detect, assuming circular orbits for the gas. Using mock data of a strongly barred galaxy, we quantify the radial velocities computed by the 3D-Barolo algorithm for different disk inclinations and several bar orientations in the plane of the sky: along the major and minor kinematic axes and at 45° from them. Our results show that projection effects cause kinematics modeling algorithms to confuse the radial component of velocity due to elliptical orbits with significant radial flows with mean values up to 84 km.s$^{-1}$, within the bar region. The computed rotation curve is also wrongly estimated inside the bar region, by as much as 150 km.s$^{-1}$ for the highest inclination."

    "abstract": "We propose a scheme to manipulate the Goos-Hänchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a non-Hermitian cavity magnomechanical system. The platform consists of a yttrium-iron-garnet sphere coupled to a microwave cavity, where a strong microwave drive pumps the magnon mode and a weak field probes the cavity. The traveling field's interaction with the magnon induces gain, yielding non-Hermitian dynamics. When the traveling field is oriented at $π/2$ relative to the cavity's $x$-axis, the system realizes $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry; eigenvalue analysis reveals a third-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_3$) at a tunable effective magnon-photon coupling. Under balanced gain-loss and finite effective magnomechanical coupling, we demonstrate coherent control of the GHS by steering the system across the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transition and through $\\mathrm{EP}_3$ via the effective magnon-photon coupling, enabling pronounced enhancement or suppression of the lateral shift. Furthermore, we show that without effective magnomechanical coupling, the system exhibits a second-order exceptional point ($\\mathrm{EP}_2$) with a distinct GHS phase transition. This phase transition vanishes when the effective magnomechanical coupling exceeds a parametric threshold, where strong absorption at resonance suppresses the GHS. We also identify the intracavity length as an additional control parameter for precise shift tuning. Notably, the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric configuration yields substantially larger GHS than its Hermitian counterpart. These results advance non-Hermitian magnomechanics and open a route to GHS-based microwave components for quantum switching and precision sensing."

    "abstract": "Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains."

The second is an explainable attention mechanism that learns local responses and attributes future concentrations to specific historical lags and exogenous drivers. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from the Stockholm region, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple forecasting horizons.

Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement."

However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning."

It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besançon Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\\leq (0.000995 \\pm 0.000002)\\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\\mathrm{min}} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts.

    "abstract": "Soft robotics has advanced rapidly, yet its control methods remain fragmented: different morphologies and actuation schemes still require task-specific controllers, hindering theoretical integration and large-scale deployment. A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control."

In this paper, we theoretically verify that the optimal weight for a pseudo-label should reflect its correctness likelihood. Empirically, we observe that on the same dataset, the correctness likelihood distribution of unlabeled data remains stable, even as the number of labeled training samples varies. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Calibrated Pseudo-labeling (DiCaP), a correctness-aware framework that estimates posterior precision to calibrate pseudo-label weights. We further introduce a dual-thresholding mechanism to separate confident and ambiguous regions: confident samples are pseudo-labeled and weighted accordingly, while ambiguous ones are explored by unsupervised contrastive learning. Experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets verify that our method achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.27%."

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals. The reason for this contrasting behavior is attributed to the distinct distribution of the Berry connection polarizability in the Brillouin zone."

    "abstract": "We study the discretisation of a uniaxial (rank-one) reduction of the Oldroyd-B model for dilute polymer solutions, in which the conformation tensor is represented as $\\sig = \\vec b \\otimes \\vec b$. Building on structural analogies with MHD, we formulate a finite element framework compatible with the de Rham complex, so that the discrete velocity is exactly divergence-free. The spatial discretisation combines an interior-penalty treatment of viscosity with upwind transport to control stress layers and we prove inf-sup conditions on the mixed pairs. For time-stepping, we design an IMEX scheme that is linear at each step and show well-posedness of the fully discrete problem together with a discrete energy law mirroring the continuum dissipation. Numerical experiments on canonical benchmarks (lid-driven cavity, pipe-with-cavity and $4{:}1$ planar contraction) demonstrate accuracy and robustness for moderate-to-high Weissenberg numbers, capturing sharp stress gradients and corner singularities while retaining the efficiency gains of the uniaxial model. The results indicate that de Rham-compatible discretisations coupled with energy-stable IMEX time integration provide a reliable pathway for viscoelastic computations at elevated elasticity."

    "abstract": "A novel continuous-aperture-array (CAPA)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed. Specifically, an optimal continuous ISAC waveform is designed to form a directive beampattern for multi-target sensing while suppressing the multi-user interference (MUI). To achieve the goal of optimal waveform design, the directional beampattern of CAPA is first derived based on Green's function, whereafter a reference sensing waveform is obtained through wavenumber-domain optimization. Based on the reference sensing waveform, a weighted functional programming on the tradeoff between sensing beampattern mismatch and MUI is formulated. To solve the resulting problem, an optimal CAPA-ISAC waveform structure is analytically derived using a Lagrangian-transformation and calculus-of-variations method, where the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the optimal waveform structure is determined via Bisection search. The obtained optimal waveform reveals that it is concurrently affected by the reference sensing waveform, the channel correlations and the channel-symbol correlations. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and waveform design, demonstrating that CAPA can achieve significant performance gains against the ISAC designs based on conventional spatially discrete array in both sensing accuracy and communication reliability."

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are restricted latent class models widely used for measuring attributes of interest in diagnostic assessments in education, psychology, biomedical sciences, and related fields. Partial-mastery CDMs (PM-CDMs) are an important extension of CDMs. They model individuals' status for each attribute to be continuous for measuring the partial mastery level, which relaxes the restrictive discrete-attribute assumption of classical CDMs. As a result, PM-CDMs often yield better fits for real-world data and refined measurement of the substantive attributes of interest. However, these models inherit some strong parametric assumptions from the traditional CDMs about the item response functions and, thus, still suffer from a significant risk of model misspecification. This paper proposes a generalized additive PM-CDM (GaPM-CDM) that substantially relaxes the parametric assumptions of PM-CDMs. This proposal leverages model parsimony and interpretability by modeling each item response function as a mixture of nonparametric monotone functions of attributes. A method for the estimation of GaPM-CDM is developed, which combines the marginal maximum likelihood estimator with a sieve approximation of the nonparametric functions. The new model is applicable under both confirmatory and exploratory settings, depending on whether prior knowledge is available about the relationship between observed variables and attributes. The proposed method is applied to two measurement problems from educational testing and healthcare research, respectively, and further evaluated and compared with PM-CDMs through extensive simulation studies."

The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date."

As each subject arrives, an adaptive procedure must select both a treatment assignment probability and a linear predictor to be used in the AIPW estimator. Our goal is to construct an adaptive procedure that minimizes the Neyman Regret, which is the difference between the variance of the adaptive procedure and an oracle variance which uses the optimal non-adaptive choice of assignment probability and linear predictors. While previous work has drawn insightful connections between Neyman Regret and online convex optimization for the Horvitz--Thompson estimator, one of the central challenges for AIPW estimator is that the underlying optimization is non-convex. In this paper, we propose Sigmoid-FTRL, an adaptive experimental design which addresses the non-convexity via simultaneous minimization of two convex regrets. We prove that under standard regularity conditions, the Neyman Regret of Sigmoid-FTRL converges at a $T^{-1/2} R^2$ rate, where $T$ is the number of subjects in the experiment and $R$ is the maximum norm of covariate vectors. Moreover, we show that no adaptive design can improve upon the $T^{-1/2}$ rate under our regularity conditions. Finally, we establish a central limit theorem and a consistently conservative variance estimator which facilitate the construction of asymptotically valid Wald-type confidence intervals."

In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health."

Recently, since text-only CoT struggles to adequately capture scene details in complex spatial environments, a highly promising strategy involves leveraging visual priors to guide robotic action generation. Nevertheless, these strategies face two inherent challenges: (i) a modality gap between visual observations and low-level actions, and (ii) unstable training due to competing objectives between visual prediction and action generation. To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control. VITA introduces a implicit visual CoT: autoregressively generated tokens is simultaneously decoded into future frames predictions and robot actions, thereby internalizing visual dynamics as an inductive bias for motion planning. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world environments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. VITA improves 14.5\\%, 9.6\\% and 12.1\\% over existing baselines on CALVIN, LIBERO and SimplerEnv. Furthermore, VITA attains an average success rate of 80.5\\% across six real-world tasks, demonstrating its potential as a generalist robotic manipulation model."

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions.

Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions."

Instead, it features backloading payments and requires the agent to work in consecutive periods. Specifically, I characterize conditions under which the optimal mechanism either grants the agent flexibility to start working in any period or restricts the starting period to the first.

Traditional machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks, achieve high predictive accuracy but lack interpretability and impose significant computational costs, limiting their applicability in real-time, resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a stabilized symbolic regression framework to derive compact, analytically interpretable expressions for block error rate prediction. Trained on realistic vehicle-to-everything simulation data, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model accurately captures nonlinear dependencies on key system parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio, relative velocity, modulation and coding schemes, number of demodulation reference signal symbols, and environmental factors (line of sight/non-line of sight). Our final symbolic expression comprises only 158 nodes, enabling ultra-fast inference suitable for embedded deployment. On the test set, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model achieves a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.8684$ and mean squared error $= 2.08 \\times 10^{-2}$ in the original block error rate domain, outperforming conventional fixed-form regressions and offering comparable accuracy to neural networks while remaining fully interpretable. Overall, the proposed Stabilized Symbolic Regression Framework for V2X combines predictive performance, physical fidelity, and computational efficiency thus providing a powerful tool for real-time V2X communication system design, adaptive resource allocation, and rapid scenario evaluation."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

    "abstract": "We investigate the origin of the scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation using the \\colibre cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. At fixed halo mass, we find a clear positive correlation between stellar mass and halo concentration, particularly in low-mass haloes between $10^{11}$ and $10^{12}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$, where all halo properties are computed from the corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. Two scenarios have been proposed to explain this trend: the earlier formation of higher-concentration haloes allows more time for star formation, or the deeper gravitational potential wells of higher-concentration haloes enhance baryon retention. To distinguish between them, we examine correlations between halo concentration, stellar mass, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. While, at fixed halo mass, halo concentration correlates with stellar age, stellar age itself shows only a weak correlation with stellar mass, indicating that early formation alone cannot account for the concentration-dependence in the scatter of the SMHM relation. In contrast, both stellar metallicity and halo concentration exhibit correlations with stellar mass. The connection between halo concentration and stellar metallicity persists even when simultaneously controlling for both halo mass and stellar mass. These results support the scenario in which the deeper gravitational potentials in higher-concentration haloes suppress feedback-driven outflows, thereby enhancing both baryon and metal retention."

Particles above 100 MeV are the most penetrating. The overall particle flux impacting spacecraft increases by several orders of magnitude during the most intense SEP events and gamma-ray bursts, compared to the galactic cosmic-ray background. Unfortunately, most detectors dedicated to the monitoring of solar particles in space do not allow measurements above 200 MeV. Space agencies and the space and heliospheric weather communities are interested in improving this scenario. We propose a new, compact, low-power, and radiation-resistant instrument, intended for long-duration missions to monitor solar X-rays, electrons, and protons up to energies of tens of keV, MeV, and 600 MeV, respectively. Intense long and short gamma-ray bursts would be observed in the absence of solar activity."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of hypersonic flow fields over a compression ramp is critical for aerodynamic design but remains challenging due to the scarcity of experimental measurements such as velocity. This study systematically develops a data fusion framework to address this issue. In the first phase, a model trained solely on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data establishes a baseline for flow field prediction. The second phase demonstrates that enriching the training with both CFD and experimental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy: errors in pressure and density are reduced to 12.6% and 7.4%, respectively. This model also captures key flow features such as separation and reattachment shocks more distinctly. Physical analyses based on this improved model, including investigations into ramp angle effects and global stability analysis, confirm its utility for efficient design applications. In the third phase, a pre-trained model (using only CFD data) is successfully fine-tuned with experimental schlieren images, effectively reconstructing velocity fields and validating the transferability of the approach. This step-wise methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of combining simulation and experiment by pre-training and fine-tuning, offering a robust and efficient pathway for hypersonic flow modeling in real-world."

    "abstract": "The affine vertex operator algebras for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the Virasoro minimal models are related by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and by the Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$. Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory. In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$. On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\\mathrm{Rep}(L_\\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators. Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules."

While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC."

Our first result is a strong impossibility: For submodular reward functions, no randomized poly-time algorithm can approximate the optimal budget-feasible value within \\textit{any finite factor}, even with demand-oracle access. This result rules out extending known constant-factor guarantees from either (i) unbudgeted settings with combinatorial actions or (ii) budgeted settings with binary actions, to their combination. The hardness is tight: It holds even when all but one agent have binary actions and the remaining agent has just one additional action. On the positive side, we show that gross substitutes rewards (a well-studied strict subclass of submodular functions) admit a deterministic poly-time $O(1)$-approximation, using only value queries. Our results thus draw the first sharp separation between budgeted and unbudgeted settings in combinatorial contracts, and identifies gross substitutes as a tractable frontier for budgeted combinatorial contracts. Finally, we present an FPTAS for additive rewards, demonstrating that arbitrary approximation is tractable under any budget. This constitutes the first FPTAS for the multi-agent combinatorial-actions setting, even in the absence of budget constraints."

For probabilistic forecasting, we explore two quantile-based approaches: direct quantile regression using the pinball loss function, and a residual simulation method that transforms point forecasts into predictive distributions. To identify the main drivers of volatility, we employ gain-based and permutation feature importance techniques, consistently highlighting the significance of trading volume, lagged volatility measures, investor attention, and market capitalization. The results demonstrate that LGBM models effectively capture the nonlinear and high-variance characteristics of cryptocurrency markets while providing interpretable insights into the underlying volatility dynamics."

    "abstract": "Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed \"emergent misalignment\" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales. We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%. We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems."

    "abstract": "Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup."

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety. Moreover, the student sustains up to 4.9x faster inference, while retaining most of the gains."

This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $β$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems."

    "abstract": "Octilinear graph drawings are a standard paradigm extending the orthogonal graph drawing style by two additional slopes (+1 and -1). We are interested in two constrained drawing problems where the input specifies a so-called representation, that is: a planar embedding; the angles occurring between adjacent edges; the bends along each edge. In Orthogonal Realizability one is asked to compute any orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints, while in Orthogonal Compaction the goal is to find such a drawing using minimum area. While Orthogonal Realizability can be solved in linear time, Orthogonal Compaction is NP-hard even if the graph is a cycle. In contrast, already Octilinear Realizability is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we investigate Octilinear Realizability and Octilinear Compaction problems. We prove that Octilinear Realizability remains NP-hard if at most one face is not convex or if each interior face has at most 8 reflex corners. We also strengthen the hardness proof of Octilinear Compaction, showing that Octilinear Compaction does not admit a PTAS even if the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face. On the positive side, we prove that Octilinear Realizability is FPT in the number of reflex corners and for Octilinear Compaction we describe an XP algorithm on the number of edges represented with a +1 or -1 slope segment (i.e., the diagonals), again for the case where the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face."

    "abstract": "The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations"

    "abstract": "Learning procedural-aware video representations is a key step towards building agents that can reason about and execute complex tasks. Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure."

Our proposed procedure employs a likelihood ratio-driven adaptive allocation rule, dynamically concentrating sampling effort on the superior population while preserving asymptotic efficiency (in terms of average sample number) comparable to the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The foremost contribution of this work is the derivation of an explicit closed-form expression for the expected number of applications to the inferior treatment. This approach achieves a balanced method between statistical precision and ethical responsibility, aligning inferential reliability with patient safety. Extensive simulation studies substantiate the theoretical results, confirming stability in allocation and consistently high probability of correct selection (PCS) across different settings. In addition, we demonstrate how the adaptive procedure markedly reduces inferior allocations compared with the classical SPRT, highlighting its practical advantage in ethically sensitive sequential testing scenarios. The proposed design thus offers an ethically efficient and computationally tractable framework for adaptive sequential decision-making."

Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets."

Field or greenhouse experiments, in which experimental units are arranged as a rectangular array of experimental units are a prominent example. In plant breeding, the amount of seed available for the treatments to be tested may be so limited that only one experimental unit per treatment can be accommodated. In such settings, augmented designs become an interesting option, where a small set of treatments, for which sufficient seed is available, are replicated across the rectangular layout so that row and column effects, as well as the error variance can be estimated. Here, we consider the use of an auxiliary design, also known as a contraction, to generate an augmented row-column design. We make use of the fact that the efficiency factors of the contraction and the associated augmented design are closely interlinked. A major advantage of this approach is that an efficient contraction can be found by computer search at much higher computational speed than is required for direct search for an efficient augmented design. Two examples are used to illustrate the proposed method."

Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement.

Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization.

    "abstract": "In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks."

More precisely, our Turing-completeness proof goes via the CoT extension of the Counting RASP (C-RASP), which correspond to softmax CoT transformers that admit length generalization. We prove Turing-completeness for CoT C-RASP with causal masking over a unary alphabet (more generally, for letter-bounded languages). While we show this is not Turing-complete for arbitrary languages, we prove that its extension with relative positional encoding is Turing-complete for arbitrary languages. We empirically validate our theory by training transformers for languages requiring complex (non-linear) arithmetic reasoning."

We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents."

This study evolves Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) used by Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to investigate how environmental variability and energy costs influence the evolution of neural complexity, defined in terms of ANN size and structure. Results indicate that under energy constraints, increasing seasonality led to smaller ANNs. This challenges CBH and supports the Expensive Brain Hypothesis (EBH), as highly seasonal environments reduced net energy intake and thereby constrained brain size. ANN structural complexity primarily emerged as a byproduct of size, where energy costs promoted the evolution of more efficient networks.

Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a \"reversal curse,\" and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers."

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks."

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation.

EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query.

Despite their effectiveness, most of such models still incur severe issues such as over-smoothing and -correlation, due to their underlying objective of minimizing the Dirichlet energy and the derived neighborhood aggregation operations. In this paper, we propose the DDSM, a new MPNN model built on an optimization framework that includes the stress majorization and orthogonal regularization for overcoming the above issues. Further, we introduce the diffusion distances for nodes into the framework to guide the new message passing operations and develop efficient algorithms for distance approximations, both backed by rigorous theoretical analyses. Our comprehensive experiments showcase that DDSM consistently and considerably outperforms 15 strong baselines on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs."

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient methods are of fundamental importance in system identification and machine learning, enabling online parameter estimation for large-scale and data-streaming processes. The stochastic gradient algorithm stands as a classical identification method that has been extensively studied for decades. Under non-persistent excitation, the best known convergence result requires the condition number of the Fisher information matrix to satisfy $κ(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\varphi_i \\varphi_i^\\top) = O((\\log r_n)^α)$, where $r_n = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\|\\varphi_i\\|^2$, with strong consistency guaranteed for $α\\leq 1/3$ but known to fail for $α> 1$. This paper establishes that strong consistency in fact holds for the entire range $0 \\leq α< 1$, achieved through a novel algebraic framework that yields substantially sharper matrix norm bounds. Our result nearly resolves the four-decade-old conjecture of Chen and Guo (1986), bridging the theoretical gap from $α\\leq 1/3$ to nearly the entire feasible range."

We conduct a data-constrained MHD simulation of the global solar corona including solar wind effects of the 2024 April 8 TSE with observed magnetograms using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) within 2.5 $R_\\odot$. This TSE happened within the solar maximum, hence the global corona was highly structured. Our MHD simulation includes the energy equation with a reduced polytropic index $γ=1.05$. We compare the global magnetic field for multiple magnetograms and use synchronic frames from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to initialize the magnetic field configuration from a magneto-frictionally equilibrium solution, called the Outflow field. We detail the initial and boundary conditions employed to time-advance the full set of ideal MHD equations such that the global corona is relaxed to a steady state. The magnetic field, the velocity field, and distributions of the density and thermal pressure are successfully reproduced. We demonstrate direct comparisons with TSE images in white-light and Fe XIV emission augmented with quasi-separatrix layers, the integrated current density, and the synthetic white-light radiation, and find a good agreement between simulations and observations. This provides a fundamental background for future simulations to study the triggering and acceleration mechanisms of CMEs under solar wind effects."

    "abstract": "Modern high-performance architectures employ large last-level caches (LLCs). While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers."

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames."

Despite impressive performance, existing multi-agent systems inherently incur substantial token overhead and increased computational costs, posing challenges for large-scale deployment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Multi-agent hierarchical communication graph PRUNING framework, termed M$^3$Prune. Our framework eliminates redundant edges across different modalities, achieving an optimal balance between task performance and token overhead. Specifically, M$^3$Prune first applies intra-modal graph sparsification to textual and visual modalities, identifying the edges most critical for solving the task. Subsequently, we construct a dynamic communication topology using these key edges for inter-modal graph sparsification. Finally, we progressively prune redundant edges to obtain a more efficient and hierarchical topology. Extensive experiments on both general and domain-specific mRAG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single-agent and robust multi-agent mRAG systems while significantly reducing token consumption."

    "abstract": "This paper studies regular topological flows $f^t$ defined on closed {topological} manifolds $M^n$. The chain recurrent set of such a flow consists of a finite number of topologically hyperbolic fixed points and periodic orbits. Like their smooth analogs -- Morse-Smale flows -- regular flows possess a continuous Morse-Bott function that decreases outside the chain recurrent set and is constant on the chain components of the flow. This circumstance leads to a close connection between such flows and the topology of the carrying manifold. In particular, the ambient manifold for non-singular flows (regular flows without fixed points), by the Poincare-Hopf formula, has a zero Euler characteristic. The latter property is a criterion for a manifold $M^n$ to admit a non-singular flow in all dimensions except dimension $n=3$. Thus, in higher dimensions, any odd-dimensional manifold admits a non-singular flow, and the list of even-dimensional manifolds is quite broad; at the very least, it includes all manifolds of the form $M^{n-1}\\times\\mathbb S^1$, where $M^{n-1}$ is any closed $(n-1)$-manifold. A surprising result of the present paper is the proof of the fact that in dimension 4, all this variety of carrying spaces can only be achieved if the flow has saddle orbits of different Morse indices. Specifically, for dimensional reasons, the Morse index of a saddle orbit of a non-singular flow $f^t: M^4 \\to M^4$ can only take two values, 1 or 2. We prove that non-singular 4-flows with saddle orbits of the same Morse index exist only on skew or direct products of the 3-sphere and the circle, i.e., $M^4\\cong\\mathbb S^3\\tilde\\times\\,\\mathbb S^1$ or $M^4\\cong\\mathbb S^3\\times\\mathbb S^1$."

While the agentic artificial intelligence (AI) powered by reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution, its practical application is limited by prohibitive exploration costs and potential risks in the real world. The emerging digital twin (DT) technology provides a safe and controlled virtual environment for agentic AI training, but its effectiveness critically depends on the DT's fidelity. Policies trained in a low-fidelity DT that does not accurately represent the physical network may experience severe performance degradation upon real-world deployment. In this article, we introduce a unified DT evaluation framework to ensure trustworthy DTs in agentic AI-based network optimization. This evaluation framework shifts from conventional isolated physical accuracy metrics, such as wireless channel and user trajectory similarities, to a more holistic, task-centric DT assessment. We demonstrate it as an effective guideline for design, selection, and lifecycle management of wireless network DTs. A comprehensive case study on a real-world wireless network testbed shows how this evaluation framework is used to pre-filter candidate DTs, leading to a significant reduction in training and testing costs without sacrificing deployment performance. Finally, potential research opportunities are discussed."

However, in the era of large language models (LLMs), even a single block can contain a significant number of parameters, posing substantial communication latency, particularly for resource-constrained clients. To address this challenge in federated training/fine-tuning LLMs, we propose ParaBlock, a novel approach that establishes two parallel threads for communication and computation to enhance communication efficiency. We theoretically prove that the proposed ParaBlock achieves the same convergence rate as the standard federated block coordinate descent methods. Empirical evaluations on fine-tuning LLMs on general instruction following and mathematical reasoning confirm that ParaBlock not only maintains strong performance but also significantly improves communication efficiency."

For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

    "abstract": "In recent years, resource elasticity and cost optimization have become essential for RDBMSs. While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters."

We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks."

As data become increasingly recognized as an economic asset, data marketplaces have emerged as a key infrastructure for data-driven innovation. However, unlike mature product or service markets, data-trading environments remain nascent and suffer from pronounced information asymmetry. Buyers cannot verify the content or quality before purchasing data, making trust and quality assurance central challenges. To address these issues, this study develops a multi-agent data-market simulator that models participant behavior and evaluates the institutional mechanisms for trust formation. Focusing on the manufacturing sector, where initiatives such as GAIA-X and Catena-X are advancing, the simulator integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive agent behavior and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate utility functions from empirical behavioral data. Using the simulator, we examine the market-level effects of five representative reputation systems-Time-decay, Bayesian-beta, PageRank, PowerTrust, and PeerTrust-and found that PeerTrust achieved the strongest alignment between data price and quality, while preventing monopolistic dominance. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid reputation mechanism that integrates the strengths of existing systems to achieve improved price-quality consistency and overall market stability. This study extends simulation-based data-market analysis by incorporating trust and reputation as endogenous mechanisms and offering methodological and institutional insights into the design of reliable and efficient data ecosystems."

A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures."

We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference.

    "abstract": "Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing."

    "abstract": "We derive Standard Model predictions for the CP asymmetries of singly-Cabibbo suppressed $D\\rightarrow Pη'$ decays, where $P=K,π,η$. Our predictions are based on the approximate SU(3)$_F$ symmetry of QCD and include first-order symmetry-breaking effects in a systematic way. The underlying symmetry leads to correlations between different decay modes. To this end we predict the correlations between $ a_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(D^+\\to π^+ η')$ and $a_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(D_s^+ \\to K^+ η')$ as well as $a_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(D^0\\to π^0 η')$ and $ a_{\\rm CP}^{\\rm dir}(D^0\\to ηη')$. Our results can be used to probe the Standard Model with future measurements by LHCb, Belle II and BESIII. At the same time, such future measurements permit the extraction of the key theory parameter related to the ratio of color-suppressed to color-favoured contributions to the decay amplitudes. Future data on both branching ratios and CP asymmetries will automatically improve our predictions and thereby also their sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model."

We present exact, closed-form solutions for steady-state resonant-line radiative transfer in \"V-shaped\" atomic networks, where a single ground state couples to multiple transitions. Starting from the full angle-dependent transfer equation, we generalize absorption and emission coefficients to an arbitrary number of lines, derive a modified Fokker-Planck expansion of the frequency-redistribution COLT Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and find excellent agreement with the analytic predictions across a wide range of line separations, optical depths, and damping parameters, establishing our solutions as stringent validation benchmarks. For concrete applications related to the Lyman-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, we examine how fine-structure splitting and deuterium injection modify the emergent spectra, internal radiation field, and radiative force multiplier. We show that these effects leave previous conclusions about Lyman-alpha feedback in the early universe essentially unchanged. Even when direct observational diagnostics are subtle, our framework provides novel analytic and numerical insights into coupled resonance-line transport and facilitates progress in general modeling of multi-line radiative transfer in diverse astrophysical settings."

ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs. ReaDe offers a practical route to aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent. Project Page: https://sqwu.top/ReaDe/."

To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

The significant challenge is to combine the regularizing effect of the fBm with an ergodic theory suited to non-Markovian SDE. Concerning the latter our first main contribution is to construct a bona fide stochastic dynamical system (SDS) (Hairer `05 and Hairer--Ohashi `07) associated to the equation above. Since the solution map is only continuous in the support of the stationary noise process we weaken the definitions introduced by Hairer `05 and Hairer--Ohashi `07 but manage to retain the Doob--K'hashminksii provided by Hairer--Ohashi `07. Our second innovation is to introduce a family of flexible local-global stochastic sewing lemmas, in the vein of Lê `20, which allows us to efficiently treat small and large scales simultaneously. By tuning the local scale as a function of $\\|g\\|_{B^α_{\\infty,\\infty}}$ we are able to obtain the necessary continuity of the semi-group and stability estimates to show unique ergodicity for all $g\\in B^α_{\\infty,\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$.

Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions. This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques. In this paper, we design a novel Path-guided, Iterative LLM-Orchestrated Testing framework, called PILOT, to fuzz CLI applications. The key insight is to provide potential call paths to target functions as context to LLM so that it can better generate CLI option strings and input files. Then, PILOT iteratively repeats the process, and provides reached functions as additional context so that target functions are reached. Our evaluation on real-world CLI applications demonstrates that PILOT achieves higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches and discovers 51 zero-day vulnerabilities. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their developers and so far 41 have been confirmed by their developers with 33 being fixed and three assigned CVE identifiers."

    "abstract": "Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques."

    "abstract": "Quantum circuits provide an emerging controllable platform to realize novel dynamical non-equilibrium phases including topologically ordered states. The Kitaev model has become a cornerstone of quantum magnetism due to its quantum spin liquid ground state and rich phase diagram. The Kitaev model has also been treated in the monitored circuit setting, giving rise to topological area-law and critical-law entanglement entropy phases. In this article, we study the evolution of its phase diagram under the addition of new terms, motivated by their effects in the Kitaev model. We find that a single-qubit term, analogous to a magnetic field, leads to a trivial state in the high field limit, but with an additional intermediate volume-law phase. A three-qubit operator that commutes with the flux operators has the opposite effect: it stabilizes the critical-law phase against the short ranged area-law entanglement. We also employ a four-qubit plaquette commuting operator that simultaneously measures two opposite identical-type bonds on a plaquette. This generates a distinct volume-law phase and preserves the plaquette fluxes and associated topological order, yielding extensive entanglement while coexisting with the topological memory characteristic of the area-law phase. We quantitatively locate phase boundaries using stabilizer (Clifford) simulations together with tripartite mutual information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results highlight the rich phase diagram accessible from the measurement-only Kitaev model as well as suggesting rules relating the newly added operators to the phases they promote."

In particular, seizure onset can be described as a critical transition (CT), but there is no consensus on whether (i) bifurcation-induced, (ii) noise-induced, or (iii) bifurcation/noise-induced CTs are responsible. To clarify this, we develop a versatile CT-classification framework that can be applied to seizures in both animals and humans. First, we identify a canonical mathematical model which displays CTs that closely resemble voltage recordings of real seizures and can be of the three types mentioned above. We then identify distinctive properties of each CT-type in the model's output and use them to train a machine learning CT-type classifier. Finally, we apply the model-trained classifier to voltage recordings from epileptic rodents. We find that the largest proportion of analysed seizures are classified as noise-induced CTs. This challenges the conventional view that seizures are predominantly bifurcation-induced and could inform new therapeutic strategies for seizures."

Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste."

This challenge is further compounded by the diversity of model architectures, which shape how traffic is represented and synthesized. We introduce a comprehensive set of privacy metrics for synthetic network traffic, combining standard approaches like membership inference attacks (MIA) and data extraction attacks with network-specific identifiers and attributes. Using these metrics, we systematically evaluate the vulnerability of different representative generative models and examine the factors that influence attack success. Our results reveal substantial variability in privacy risks across models and datasets. MIA success ranges from 0% to 88%, and up to 100% of network identifiers can be recovered from generated traffic, highlighting serious privacy vulnerabilities. We further identify key factors that significantly affect attack outcomes, including training data diversity and how well the generative model fits the training data. These findings provide actionable guidance for designing and deploying generative models that minimize privacy leakage, establishing a foundation for safer synthetic network traffic generation."

To avoid the redundant AI/ML computations caused by repeated data records in the join's output, factorized ML has been proposed to decompose ML computations into sub-computations to be executed on each normalized dataset. However, there is insufficient discussion on how factorized ML could impact AI/ML inference over multi-way joins. To address the limitations, we propose a novel declarative InferF system, focusing on the factorization of arbitrary inference workflows represented as analyzable expressions over the multi-way joins. We formalize our problem to flexibly push down partial factorized computations to qualified nodes in the join tree to minimize the overall inference computation and join costs and propose two algorithms to resolve the problem: (1) a greedy algorithm based on a per-node cost function that estimates the influence on overall latency if a subset of factorized computations is pushed to a node, and (2) a genetic algorithm for iteratively enumerating and evaluating promising factorization plans. We implement InferF on Velox, an open-sourced database engine from Meta, evaluate it on real-world datasets, observed up to 11.3x speedups, and systematically summarized the factors that determine when factorized ML can benefit AI/ML inference workflows."

Nemotron-Parse-1.1 follows an encoder-decoder architecture with 885M parameters, including a compact 256M-parameter language decoder. It achieves competitive accuracy on public benchmarks making it a strong lightweight OCR solution. We release the model weights publicly on Huggingface, as well as an optimized NIM container, along with a subset of the training data as part of the broader Nemotron-VLM-v2 dataset. Additionally, we release Nemotron-Parse-1.1-TC which operates on a reduced vision token length, offering a 20% speed improvement with minimal quality degradation."

    "abstract": "Reasoning based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention due to outstanding performance of these models in mathematical and complex logical tasks. Beginning with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique, numerous reasoning methods have emerged that decompose problems into smaller, sequential steps (or thoughts). However, existing reasoning models focus on conventional problem-solving and do not necessarily generate creative solutions by ``creative reasoning''. In domains where the solution space is expansive and conventional solutions are suboptimal, such as drug discovery or business strategization, creative reasoning to discover innovative solutions is crucial. To address this gap, first we introduce a computational framework for creative reasoning inspired by established cognitive science principles. With this framework, we propose three core creative reasoning paradigms, namely, \\textit{combinational}, \\textit{exploratory}, and \\textit{transformative} reasoning, where each offers specific directions for systematic exploration of the universe of thoughts to generate creative solutions. Next, to materialize this framework using LLMs, we introduce the \\textit{Universe of Thoughts} (or \\textit{UoT}, for short), a novel set of methods to implement the aforementioned three creative processes. Finally, we introduce three novel tasks that necessitate creative problem-solving, along with an evaluation benchmark to assess creativity from three orthogonal perspectives: feasibility as constraint, and utility and novelty as metrics. With a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning techniques as well as representative commercial models with reasoning capability, we show that UoT demonstrates superior performance in creative reasoning."

    "abstract": "Extracting individual elements from music mixtures is a valuable tool for music production and practice. While neural networks optimized to mask or transform mixture spectrograms into the individual source(s) have been the leading approach, the source overlap and correlation in music signals poses an inherent challenge. Also, accessing all sources in the mixture is crucial to train these systems, while complicated. Attempts to address these challenges in a generative fashion exist, however, the separation performance and inference efficiency remain limited. In this work, we study the potential of diffusion models to advance toward bridging this gap, focusing on generative singing voice separation relying only on corresponding pairs of isolated vocals and mixtures for training. To align with creative workflows, we leverage latent diffusion: the system generates samples encoded in a compact latent space, and subsequently decodes these into audio. This enables efficient optimization and faster inference. Our system is trained using only open data. We outperform existing generative separation systems, and level the compared non-generative systems on a list of signal quality measures and on interference removal. We provide a noise robustness study on the latent encoder, providing insights on its potential for the task. We release a modular toolkit for further research on the topic."

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances."

Computing a valid safe set and BF for a nonlinear (and potentially unmodeled), non-autonomous dynamical system is a difficult task. This work explores the design of BFs using data to obtain safe sets with deterministic assurances of control invariance. We leverage ReLU neural networks (NNs) to create continuous piecewise affine (CPA) BFs with deterministic safety guarantees for Lipschitz continuous, discrete-time dynamical system using sampled one-step trajectories. The CPA structure admits a novel classifier term to create a relaxed \\ac{bf} condition and construction via a data driven constrained optimization. We use iterative convex overbounding (ICO) to solve this nonconvex optimization problem through a series of convex optimization steps. We then demonstrate our method's efficacy on two-dimensional autonomous and non-autonomous dynamical systems."

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\\% on MME-RealWorld-RS. Meanwhile, it achieves much higher inference efficiency, outperforming prior search-based methods by 20%~44% in speed."

In particular, the axion-photon couplings grow with $h^{1,1}$, and models in our ensemble with $h^{1,1} \\gtrsim$ 10,000 axions are in tension with helioscope constraints. Moreover, under mild assumptions about charged matter beyond the Standard Model, theories with $h^{1,1} \\gtrsim$ 5,000 are in tension with Chandra measurements of X-ray spectra.

The method leverages the DT for geometric path association and employs RANSAC to identify reliable line-of-sight (LOS) and single-bounce NLOS paths while rejecting multi-bounce outliers. A final optimization on the resulting inlier set estimates the user's position and clock bias. Simulations validate that by effectively turning NLOS paths into valuable geometric information via the DT, the approach enables accurate localization, reduces reliance on direct LOS, and significantly lowers system deployment costs, making it suitable for practical deployment."

    "abstract": "Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are the dominant Ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray sources in the LHAASO catalog suggesting that they are the dominant leptonic PeVatrons in our Galaxy. Despite this, still very little is known about their UHE gamma-ray emission, their number in the Galaxy, or their contribution to the gamma-ray emission of our Galaxy. In this work, we propose a self-consistent data-driven model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe based on the ATNF and LHAASO catalogs. More specifically, we build a model of the UHE gamma-ray emission of PWNe that preserves the statistical relationships in the ATNF catalog and reproduces the number of PWNe detected in the LHAASO catalog. To cope with the limited data available in the LHAASO catalog when performing fits on gamma-ray data, we introduce the concept of censored regression that allows to also use the information provided by unresolved sources. Using our model, we find that reproducing the number of PWNe detected by LHAASO requires either fractions of misaligned pulsars smaller ($\\lesssim60\\%$) than usually found in the literature, or that some of the associations of PWNe to ATNF pulsars made by LHAASO may not be true. In both cases, we find that in order to reach self-consistency between radio and gamma-ray data, it is necessary that the majority of the unidentified sources in the LHAASO catalog are PWNe associated to an unseen pulsar. Moreover, using our model we also find that the contribution of unresolved PWNe to the total (diffuse) gamma-ray background measured by LHAASO in the $1-1000\\,\\rm{TeV}$ range is always smaller than $\\lesssim10\\%$ ($\\lesssim30\\%$). We conclude that PWNe mostly contribute to the source component of the UHE gamma-ray sky, while having almost no imprint on its diffuse component."

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions are a promising probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, as many extensions of the standard model result in first-order phase transitions in the early universe, from which the resulting gravitational waves could be detectable with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The properties of the phase transition and the resulting gravitational wave spectrum are determined by five key parameters: the nucleation temperature $T_n$, phase transition strength at the nucleation temperature $α_n$, bubble wall speed $v_\\text{wall}$, transition rate $β$ and the sound speed $c_s$. Of these, the sound speed $c_s$ is determined by the equation of state $p(T,φ)$. In most studies, the plasma of the early universe has been assumed to be ultrarelativistic and therefore following the bag equation of state with $c_s = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. In this thesis, the PTtools simulation framework for first-order phase transitions, based on the Sound Shell Model, has been extended to include support for arbitrary equations of state and therefore for a temperature- and phase-dependent sound speed $c_s(T,φ)$. The thesis also functions as a reference manual for PTtools. The framework has been tested with the constant sound speed model, in which the sound speed is a different constant in each phase. The sound speed has been shown to have a significant effect on the resulting gravitational wave spectrum, especially when changing the sound speed results in a change in the type of the solution. This has laid the groundwork for simulating cosmological phase transitions with realistic equations of state. This will result in in gravitational wave spectra that can be used in the LISA data analysis pipeline to search for the existence and parameters of a first-order phase transition in the early universe."

Aims: Our aim is to investigate whether LISA can resolve WD binaries in GCs well enough in terms of sky location and distance that they can be distinguished from binaries in the MW disc. Methods: We used a sample of 20 of the most massive GCs around the MW and simulated LISA's sky location and distance measurement errors for WD binaries in these GCs using the software package GWToolbox. We did this in the context of a model of the LISA-detectable binaries in the MW from the population synthesis code SeBa. Results: We find that for five of the GCs in our sample, binaries in the GC could be easily distinguished from MW disc binaries using the sky location alone; for another five, binaries in the GCs could be distinguished using a combination of LISA's sky location and distance measurements; and for the final ten, binaries in the GCs could not be distinguished from overlapping MW disc binaries. The results depend strongly on the sky locations of the GCs, with GCs far away from the Galactic plane being easy to resolve, while GCs close to the Galactic centre overlap with many MW disc binaries. The most promising GC for finding a WD binary that could be resolved to that GC, based on sky location and GC mass, is 47 Tucanae."

By probing the intricate interplay between system parameters and frictional behavior, scientists seek to unveil the underlying mechanisms that enable prediction and control of friction -- an essential step toward carbon neutrality. Yet, reproducing frictional behavior in experiments is notoriously difficult. Here, we show that this challenge stems from the extreme sensitivity of tribological systems to tiny variations, e.g. in surface topography, typically presumed well-controlled. Even after meticulous surface preparation to semiconductor-industry standards and curtailing misalignment-induced oscillations, subtle variations remain and interact. In turn, such minute initial differences lead to statistically significant variations in friction and wear, giving rise to system-level chaotic behavior. Yet, by leveraging mid-scale features of surface topography and misalignment-induced oscillations -- information often filtered out or overlooked -- we established a model that accurately predicts high-friction regions under vastly different lubrication scenarios, with its performance further enhanced by machine learning."

We introduce a self-driven, rheometer-like assay in which collective migration generates stationary shear flows, allowing rheological parameters to be inferred directly from image sequences. The assay relies on two sets of ring-shaped fibronectin patches, micropatterned in arrays for high-throughput imaging. Within isolated rings, the epithelial tissue exhibits persistent rotation, from which we infer active migration stresses and substrate friction. Within partially overlapping rings, the tissue exhibits sustained shear, from which we infer the elastic and viscous responses of the cells. The emergence of a Maxwell-like viscoelastic relation -- characterized by a linear relationship between mean cell deformation and neighbor-exchange rate -- is specifically recapitulated within a wet vertex-model framework, which reproduces experimental measurements only when intercellular viscous dissipation is included alongside substrate friction. We apply our method to discriminate the respective roles of two myosin~II isoforms in tissue mechanics. Overall, by harnessing self-generated stresses instead of externally imposed ones, we propose a noninvasive route to rheological inference in migrating epithelial tissues and, more generally, in actively flowing granular materials."

This calls for an urgent need to understand how toxic content spreads and how it might be mitigated on online social networks, and expectedly has been the topic of extensive research in recent times. Prior work has largely modelled hate through epidemic or spread activation based diffusion models, in which the users are often divided into two categories, hateful or not. In this work, users are treated as transformers of toxicity, based on how they respond to incoming toxicity. Compared with the incoming toxicity, users amplify, attenuate, or replicate (effectively, transform) the toxicity and send it forward. We do a temporal analysis of toxicity on Twitter, Koo and Gab and find that (a) toxicity is not conserved in the network; (b) only a subset of users change behaviour over time; and (c) there is no evidence of homophily among behaviour-changing users. In our model, each user transforms incoming toxicity by applying a \"shift\" to it prior to sending it forward. Based on this, we develop a network model of toxicity spread that incorporates time-varying behaviour of users. We find that the \"shift\" applied by a user is dependent on the input toxicity and the category. Based on this finding, we propose an intervention strategy for toxicity reduction. This is simulated by deploying peace-bots. Through experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks, we demonstrate that peace-bot interventions can reduce toxicity, though their effectiveness depends on network structure and placement strategy."

For exact hopsets of $n$-node, $m$-edge weighted graphs, the size of the output hopset is existentially optimal up to subpolynomial factors, under some technical assumptions. Despite their simplicity and conceptual implications, these greedy algorithms are slower than existing sampling-based approaches. Our second set of results focus on faster deterministic algorithms that are based on a certain greedy set cover approximation algorithm on paths in the transitive closure. One consequence is a deterministic algorithm that takes $O(mn^{2/3})$ time to compute a shortcut set of size $\\tilde{O}(n)$ and hopbound $O(n^{1/3})$."

This is particularly appealing in Federated Learning (FL), where momentum intuitively appears as a solution to mitigate the effects of statistical heterogeneity. Despite recent progress in this direction, it is still unclear if momentum can guarantee convergence under unbounded heterogeneity in decentralized scenarios, where only some workers participate at each round. In this work we analyze momentum under cyclic client participation, and theoretically prove that it remains inevitably affected by statistical heterogeneity. Similarly to SGD, we prove that decreasing step-sizes do not help either: in fact, any schedule decreasing faster than $Θ\\left(1/t\\right)$ leads to convergence to a constant value that depends on the initialization and the heterogeneity bound. Numerical results corroborate the theory, and deep learning experiments confirm its relevance for realistic settings."

This makes exploring the capabilities of different attosecond imaging techniques crucial. Here, we propose attosecond momentum-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a prominent technique for tracking ultrafast dynamics. We demonstrate that the scattering signal contains an information about the instantaneous distribution of charge density across the scattering atoms. To illustrate this, we consider scattering from an $α$-sexithiophene molecule, in which coupled electron-hole dynamics are excited."

The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics.

    "abstract": "This study provides a causal validation of the dual-stressor hypothesis in a long-cycle engineering programme in Argentina, testing whether academic staff strikes (proximal shocks) and inflation (distal shocks) jointly shape student dropout. Using a leak-aware longitudinal panel of 1,343 students and a manually implemented LinearDML estimator, we estimate lagged causal effects of strike exposure and its interaction with inflation at entry. The temporal profile is clear: only strikes occurring two semesters earlier have a significant impact on next-semester dropout in simple lagged logit models (ATE = 0.0323, p = 0.0173), while other lags are negligible. When we move to double machine learning and control flexibly for academic progression, curriculum friction and calendar effects, the main effect of strikes at lag 2 becomes small and statistically non-significant, but the interaction between strikes and inflation at entry remains positive and robust (estimate = 0.0625, p = 0.0033). A placebo model with a synthetic strike variable yields null effects, and a robustness audit (seed sensitivity, model comparisons, SHAP inspection) confirms the stability of the interaction across specifications. SHAP analysis also reveals that Strikes_Lag2 and Inflation_at_Entry jointly contribute strongly to predicted dropout risk. These findings align with the CAPIRE-MACRO agent-based simulations and support the view that macro shocks act as coupled stressors mediated by curriculum friction and financial resilience rather than isolated events."

    "abstract": "Secure aggregation (SA) is fundamental to privacy preservation in federated learning (FL), enabling model aggregation while preventing disclosure of individual user updates. This paper addresses hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) against relay and user collusion in homogeneous networks, where each user connects to $n$ relays and each relay serves $m$ users. In the two-phase communication framework, users transmit masked data to relays, which then process and forward compiled messages to the server for exact sum recovery. The primary objective is to devise a transmission scheme such that the server can finish the aggregation task, while any group of $T_h$ colluding relays and $T_u$ colluding users cannot reveal any information about the data owned by the non-colluding users. In this study, we establish fundamental limits on the communication load, defined as the ratio of transmitted information size to original data size, for each user-relay link and each relay-server link. Achievable thresholds for collusion resilience are also derived. When the number of colluding relays and users falls below certain critical thresholds, we construct communication-optimal schemes using methods from network function computation. A limitation of these schemes is their reliance on large random keys. To address this, we derive a lower bound on the required key size and prove its achievability in cyclic networks, where users are connected to relays in a cyclic wrap-around manner. By establishing a connection between HSA and network function computation, this work advances the theoretical limits of communication efficiency and information-theoretic security in secure aggregation."

    "abstract": "Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination."

In this work, we propose a generalization of the BART model that has two main features: first, it automatically selects the number of decision trees using the given data; second, the model allows clusters of observations to have different regression functions since each data point can only use a selection of weak learners, instead of all of them. This model generalization is accomplished by including a binary weight matrix in the conditional distribution of the response variable, which activates only a specific subset of decision trees for each observation. Such a matrix is endowed with an Indian Buffet process prior, and sampled within the MCMC sampler, together with the other BART parameters. We then compare the Infinite BART model with the classic one on simulated and real datasets. Specifically, we provide examples illustrating variable importance, partial dependence and causal estimation."

The AIS-stratified architecture is treated as a diegetic prototype placed in a plausible near-future setting and examined through the method of design fiction. By embedding the architecture in narrative scenarios, the study explores how such agents might influence access to care and therapeutic relationship.

Our main results: (i) the frontier exhibits concave structure with monotonically decreasing slope, (ii) traversing from maximum targeted matches to maximum total matches reduces matches by at most half, (iii) the Repeated Hungarian Algorithm computes all frontier points in polynomial time, and (iv) mechanisms with beneficiary-share guarantees can respect category-dependent priority orderings but necessarily violate path-independence.

This additional term is defined in terms of solutions to a Steklov-type spectral problem, where the eigenvalue appears both in the equation and the boundary conditions. The ``strange term'' for the problem with Robin conditions converges to zero as the Robin parameter tends to zero and, at least under suitable assumptions, it converges to the capacitary ``strange term'' for the Dirichlet problem as the Robin parameter tends to infinity."

    "abstract": "An important process in tropical cyclone formation is the development of a deep, warm core, which corresponds to the growth of a barotropic cyclone. Persistent convective activity is known to be crucial for the growth of barotropic vorticity. However, it remains unclear whether the fluctuating component of convective activity, such as that caused by the diurnal cycle and inertial-gravity waves, also accelerates the vortex development. To investigate this problem, numerical simulations are performed in an axisymmetric model with the Boussinesq approximation on the f-plane. Convection is parameterized with a bulk-plume mass-flux scheme. To represent a mesoscale convective system modulated by the diurnal cycle, periodic convective mass flux is imposed in a local region. The convection induces periodic diabatic heating and convective momentum transfer in the vertical direction (CMT). The CMT is an irreversible effect that breaks the quadrature phase relation between vertical velocity and vertical vorticity, producing a residual barotropic vorticity in each cycle. The barotropic vorticity consists of a barotropic cyclonic core and an anticyclonic shell. The cyclonic core is produced by the vertical advection and stretching of vertical vorticity. The anticyclonic shell is produced by the radial advection and tilting of radial vorticity. The analytical solution reproduces the formation and growth of the core-shell vorticity structure. This research reveals a potential acceleration effect of periodic convective activity on tropical cyclone genesis."

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs."

Clustering over such data finds numerous practical applications in real scenarios, including social community detection, medical data analytics, etc. However, as revealed by our empirical studies, existing multi-view clustering solutions largely rely on the high correlation between attributes across various views and overlook the unique characteristics (e.g., low modality-wise correlation and intense feature-wise noise) of multimodal attributes output by large pre-trained language and vision models in MMAGs, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. Inspired by foregoing empirical observations and our theoretical analyses with graph signal processing, we propose the Dual Graph Filtering (DGF) scheme, which innovatively incorporates a feature-wise denoising component into node representation learning, thereby effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional graph filters adopted in the extant multi-view graph clustering approaches. On top of that, DGF includes a tri-cross contrastive training strategy that employs instance-level contrastive learning across modalities, neighborhoods, and communities for learning robust and discriminative node representations. Our comprehensive experiments on eight benchmark MMAG datasets exhibit that DGF is able to outperform a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines consistently and significantly in terms of clustering quality measured against ground-truth labels."

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT."

The Fourier space readout (FSR) and the proposed approximate real space readout (ARSR) methods are currently the most efficient and practical ones for the purpose of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions. In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices."

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $Σ_K$, and prove a \\textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $Σ_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$).

To overcome these challenges, we propose iRadioDiff, a sampling-free diffusion-based framework for indoor RM construction. iRadioDiff is conditioned on access point (AP) positions, and physics-informed prompt encoded by material reflection and transmission coefficients. It further incorporates multipath-critical priors, including diffraction points, strong transmission boundaries, and line-of-sight (LoS) contours, to guide the generative process via conditional channels and boundary-weighted objectives.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively.

However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods."

Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications."

    "abstract": "Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks."

    "abstract": "The shift from point-based thermal sensing to filter-free thermal imaging requires luminescent thermometers that exhibit pronounced and thermally driven spectral changes within spectral regions matching the sensitivity profiles of the R, G, and B channels of a digital camera. In this work, we introduce such a system, enabled by the synergistic interplay between (i) thermal redistribution among the vibronic components of the 4T1 excited state of Mn2+ ions and (ii) thermally assisted population of this state via optical trap sites. These combined processes result in a simultaneous thermal enhancement and blueshift of the Mn2+ emission band associated with the 4T1 -> 6A1 electronic transition. Consequently, the emission intensity recorded in the G channel increases with temperature, while the luminescence signals detected in the B channel exhibit a corresponding decrease. As demonstrated, Ca19Zn2(PO4)14:Mn2+, Ce3+ supports not only sensitive filter-free thermal imaging, but also two additional ratiometric readout schemes: one based on the intensity ratio of Ce3+ and Mn2+ emissions, and another based on two distinct spectral regions of the Mn2+ emission band, yielding maximum relative sensitivities of 0.42% K^-1 and 2.7% K^-1, respectively. This approach introduces a unique thermometric strategy that enables simple, robust, and cost-effective two-dimensional thermal imaging without the need for optical filters or specialized instrumentation."

    "abstract": "The memory capacity in edge devices is often limited due to constraints on cost, size, and power. Consequently, memory competition leads to inevitable page swapping in memory-constrained mixed-criticality edge devices, causing slow storage I/O and thus performance degradation. In such scenarios, inefficient memory allocation disrupts the balance between application performance, causing soft real-time (soft RT) tasks to miss deadlines or preventing non-real-time (non-RT) applications from optimizing throughput. Meanwhile, we observe unpredictable, long system-level stalls (called long stalls) under high memory and I/O pressure, which further degrade performance. In this work, we propose a Stall-Aware Real-Time Memory Allocator (SARA), which discovers opportunities for performance balance by allocating just enough memory to soft RT tasks to meet deadlines and, at the same time, optimizing the remaining memory for non-RT applications. To minimize the memory usage of soft RT tasks while meeting real-time requirements, SARA leverages our insight into how latency, caused by memory insufficiency and measured by our proposed PSI-based metric, affects the execution time of each soft RT job, where a job runs per period and a soft RT task consists of multiple periods. Moreover, SARA detects long stalls using our definition and proactively drops affected jobs, minimizing stalls in task execution. Experiments show that SARA achieves an average of 97.13% deadline hit ratio for soft RT tasks and improves non-RT application throughput by up to 22.32x over existing approaches, even with memory capacity limited to 60% of peak demand."

Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods."

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://ubc-vision.github.io/sonic/"

The OR protocol is shown to perform better and in the process also slightly extend the known correlations that collapse communication complexity. This emphasizes again the need to understand the local properties of nonlocal systems in order to obtain a better characterization of the global behavior.

When a photon counting device observes a bright source, we face an unavoidable problem called pile-up. Pile-up leads to mistakes in the observational properties of the source, mainly an apparent decrease in the X-ray flux. X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has two X-ray telescopes, one of which is Xtend, a CCD camera with a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 38 arcmin square. Xtend has three operating modes: full window mode with a frame exposure of ~4 s, 1/8 window mode with ~0.5s and reduced FOV, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, whose frame exposure is reduced to ~0.06 s. Observers need to select the operating mode according to their target fluxes. We develop the pile-up simulator for Xtend to provide a quantitative assessment of pile-up according to the fluxes, spectra, and shapes of X-ray sources. We derived the 10% pile-up limits for a point source of 7.8, 66.2, and 447.9 counts/s for full window, 1/8 window, and 1/8 window mode with burst option, respectively, by assuming the Crab spectrum.

    "abstract": "Clemmesen's hook refers to a commonly observed slowdown and rebound in breast cancer incidence around the age at menopause. It suggests a shift in the underlying carcinogenic dynamics, but the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Building on our previously developed Extended Multistage Clonal Expansion Tumor (MSCE-T) model, we perform a theoretical analysis to determine the conditions under which Clemmesen's hook would occur. Our results show that Clemmesen's hook can be quantitatively explained by time-specific changes in the proliferative and apoptotic balance of early-stage mutated cell populations, corresponding to the decline in progesterone levels and progesterone-driven proliferation due to reduced menstrual cycles preceding menopause, and changing dominant carcinogenic impact from alternative growth pathways post-menopause (e.g., adipose-derived growth signals). In contrast, variation in last-stage clonal dynamics cannot effectively reproduce the observed non-monotonic incidence pattern. Analytical results further demonstrate that midlife incidence dynamics corresponding to the hook are governed primarily by intrinsic proliferative processes rather than detection effects. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic and mathematical explanation for Clemmesen's hook and establishes a quantitative framework linking hormonal transitions during menopause to age-specific breast cancer incidence curve."

We address this limitation by proposing \\textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches."

We introduce the notion of positive left-tail dependence under the null (PLTDN), extending classical dependence assumptions to two-sided settings, and show that it ensures valid FDR control for BH-type procedures. Building on this framework, we propose a family of generalized shifted BH (GSBH) methods that incorporate correlation information through simple p-value adjustments. Simulation results demonstrate reliable FDR control and improved power across a range of dependence structures, while an application to an HIV gene expression dataset illustrates the practical effectiveness of the proposed approach."

In this paper, we investigate this problem of prompt fairness: specifically, the phrasing of a prompt by different users/styles, despite the same question being asked in principle, may elicit different responses from an LLM. To quantify this disparity, we propose to use information-theoretic metrics that can capture two dimensions of bias: subgroup sensitivity, the variability of responses within a subgroup and cross group consistency, the variability of responses across subgroups. Our analysis reveals that certain subgroups exhibit both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others. Our empirical analysis reveals that certain demographic sub groups experience both higher internal variability and greater divergence from others, indicating structural inequities in model behavior. To mitigate these disparities, we propose practical interventions, including majority voting across multiple generations and prompt neutralization, which together improve response stability and enhance fairness across user populations. In the experiments, we observe clear prompt sensitivity disparities across demographic subgroups: before mitigation, cross-group divergence values reach 0.28 and typically fall in the from 0.14 to 0.22 range. After applying our neutralization and multi generation strategy, these divergences consistently decrease, with the largest gap reduced to 0.22 and many distances falling to 0.17 or below, indicating more stable and consistent outputs across subgroups."

In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology."

By employing the flavor SU(3) symmetry and its breaking effect, the parameters describing soft contributions are correlated and subsequently reduced into a more concise set of SU(3) parameters. Through a $χ^2$ analysis procedure applied to the experimental data, these parameters are determined, for which the corresponding theoretical results for the branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries in $B\\to PV$ decays are derived. Within this framework, it is demonstrated that the theoretical calculations align well with experimental measurements, thereby offering a solution to several long-standing puzzles.

However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel \"free-lunch\" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings."

Prior work has proposed a range of heuristics to counteract this effect, but these methods are ad hoc: they frequently trade off correctness for diversity, their effectiveness varies across tasks, and in some cases they even contradict one another. In this work, we place these observations on a rigorous foundation. We first provide a formal proof of why RL fine-tuning exhibits diversity collapse via a selection and reinforcement bias. Next, we make a key observation that any reward modification to address diversity collapse only needs to be applied on the correct trajectories. Building directly on this analysis, we introduce a principled method -- \\textit{differential smoothing} -- that provably improves both correctness and diversity, outperforming vanilla RL as well as widely used entropy-based heuristics. Our theory precisely characterizes when existing heuristics help and why they fail, while showing that differential smoothing is universally superior. Extensive experiments with models from 1B to 7B parameters, across domains including CountDown and real-world mathematical reasoning, demonstrate consistent gains.

Editing workflows revealed trade-offs: indirect editing reduced effort but introduced errors, while direct editing ensured precision but with higher workload. We conclude with design and policy implications for building safe, scalable LLM-assisted clinical communication systems."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly integrated into decision-support tools, automation workflows, and AI-enabled software systems. However, their behavior in production environments remains poorly understood, and their failure patterns differ fundamentally from those of traditional machine learning models. This paper presents a system-level taxonomy of fifteen hidden failure modes that arise in real-world LLM applications, including multi-step reasoning drift, latent inconsistency, context-boundary degradation, incorrect tool invocation, version drift, and cost-driven performance collapse. Using this taxonomy, we analyze the growing gap in evaluation and monitoring practices: existing benchmarks measure knowledge or reasoning but provide little insight into stability, reproducibility, drift, or workflow integration. We further examine the production challenges associated with deploying LLMs - including observability limitations, cost constraints, and update-induced regressions - and outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM systems. Finally, we outline high-level design principles for building reliable, maintainable, and cost-aware LLM-based systems. By framing LLM reliability as a system-engineering problem rather than a purely model-centric one, this work provides an analytical foundation for future research on evaluation methodology, AI system robustness, and dependable LLM deployment."

    "abstract": "Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.

    "abstract": "Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\\% average accuracy in state search tasks."

While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving represents a prominent application of artificial intelligence. Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets. The discriminator is trained adversarially to facilitate the transfer of long-tail handling capabilities from simulated to real-world environments by the student VLM model, using a novel backpropagation strategy."

    "abstract": "We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state."

We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe."

For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work."

Using the Einstein's field equations in metric $f(R)$ gravity we model solutions for both wormhole as well as $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole. In case of NEC satisfying matter, the associated $f(R)$ is ghost. The $f(R)$ models obtained have been independently substantiated for cosmological feasibility and valid parameter space was obtained corresponding to cosmologically viable $f(R)$. Suitable scalar-tensor representation of the corresponding $f(R)$ models have been presented using the correspondence of $f(R)$ gravity with Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity. The robustness of the wormhole solutions were further analysed with the BD scalar fields in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which showed excellent results. Lastly as an independent astrophysical probe for the wormhole we have obtained the location of their photon spheres and have connected them with the Herrera Complexity factor in $f(R).$ Our results show that the relation between the complexity factor and existence of photon spheres remains fundamentally unaltered in $f(R)$ as compared to Einstein's gravity."

We confirm that even in zero magnetic field, current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip. With a small external magnetic field, the distribution is polarized opposite to the Lorentz-force direction. These behaviors follow from the self-consistent relation between current and local field in steady flux flow. Our findings show that current history is encoded as vortices. This reveals self-field effects that influence dc measurements and glassy transitions under drive."

Results on Toronto ride-hailing data demonstrate that the proposed Frailty-Aware Cox Transformer (FACT) achieves the highest time-dependent C-indices and lowest Brier Scores, outperforming classical and deep learning survival models. This approach enables more accurate risk estimation, supports platform retention strategies, and provides policy-relevant insights."

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

It has been predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator-metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that water adsorption greatly reduces bandgap of zigzag oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water adsorbed beside the BNNR induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2 V/nm thereby reducing its bandgap. Field effect transistors were successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of zBNNRs with adsorbates of water could be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements were taken to determine the optical bandgap in zBNNR. Wider zBNNRs exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17 eV. This study yields fundamental insights in new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified framework for quantum wavelet shrinkage, extending classical denoising ideas into the quantum domain. Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage."

Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from \"visual generation\" to \"world generation.\" Our project can be found at https://yeppp27.github.io/4DWorldBench.github.io/."

    "abstract": "Data-intensive scientific workflows increasingly rely on high-performance computing (HPC) systems, complementing traditional Grid and Cloud platforms. However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution."

    "abstract": "Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences.

    "abstract": "Identifying key driver genes governing biological processes such as development and disease progression remains a challenge. While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates that TNDE outperforms existing baseline methods across diverse complex regulatory scenarios. Applied to mouse erythropoiesis data, TNDE identifies stage-specific driver genes, the functional relevance of which is corroborated by biological validation. TNDE offers an effective quantitative tool for dissecting dynamic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological processes."

    "abstract": "Data attribution seeks to trace model behavior back to the training examples that shaped it, enabling debugging, auditing, and data valuation at scale. Classical influence-function methods offer a principled foundation but remain impractical for modern networks because they require expensive backpropagation or Hessian inversion at inference. We propose a data attribution method that preserves the same first-order counterfactual target while eliminating per-query backward passes. Our approach simulates each training example's parameter influence through short-horizon gradient propagation during training and later reads out attributions for any query using only forward evaluations. This design shifts computation from inference to simulation, reflecting real deployment regimes where a model may serve billions of user queries but originate from a fixed, finite set of data sources (for example, a large language model trained on diverse corpora while compensating a specific publisher such as the New York Times). Empirically, on standard MLP benchmarks, our estimator matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines such as TRAK on standard attribution metrics (LOO and LDS) while offering orders-of-magnitude lower inference cost. By combining influence-function fidelity with first-order scalability, our method provides a theoretical framework for practical, real-time data attribution in large pretrained models."

Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived"

Utilizing a minimal low-energy Hamiltonian for the two layer system which is gapped by the intrinsic Néel order, we first employ mean-field theory to establish the conditions for exciton condensation. Our analysis identifies a nonzero, spin-singlet exciton order parameter which is tuned by external displacement field, temperature, and Coulomb attraction. Beyond the mean-field, we explore collective mode fluctuations in the uncondensed phase via many-body perturbation theory and the random phase approximation. From this, we derive the exciton spectral function which allows for a direct comparison between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. We detail how the softening of the collective mode peak is a function of the competition between interlayer detuning and thermal fluctuations. This work elucidates how the unique topological and magnetic environment of $\\text{MnBi}_2\\text{Te}_4$ offers a tunable platform for the realization and manipulation of exciton condensates and the corresponding collective excitations. Our findings contribute to understanding the interplay of topology and bosonic condensates, which could inspire application in optically accessing topological properties, dissipationless transport, and gate-tunable optoelectronics."

This sequence is a fundamental numerical invariant, as it captures the growth rate of the polynomial identities of a given algebra. Special partial classification results have been obtained, with particular interest devoted to algebras equipped with additional structure. In this paper, we consider associative G-graded algebras endowed with a graded involution. We provide a complete classification, up to equivalence, of unitary algebras with quadratic codimension growth. Our approach establishes a direct correspondence between the algebras generating minimal varieties and the nonzero multiplicities appearing in the decomposition of the proper cocharacters. As a consequence, we establish that every variety with at most quadratic growth is generated by an algebra that decomposes as a direct sum of algebras generating minimal varieties of at most quadratic growth."

To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections."

However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity."

The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline.

However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures."

Over a 15-minute period, we identify complex, superimposed spectro-temporal structures, including: (1) broadband, second-long modulation lanes with downward frequency drifts, (2) narrowband ($\\approx$ 50 MHz), short-duration S-burst envelopes with upward drifts, and (3) even narrower ($\\approx$ 10 MHz), millisecond-scale S-burst striae within these envelopes. Using the discrete Fourier transform and auto-correlation function, we identify two dominant periodic emission patterns, corresponding to the periodicities of the S-bursts ($\\approx0.1$ s) and the striae ($\\approx0.01$ s). The complex superposition of diverse time-frequency structures poses a challenge to interpreting all the emission variability as intrinsic to the source. We propose that the modulation lanes could be a propagation effect as the radio waves traverse an inhomogeneous, regularly structured plasma region in the AD Leo's magnetosphere. By modelling a plasma screen with sinusoidal phase variation in one dimension, we show that we could qualitatively reconstruct the observed modulation lanes. The origin of the finest structures, the striae, remains unclear. Our work highlights that propagation effects in the stellar magnetosphere can potentially probe kilometre-scale structures in the emission regions and provide novel constraints on density inhomogeneities caused by magnetohydrodynamic waves that are difficult to access by other means."

TTX contamination leads to food safety risks and economic losses, making early prediction of TTX contamination vital to the food industry and competent authorities. Recent studies have pointed to shallow habitats and water temperature as main drivers to TTX contamination in bivalve mollusks. However, the temporal relationships between abiotic factors, biotic factors, and TTX contamination remain unexplored. We have developed an explainable, deep learning-based model to predict TTX contamination in the Dutch Zeeland estuary. Inputs for the model were meteorological and hydrological features; output was the presence or absence of TTX contamination. Results showed that the time of sunrise, time of sunset, global radiation, water temperature, and chloride concentration contributed most to TTX contamination. Thus, the effective number of sun hours, represented by day length and global radiation, was an important driver for tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks. To conclude, our explainable deep learning model identified the aforementioned environmental factors (number of sun hours, global radiation, water temperature, and water chloride concentration) to be associated with tetrodotoxin contamination in bivalve mollusks; making our approach a valuable tool to mitigate marine toxin risks for food industry and competent authorities."

    "abstract": "Recently, path planning has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing global search capability and convergence accuracy through heuristic and learning-inspired optimization frameworks. However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments."

Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself."

Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level. Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization. Notably, our approach does not require expensive 3D labels for supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to locate the tampered 3DGS area."

Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency."

We extend a hybrid multiscale framework that couples cluster dynamics (Xolotl) with a phase-field model (MARMOT) to large 3D polycrystals with heterogeneous GB and surface diffusion and evolving GB networks. We simulate 10- and 100-grain UO$_2$ microstructures at 1200 and 1600 K, with and without a FS, to interrogate bubble growth, coalescence, GB/TJ coverage, gas arrival at interfaces, and fission gas release (FGR). At 1200 K, both GB mobility and gas transport are low, yielding negligible bubble and GB evolution. At 1600 K, intergranular bubbles rapidly become lenticular and coalesce into networks while unpinned GBs migrate; fewer initial bubbles reduce coalescence but enhance GB migration due to less pinning and produce spikes in interfacial gas arrival rate due to GB sweeping. Bubble density versus mean projected area agrees with White's (2004) coalescence trend and remains on the left side of the analytical curve, in contrast to several prior simulations, likely due to the inclusion of GB migration. In domains with a FS, early release is rapid and bubbles near the FS collapse to form a denuded zone, suppressing local network connectivity; GB coverage rises and approaches but does not exceed 50%. TJ coverage remains low without preferential nucleation at TJs. To our knowledge, these are the first large-scale 3D mesoscale simulations of intergranular fission gas behavior that provide mechanistic insight and quantitative metrics to inform engineering-scale FGR models."

    "abstract": "End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream\" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents."

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we extend the recently introduced theory of stochastic modified equations (SMEs) for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms. In Ch. 3 we study time-inhomogeneous SDEs driven by Brownian motion. For certain SDEs we prove a 1st and 2nd-order weak approximation properties, and we compute their linear error terms explicitly, under certain regularity conditions. In Ch. 4 we instantiate our results for SGD, working out the example of linear regression explicitly. We use this example to compare the linear error terms of gradient flow and two commonly used 1st-order SMEs for SGD in Ch. 5. In the second part of the thesis we introduce and study a novel diffusion approximation for SGD without replacement (SGDo) in the finite-data setting. In Ch. 6 we motivate and define the notion of an epoched Brownian motion (EBM). We argue that Young differential equations (YDEs) driven by EBMs serve as continuous-time models for SGDo for any shuffling scheme whose induced permutations converge to a det. permuton. Further, we prove a.s. convergence for these YDEs in the strongly convex setting. Moreover, we compute an upper asymptotic bound on the convergence rate which is as sharp as, or better than previous results for SGDo. In Ch. 7 we study scaling limits of families of random walks (RW) that share the same increments up to a random permutation. We show weak convergence under the assumption that the sequence of permutations converges to a det. (higher-dimensional) permuton. This permuton determines the covariance function of the limiting Gaussian process. Conversely, we show that every Gaussian process with a covariance function determined by a permuton in this way arises as a weak scaling limit of families of RW with shared increments. Finally, we apply our weak convergence theory to show that EBMs arise as scaling limits of RW with finitely many distinct increments."

These lattices have rank $3n-1$, and we show that their minimum distance equals $\\sqrt{2n}$, thereby exceeding the classical bound $\\sqrt{2γ(F_n)} = \\sqrt{2(n-1)}$. We also determine their kissing number, which turns out to be independent of $n$, and analyze the structure of the second shortest vectors.

First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, establishing a reliable foundation for security analysis. Using this high-fidelity foundation, however, we expose a more fundamental flaw in practice: downstream vulnerability scanners produce a staggering 97.5\\% false positive rate. We pinpoint the primary cause as the flagging of vulnerabilities within unreachable code. We then demonstrate that function call analysis can effectively prune 63.3\\% of these false alarms. Our work validates a practical, two-stage approach for SSC security: first, generate an accurate SBOM using lock files and strong package managers, and second, enrich it with function call analysis to produce actionable, low-noise vulnerability reports that alleviate developers' alert fatigue."

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction. This suggests that human-robot interactions should be designed to allow humans to leverage their natural capabilities for detecting biological motion, which conversely may reduce the need for costly robotic computations or added cognitive adaptation on the human side."

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly applied to tasks requiring structured reasoning, tool use, and environmental adaptation, such as data manipulation, multistep planning, and computer-use automation. However, despite their versatility, current training paradigms for model weight optimization methods, like PPO and GRPO, remain relatively impractical with their high computational overhead for rollout convergence. In addition, the resulting agent policies are difficult to interpret, adapt, or incrementally improve. To address this, we investigate creating and refining structured memory of experiential learning of an agent from its environment as an alternative route to agent optimization. We introduce BREW (Bootstrapping expeRientially-learned Environmental knoWledge), a framework for agent optimization for downstream tasks via KB construction and refinement. In our formulation, we introduce an effective method for partitioning agent memory for more efficient retrieval and refinement. BREW uses task graders and behavior rubrics to learn insights while leveraging state-space search for ensuring robustness from the noise and non-specificity in natural language. Empirical results on real world, domain-grounded benchmarks -- OSWorld, $τ^2$Bench, and SpreadsheetBench -- show BREW achieves $10-20\\%$ improvement in task precision, $10-15\\%$ reduction in API/tool calls leading to faster execution time, all while maintaining computational efficiency on par with base models. Unlike prior work where memory is treated as static context, we establish the KB as a modular and controllable substrate for agent optimization -- an explicit lever for shaping behavior in a transparent, interpretable, and extensible manner."

Specifically, data deletion, a core component of machine unlearning, faces three critical challenges in learned CE models: attribute-level sensitivity, inter-table propagation and domain disappearance leading to severe overestimation in multi-way joins. We propose Cardinality Estimation Pruning (CEP), the first unlearning framework specifically designed for multi-table learned CE systems. CEP introduces Distribution Sensitivity Pruning, which constructs semi-join deletion results and computes sensitivity scores to guide parameter pruning, and Domain Pruning, which removes support for value domains entirely eliminated by deletion. We evaluate CEP on state-of-the-art architectures NeuroCard and FACE across IMDB and TPC-H datasets. Results demonstrate CEP consistently achieves the lowest Q-error in multi-table scenarios, particularly under high deletion ratios, often outperforming full retraining. Furthermore, CEP significantly reduces convergence iterations, incurring negligible computational overhead of 0.3%-2.5% of fine-tuning time."

In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered."

Specifically, we introduce a multimodal chain-of-thought (MM-CoT) process that refines prompts based on feedback from physical inconsistencies, progressively enhancing generation quality. This method is training-free and plug-and-play, making it readily applicable to a wide range of video generation models. Experiments on the PhyIQ benchmark show that our method improves the Physics-IQ score from 56.31 to 62.38.

The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations."

Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals."

Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU.

Aluminum oxide has typically been used as the tunnel barrier.

In this paper, we report the first demonstration of α-Ta/insulating TaN/a-Ta superconductor/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions fabricated on 300 mm wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. The junctions were fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates using standard processes available at 300 mm scale, including 193 nm optical lithography, ALD of TaN in a cluster tool, and chemical mechanical planarization to enable highly planar interfaces. Junction areas ranging from 0.03 um2 to 9 um2 with ALD TaN thickness between 2 nm and 7 nm were characterized. A critical current density of 76 uA/um2 was observed in junctions using 4 nm ALD TaN in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of Jc on ALD TaN layer thickness is analyzed, and the influence of junction geometry, packaging, and temperature on I-V characteristics is discussed. Junctions were retested after a period of 4 months to quantify junction aging. The potential of this novel material system and a 300 mm superconducting junction process flow to fabricate thermally and environmentally stable junctions is discussed. The vision of a Superconducting Quantum Process Design Kit for a Multi-Project Wafer program to enable rapid development and proliferation of superconducting quantum and digital digital logic systems is presented.

To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

    "abstract": "Gossip has been shown to be a relatively efficient solution to problems of cooperation in reputation-based systems of exchange, but many studies don't conceptualize gossiping in a realistic way, often assuming near-perfect information or broadcast-like dynamics of its spread. To solve this problem, we developed an agent-based model that pairs realistic gossip processes with different variants of Trust Game. The results show that cooperators suffer when local interactions govern spread of gossip, because they cannot discriminate against defectors. Realistic gossiping increases the overall amount of resources, but is more likely to promote defection. Moreover, even partner selection through dynamic networks can lead to high payoff inequalities among agent types. Cooperators face a choice between outcompeting defectors and overall growth. By blending direct and indirect reciprocity with reputations we show that gossiping increases the efficiency of cooperation by an order of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Digital holographic microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing transparent and reflective phase objects. Its ability to reconstruct amplitude and phase can also offer great insight into wavefront shaping and design of all-dielectric optical metasurfaces. While metasurfaces have reached widespread popularity, their design is often based purely on the results of numerical simulations which can overlook many of the real-world fabrication imperfections. Being able to verify the real phase response of a fabricated device is of great utility for high-performance devices. Here, we use holographic microscopy to validate metalibraries of rectangular TiO2 and Si building blocks. Illumination effects are studied for wavelengths from 600 to 740 nm and linear polarization rotating within the full range of unique states (0 to 180deg). Finally, by varying the numerical aperture of the condenser lens from 0.05 to 0.5 we also study the effects of an off-axis illumination. Comparing the experimental results with simulations from finite-difference time-domain and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, we highlight the limitations of these theoretical predictions and underscore the utility of an experimentally established library of building blocks. We demonstrate that our proposed method of holographic microscopy is both practical and effective for creating a metalibrary that accounts for all fabrication and material imperfections, which is crucial for designing high-efficiency metasurfaces."

However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions."

This limitation leads to incomplete retrieval and compromises the generator's ability to produce accurate and comprehensive answers. To bridge this gap, we propose HKRAG, a new holistic RAG framework designed to explicitly capture and integrate both knowledge types. Our framework features two key components: (1) a Hybrid Masking-based Holistic Retriever that employs explicit masking strategies to separately model salient and fine-print knowledge, ensuring a query-relevant holistic information retrieval; and (2) an Uncertainty-guided Agentic Generator that dynamically assesses the uncertainty of initial answers and actively decides how to integrate the two distinct knowledge streams for optimal response generation. Extensive experiments on open-domain visual question answering benchmarks show that HKRAG consistently outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating the critical importance of holistic knowledge retrieval for VRD understanding."

    "abstract": "In critical web applications such as e-commerce and recommendation systems, multimodal graphs integrating rich visual and textual attributes are increasingly central, yet their large scale introduces substantial computational burdens for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). While Graph Condensation (GC) offers a promising solution by synthesizing smaller datasets, existing methods falter in the multimodal setting. We identify a dual challenge causing this failure: (1) conflicting gradients arising from semantic misalignments between modalities, and (2) the GNN's message-passing architecture pathologically amplifying this gradient noise across the graph structure. To address this, we propose Structurally-Regularized Gradient Matching (SR-GM), a novel condensation framework tailored for multimodal graphs. SR-GM introduces two synergistic components: first, a gradient decoupling mechanism that resolves inter-modality conflicts at their source via orthogonal projection; and second, a structural damping regularizer that acts directly on the gradient field. By leveraging the graph's Dirichlet energy, this regularizer transforms the topology from a noise amplifier into a stabilizing force during optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SR-GM significantly improves accuracy and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods. Ablation studies confirm that addressing both gradient conflict and structural amplification in tandem is essential for achieving superior performance. Moreover, the condensed multimodal graphs exhibit strong cross-architecture generalization and promise to accelerate applications like Neural Architecture Search. This research provides a scalable methodology for multimodal graph-based learning in resource-constrained environments."

We focus on designing a novel, communication-efficient algorithm that still yields accurate trained models. To this end, we employ several mechanisms to reduce the number of communications with the ground station (local training) and their size (compression). We then propose an error feedback mechanism that enhances accuracy, which yields, as a byproduct, an algorithm-agnostic error feedback scheme that can be more broadly applied. We analyze the convergence of the resulting algorithm, and compare it with the state of the art through simulations in a realistic space scenario, showcasing superior performance."

To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems."

The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art."

    "abstract": "Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules."

This yields a decoupled optimization strategy for the parameter selection that is more efficient and scalable than the direct maximum likelihood maximization. The proposed approach is compared to other multi-fidelity models, and benchmarks for different application cases of increasing complexity are provided."

We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA to predict 1.3 million mental-health self-reports from 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings recorded in 9,000 online participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, generalizes across contexts, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. The model translates from general to clinical populations, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and captures signatures of psychological function that are not conveyed by language. Our results demonstrate how everyday human-computer interactions can power passive, reliable, dynamic, and maximally scalable mental health assessments. The ability to decode mental states at zero marginal cost sets new benchmarks for precision medicine and public health, while raising important questions about privacy, agency, and autonomy online."

Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a \"motion edit\" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating \"motion counterfactuals\", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

Recent advances in optimizers have improved convergence efficiency through momentum orthogonalization, but suffer from two key robustness limitations: dimensional fragility in orthogonalization precision and vulnerability to outlier-induced noise. To address these robustness challenges, we introduce ROOT, a Robust Orthogonalized Optimizer that enhances training stability through dual robustness mechanisms. First, we develop a dimension-robust orthogonalization scheme using adaptive Newton iterations with fine-grained coefficients tailored to specific matrix sizes, ensuring consistent precision across diverse architectural configurations. Second, we introduce an optimization-robust framework via proximal optimization that suppresses outlier noise while preserving meaningful gradient directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROOT achieves significantly improved robustness, with faster convergence and superior final performance compared to both Muon and Adam-based optimizers, particularly in noisy and non-convex scenarios.

An analysis of the temperature-dependent carrier density between 300 and 920 K yields two activation energies associated with intrinsic conduction: 0.15 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.02/+0.10 eV), which we attribute to the fundamental bandgap, and 0.50 eV (with an uncertainty of -0.05/+0.15 eV) representing a higher energy transition."

Our method leverages Gaussian process (GP) priors for spatially varying intercept and slope. To improve computational efficiency under a large number of spatial locations, we implemented a Hilbert space low-rank approximation of the GP. We modeled the baseline hazard curves as piecewise constant, and introduced a novel multiplicative gamma process prior to induce shrinkage and smoothing. A loss-based clustering method was then used on the spatial random effects to identify high-risk regions. We demonstrate the utility of this method through simulation and a real-world analysis of EHR data from Duke Hospital to study readmission risk of elderly patients with upper extremity fractures. Our results showed that the proposed method improved inference efficiency and provided valuable insights for downstream policy decisions."

In this work, we introduce a variational bagging approach that integrates a bagging procedure with variational Bayes, resulting in a bagged variational posterior for improved inference. We establish strong theoretical guarantees, including posterior contraction rates for general models and a Bernstein-von Mises (BVM) type theorem that ensures valid uncertainty quantification. Notably, our results show that even when using a mean-field variational family, our approach can recover off-diagonal elements of the limiting covariance structure and provide proper uncertainty quantification. In addition, variational bagging is robust to model misspecification, with covariance structures matching those of the target covariance. We illustrate our variational bagging method in numerical studies through applications to parametric models, finite mixture models, deep neural networks, and variational autoencoders (VAEs)."

    "abstract": "Near-field (NF) communications is receiving renewed interest in the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involving large physical apertures with respect to the signal wavelength. While line-of-sight (LOS) links are typically expected to dominate in NF scenarios, the impact of non-LOS (NLOS) components at both in centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequencies may be in general non-negligible. Moreover, although weaker than the LOS path, NLOS links may be essential for achieving multiplexing gains in MIMO systems. The commonly used NF channel models for NLOS links in the literature are based on the point scattering assumption, which is not valid for large reflectors such as walls, ceilings, and the ground. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF MIMO channel model that extends the widely adopted point scattering framework to account for imperfect reflections from large surfaces. This model is then leveraged to investigate how the physical characteristics of these reflectors influence the resulting NF MIMO channel. In addition, using the proposed channel model, we analytically demonstrate for a multi-user scenario that, even when users are located within the NF regime, relying solely on LOS NF links may be insufficient to achieve multiplexing gains, thus exploiting NLOS links becomes essential. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed model and show that, in many practical settings, the contribution of NLOS components is non-negligible and must be carefully accounted for in the system design."

    "abstract": "The abundance of fine-grained spatio-temporal data, such as traffic sensor networks, offers vast opportunities for scientific discovery. However, inferring causal relationships from such observational data remains challenging, particularly due to unobserved confounders that are specific to units (e.g., geographical locations) yet influence outcomes over time. Most existing methods for spatio-temporal causal inference assume that all confounders are observed, an assumption that is often violated in practice. In this paper, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs), a novel graphical framework that extends hierarchical causal modeling to the spatio-temporal domain. At the core of our approach is the Spatio-Temporal Collapse Theorem, which shows that a complex ST-HCM converges to a simpler flat causal model as the amount of subunit data increases. This theoretical result enables a general procedure for causal identification, allowing ST-HCMs to recover causal effects even in the presence of unobserved, time-invariant unit-level confounders, a scenario where standard non-hierarchical models fail. We validate the effectiveness of our framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its potential for robust causal inference in complex dynamic systems."

Therefore, we contribute a framework for verified numerical methods in Isabelle/HOL based on ITrees. Our user-friendly specification language enables the direct declaration of numerical programs that can be annotated with variants and invariants for reasoning about correctness specifications. The generated verification conditions can be discharged via automated proof methods and lemmas from the HOL-Analysis library. The ITrees foundation interacts with Isabelle's code generator to export source code. This provides an end-to-end path from formal specifications with machine-checked guarantees to executable sources. We illustrate the process of modelling numerical methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the verification by focusing on two well-known methods, the bisection method and the fixed-point iteration method. We also contribute crucial extensions to the libraries of formalised mathematics required for this objective: higher-order derivatives and Taylor's theorem in Peano form. Finally, we qualitatively evaluate the use of the framework for verifying numerical methods."

By measuring the $D_1$ transition energies in Na- and Mg-like charge states of Lu and Yb confined in the Tokyo electron-beam ion trap, we extract meV-level energy shifts that are directly sensitive to nuclear-size effects. Transition-energy differences obtained from these spectra are compared with state-of-the-art relativistic many-body perturbation theory, including a new treatment of Mg-like ions. We develop a generalized framework to propagate uncertainties arising from nuclear deformation and surface diffuseness and evaluate corresponding nuclear-sensitivity coefficients. Combining Na- and Mg-like results yields mutually consistent radius differences, demonstrating the robustness of both the experimental calibration and the theoretical predictions. To determine absolute isotopic radii, we perform a generalized least-squares optimization incorporating our HCI constraints together with optical-isotope-shift data and muonic-atom results. This analysis establishes that the $^{175}$Lu charge radius is smaller than that of $^{174}$Yb, restoring the expected odd-even staggering across the $N=94$ isotonic chain. Our recommended value, $R(^{175}\\text{Lu}) = 5.291(11)$ fm, reduces the uncertainty of the Lu radius by a factor of three compared with the previous electron-scattering result and resolves a long-standing anomaly in rare-earth nuclear systematics. This work demonstrates that EUV spectroscopy of HCIs provides a powerful and broadly applicable method for precision nuclear-structure studies in heavy, deformed nuclei. The techniques developed here enable future investigations of isotonic and isoelectronic sequences, including radioactive nuclides and higher-$Z$ systems."

Through a series of systematic ablations on vision and language modelling tasks, we demonstrate that the conventional wisdom surrounding bias correction is misleading. In particular, we demonstrate that in the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, the inclusion of bias correction leads to no improvement in final test performance. Moreover, unless appropriate learning rate scheduling is implemented, the inclusion of bias correction can sometimes be detrimental to performance. We further reinterpret bias correction as a form of implicit learning rate scheduling whose behaviour is strongly dependent on the choice of smoothing hyper-parameters $β_1, β_2 \\in [0,1)$. Our findings challenge the universal inclusion of this component."

The success of octave-spanning optical frequency combs in down-converting ultrastable optical frequency references has motivated the development of compact, robust and highly manufacturable optical systems that maintain the ultralow microwave phase noise of their tabletop counterparts. Two-point optical frequency division using chip-scale components and ~1 THz-spanning microcombs has been quite successful, but with stringent requirements on the comb source's free-running noise and feedback control dynamics. Here we introduce a major simplification of this architecture that replaces feedback control of the frequency comb in favor of electronic feedforward noise cancelation that significantly relaxes the comb requirements. Demonstrated with both a high repetition rate solid-state mode-locked laser and a microcomb, feedforward on a 10 GHz carrier results in more robust operation with phase noise as low as -153 dBc/Hz at offsets >10 kHz, femtosecond timing jitter, and elimination of the large \"servo bump\" noise increase at high offset frequency. The system's compatibility with a variety of highly manufacturable mode-locked laser designs and its resilience and straightforward implementation represents an important step forward towards a fully chip-scale implementation of optically generated microwaves, with applications in radar, sensing, and position, navigation and timing."

We propose that Continuum Percolation is uniquely suited for this support analysis, as the sampling process effectively projects high-dimensional density estimation onto a geometric counting problem on the support. In this work, we establish a rigorous isomorphism between the topological phase transitions of Random Geometric Graphs and the underlying data manifold in high-dimensional space. By analyzing the relationship between our proposed Percolation Shift metric and FID, we demonstrate that our metric captures structural pathologies (such as implicit mode collapse) where statistical metrics fail. Finally, we translate this topological phenomenon into a differentiable loss function to guide training. Experimental results confirm that this approach not only prevents manifold shrinkage but drives the model toward a state of \"Hyper-Generalization,\" achieving good fidelity and verified topological expansion."

This interpretation is supported by the temporal proximity of the NICER observation to the detection of a carbon superburst by the X-ray monitor MAXI, suggesting that the presence of the line is associated with this rare and extreme event. From the inferred redshift of the absorption line, the compactness of the neutron star can be derived. Using a photoionization absorption model, we measure a gravitational redshift of about 1.72, which corresponds to a compactness R/M of 4.46 \\pm 0.13 km per solar mass, or 3.02 \\pm 0.09 in dimensionless units. This unique feature highlights the importance of further observations and detailed modelling, offering promising insights into the equation of state of matter under extreme density conditions."

Here, we explore how shift current (SC) and magnetic ballistic current (MBC) evolve and emerge in AB-stacked Bernal bilayer graphene subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. We find that the SC responds only mildly to weak fields, behaving as an almost even function of field strength. In contrast, the MBC is activated directly by TRS breaking and grows linearly with weak fields at selected photon energies. Focusing on AB-bilayer graphene ribbon we investigate the behavior of SC and MBC under both weak and strong vertical fields. We uncover the strikingly opposite roles played by edge states in the SC: under weak fields these highly localized, sublattice- and layer-polarized edge modes are essentially dark, yet under strong fields - when Landau levels dominate - the same edge states swell in spatial extent and become intensely bright contributors to the SC response."

Using data on access to Local Anti-Violence Centers in the Apulia region from 2021 to 2024, we investigate the impact of municipality-level socioeconomic characteristics and local vulnerabilities on both the incidence and reporting of gender-based violence. To explicitly account for spatial dependence, we compare four spatial models within the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation framework for Bayesian model estimation. We assess the relative fit of the competing models, discussing their prior assumptions, spatial confounding effects, and inferential implications. Our findings indicate that access to support services decreases with distance from the residential municipality, highlighting spatial constraints in reporting and the strategic importance of support center location. Furthermore, lower education levels appear to contribute to under-reporting in disadvantaged areas, while higher economic development may be associated with a lower incidence of reported violence.

Scintillation imaging dosimetry shows potential to address several of these limitations. Here, translation to conventional photon external beam radiotherapy was examined using a novel wide-area imaging and sensing technique. Methods: A modular scintillator array was combined with a dual-camera stereovision system for 3D localization and a clinical Cherenkov imaging system for optical scintillation detection. Water equivalent thickness, dose linearity, repetition rate stability, and angular dependence were characterized. Field edge detection was evaluated against radiochromic film using gamma analysis. System reproducibility was tested with consecutive deliveries simulating contralateral breast monitoring during whole-breast tangential radiotherapy. Results: The array showed high dose linearity across the tested range, minimal beam perturbation, and consistent response within 5% across all available LINAC repetition rates. Dose-normalized scintillation varied within 5% over clinically relevant gantry angles, and camera angle corrections compensated for non-Lambertian emission. Field edge detection agreed closely with film, with a 99.98% gamma pass rate (3%/3 mm). Inter-delivery reproducibility of +/-1 cGy demonstrated robust system performance. Conclusion: The conformable scintillator array imaging system provides spatially resolved, dynamic surface dosimetry with minimal workflow impact. Its ability to generate continuous dose maps across complex anatomical surfaces, while maintaining angular correction, addresses key limitations of current in vivo dosimetry and shows strong potential for clinical integration where wide-area surface dosimetry is required."

    "abstract": "Constrained radial basis function (RBF) regression has recently emerged as a powerful meshless tool for reconstructing continuous velocity fields from scattered flow measurements, particularly in image-based velocimetry. However, existing formulations based on isotropic kernels often suffer from spurious oscillations in regions with sharp gradients or strong flow anisotropy. This work introduces an anisotropic, gradient-informed, and adaptively sampled extension of the constrained RBF framework for regression of scattered data. Gradient information is estimated via local polynomial regression at collocation points, smoothed, and used to (1) re-sample data, maximizing sampling density near steep gradients while downsampling in smooth regions, and (2) construct a local anisotropic metric that shapes each basis function according to the flow directionality. In addition, a gradient-informed regularization is introduced by embedding observed gradients into the least-squares system as weighted soft constraints. The resulting formulation is fully meshless, linear, and computationally efficient, while significantly improving reconstruction quality in challenging regions. The method is evaluated on both synthetic and experimental datasets, including direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of a turbulent channel and time-resolved particle tracking velocimetry of a turbulent jet. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms isotropic and gradient-free RBF formulations in accuracy, smoothness, and physical consistency -- particularly near shear layers and boundaries -- while reducing the number of bases by an order of magnitude. To support the application, we have created a repository (https://github.com/mendezVKI/SPICY_VKI) that provides access to the investigated datasets."

    "abstract": "Thermal modeling of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is challenging due to steep, rapidly moving thermal gradients induced by the laser, which are difficult to resolve accurately with conventional Finite Element Methods. Highly refined, dynamically adaptive spatial discretization is typically required, leading to prohibitive computational costs. Semi-analytical approaches mitigate this by decomposing the temperature field into an analytical point-source solution and a complementary numerical field that enforces boundary conditions. However, state-of-the-art implementations either necessitate extensive mesh refinement near boundaries or rely on restrictive image source techniques, limiting their efficiency and applicability to complex geometries. This study presents a novel reformulation of the semi-analytical framework using Isogeometric Analysis. The laser heat input is captured by the analytical point-source solution, while the complementary correction field, which imposes boundary conditions, is solved using a spline-based IGA discretization. The governing heat equation for the correction field is cast in a weak form, discretized with NURBS basis functions, and advanced in time using an implicit $θ$-scheme. This approach leverages IGA's key advantages: exact geometry representation, higher-order continuity, and superior accuracy per degree of freedom. These features unlock efficient thermal modeling of realistic parts with complex contours. Our strategy eliminates the need for scan-wise remeshing and robustly handles intricate geometric features like sharp corners and varying cross-sections. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed semi-analytical IGA method delivers accurate temperature predictions and achieves substantial computational efficiency gains compared to standard FEM, establishing it as a powerful new tool for high-fidelity thermal simulation in LPBF."

    "abstract": "The first four-dimensional amplitude analysis of the B+ -> psi(2S) KS0 pi+ decay is performed with proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb-1. The data cannot be fully explained by B+ -> psi(2S) K*+ contributions alone. A significantly better description of the data is obtained by adding a T_ccbar+ contribution decaying to psi(2S) pi+. The properties of the T_ccbar+ structure are consistent with the exotic state T_ccbar1(4430)+ reported in the isospin-related B0bar -> psi(2S) K- pi+ decay. Effects of a possible T_ccbar1(4430)+ -> D1*(2600)0bar D+ decay mode on the T_ccbar1(4430)+ -> psi(2S) pi+ mass distribution are investigated through a Flatte parametrization, providing constraints on the relative decay strength. A description of the T_ccbar1(4430)+ structure using the triangle singularity mechanism is studied and also found to be consistent with the data."

    "abstract": "Automatic Pitch Correction (APC) enhances vocal recordings by aligning pitch deviations with the intended musical notes. However, existing APC systems either rely on reference pitches, which limits their practical applicability, or employ simple pitch estimation algorithms that often fail to preserve expressiveness and naturalness. We propose BERT-APC, a novel reference-free APC framework that corrects pitch errors while maintaining the natural expressiveness of vocal performances. In BERT-APC, a novel stationary pitch predictor first estimates the perceived pitch of each note from the detuned singing voice. A context-aware note pitch predictor estimates the intended pitch sequence by leveraging a music language model repurposed to incorporate musical context. Finally, a note-level correction algorithm fixes pitch errors while preserving intentional pitch deviations for emotional expression. In addition, we introduce a learnable data augmentation strategy that improves the robustness of the music language model by simulating realistic detuning patterns. Compared to two recent singing voice transcription models, BERT-APC demonstrated superior performance in note pitch prediction, outperforming the second-best model, ROSVOT, by 10.49%p on highly detuned samples in terms of the raw pitch accuracy. In the MOS test, BERT-APC achieved the highest score of $4.32 \\pm 0.15$, which is significantly higher than those of the widely-used commercial APC tools, AutoTune ($3.22 \\pm 0.18$) and Melodyne ($3.08 \\pm 0.18$), while maintaining a comparable ability to preserve expressive nuances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first APC model that leverages a music language model to achieve reference-free pitch correction with symbolic musical context. The corrected audio samples of BERT-APC are available online."

    "abstract": "In the paper, we develop spectral theory to analyze the sharp asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Boltzmann equation around global Maxwellians in a three-dimensional infinite layer $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times (-1,1)$. The isothermal diffuse reflection boundary condition is imposed on two parallel infinite planes at $x_3=\\pm 1$. The main difficulties lie in the fact that the direct Fourier transform is not applicable to the vertical $x_3$-variable, and the linear collision operator $K$ loses its compactness on $L^2((-1,1)\\times \\R^3_v)$ although it is compact on $L^2(\\R^3_v)$. By introducing a regularization operator $K_n$ via the finite-dimensional Fourier series truncation in $L^2(-1,1)$, we study the spectrum of the linearized initial-boundary value approximation problem, establish the resolvent estimates, and identify the leading diffusive eigenvalue. This spectral structure governs the sharp asymptotic dynamics of the original linear problem as $n\\to \\infty$, enabling us to construct the large-time behavior for the nonlinear problem and rigorously prove that the solution converges with a faster rate toward that of the two-dimensional heat equation in the horizontal direction."

    "abstract": "Biological information processing often arises from mesoscopic molecular systems operating far from equilibrium, yet their complexity can make the underlying principles difficult to visualize. In this study, we introduce a macroscopic hydraulic model that serves as an intuitive analog for the molecular switching behavior exhibited by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell membrane. The hydraulic system reproduces the essential structural and functional features of the molecular switch, including the presence of up to three distinct steady state solutions, the characteristic shapes of these solutions, and the physical interpretation of the control parameters governing the behavior of the system. By mapping water flow, energy barrier height, and siphoning dynamics onto biochemical flux, activation energy, and state transitions, the model provides a transparent representation of the mechanisms that regulate GPCR activation. The correspondence between the hydraulic analog and the molecular system suggests several experimentally testable hypotheses about GPCR function. In particular, the model highlights the central role of energy flux, driven by imbalances in ATP/ADP or GTP/GDP concentrations, in activating the molecular switch and maintaining nonequilibrium signaling states. It also identifies two key parameters that primarily determine switch behavior: the energy difference between the active and inactive states and the effective height of the energy barrier that separates them. These results imply that GPCR signaling dynamics may be governed by generalizable physical principles rather than by biochemical details alone. The hydraulic framework thus offers a tractable platform for interpreting complex molecular behavior and may aid in the development of predictive models of GPCR function in diverse physiological contexts."

Applications range from cognitive analyses over user/behavior modeling, adaptation, recommendations, to (user/bot) identification/verification. That is, research on these applications - in particular those relying on learned models - require copious amounts of structured data for both training and evaluation. Different application domains thereby impose different requirements. I.e., for some purposes it is vital that the data is based on a guided interaction process, meaning that monitored subjects pursued a given task, while other purposes require additional context information, such as widget interactions or metadata. Unfortunately, the amount of publicly available datasets is small and their respective applicability for specific purposes limited. We present GUIDEd Interaction DATA (GUIDAETA) - a new dataset, collected from a large-scale guided user study with more than 250 users, each working on three pre-defined information retrieval tasks using a custom-built consumer information system. Besides being larger than most comparable datasets - with 716 completed tasks, 2.39 million mouse and keyboard events (2.35 million and 40 thousand, respectively) and a total observation period of almost 50 hours - its interactions exhibit encompassing context information in the form of widget information, triggered (system) events and associated displayed content. Combined with extensive metadata such as sociodemographic user data and answers to explicit feedback questionnaires (regarding perceived usability, experienced cognitive load, pre-knowledge on the information system's topic), GUIDAETA constitutes a versatile dataset, applicable for various research domains and purposes."

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching."

In this framework, particles and fields are treated simultaneously within a single presymplectic manifold, and the Gotay-Nester-Hinds algorithm recovers the full Maxwell-Vlasov equations as the compatibility conditions of a single variational system. The hierarchy of constraints -- including Vlasov advection, Gauss and Faraday laws, and the electromagnetic gauge structure -- arises naturally from the presymplectic geometry of the SR formalism. Reduction by the diffeomorphism group of phase space produces a reduced presymplectic manifold whose dynamics reproduces both the Euler-Poincare formulation for the Vlasov sector and the Marsden-Weinstein/Morrison-Greene Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structure. We further extend the construction to equilibria that partially break the relabeling symmetry, obtaining a translated SR system that yields an effective symplectic linearization, clarifies the appearance of Goldstone-type neutral modes, and provides a geometric foundation for the energy-Casimir method. Finally, we incorporate external antenna fields into this setting by introducing affine Hamiltonian controls and establishing a theory of controlled symmetry breaking within the reduced SR framework. This leads to controlled Lie-Poisson equations for plasma-antenna coupling and a geometric mechanism for stabilization through Casimir shaping and symmetry-selective forcing. The resulting picture provides a single presymplectic structure that unifies Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, gauge, reduction, and control-theoretic aspects of the Maxwell-Vlasov system."

A fundamental challenge in this paradigm lies in the modality gap -- the structural and semantic disconnect between provenance graphs and CTI reports. Prior work addresses this by framing threat hunting as a graph matching task: 1) extracting attack graphs from CTI reports, and 2) aligning them with provenance graphs. However, this pipeline incurs severe \\textit{information loss} during graph extraction and demands intensive manual curation, undermining scalability and effectiveness. In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention. First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility. Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world APT datasets demonstrate that APT-CGLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art threat hunting baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency."

We address this issue through the lens of quantum estimation theory. A distinctive feature of neutrino oscillation experiments is that they cannot freely optimize the probe or measurement, since both are constrained by the production and detection of flavor eigenstates. We therefore examine whether the large uncertainty in $δ_{CP}$ originates from intrinsic reasons, either of the neutrino quantum state or of flavor measurements, or if it instead stems from experimental limitations. By comparing quantum and classical Fisher information, we demonstrate that the limited sensitivity to $δ_{CP}$ originates primarily from the information content of flavor measurements. Furthermore, we show that targeting the second oscillation maximum, as in the ESS$ν$SB proposal, substantially enhances $δ_{CP}$ information compared to experiments centered on the first maximum."

The proposed \\emph{General Multi-User Distributed Computing (GMUDC)} model characterizes how computation, communication, and accuracy can be jointly optimized when users demand heterogeneous target functions that are arbitrary transformations of shared real-valued subfunctions. Without any separability assumption, and requiring only that each target function lies in a reproducing-kernel Hilbert space associated with a shift-invariant kernel, the framework remains valid for arbitrary connectivity and task-assignment topologies. A dual analysis is introduced: the \\emph{quenched design} considers fixed assignments of subfunctions and network topology, while the \\emph{annealed design} captures the averaged performance when assignments and links are drawn uniformly at random from a given ensemble. These formulations reveal the fundamental limits governing the trade-offs among computing load, communication load, and reconstruction distortion under computational and communication budgets~$Γ$ and~$Δ$. The analysis establishes a spectral-coverage duality linking generalization capability with network topology and resource allocation, leading to provably efficient and topology-aware distributed designs. The resulting principles provide an \\emph{information-energy foundation} for scalable and resource-optimal distributed and federated learning systems, with direct applications to aeronautical, satellite, and edge-intelligent networks where energy and data efficiency are critical."

A widely studied category of topological indices, known as degree-based topological indices, are calculated as the sum of the weights of a graph's edges, where each edge weight is determined by a formula that depends solely on the degrees of its endpoints. This work focuses exclusively on chemical graphs in which no vertex has a degree greater than 3, a model for conjugated systems. Within a polyhedral framework, each chemical graph is mapped to a point in a three-dimensional space, enabling extremal values of any degree-based topological index to be determined through linear optimization over the corresponding polyhedron. Analysis within this framework reveals that extremality is limited to a small subset of chemical graph families, implying that certain chemical graphs can never attain extremality for any degree-based topological index. The main objective of this paper is to present ChemicHull, an online tool we have developed to determine and display extremal chemical graphs for arbitrary degree-based topological indices. To illustrate the power of this tool, we easily recover established results, emphasizing its effectiveness for chemically significant graph classes such as chemical trees and unicyclic chemical graphs. This tool also enabled the identification of a counterexample to a previously published extremal result concerning the Randić index."

This is a generalization of the chromatic number for undirected graphs as a graph has chromatic number at most $k$ if and only if the complete biorientation of $G$ (replace each edge by a directed 2-cycle) has dichromatic number at most $k$. In this paper we introduce the acyclic dichromatic number $\\vecχ_{\\rm a}(D)$ of a digraph $D$ as the minimum number of sets in a partition $V_1,\\ldots{},V_k$ of $V$ so that the induced subdigraph $D[V_i]$ is acyclic for each $i\\in [k]$ and each of the bipartite induced subdigraphs $D[V_i,V_j]$ is acyclic for each $1\\leq i<j\\leq k$. This parameter, which resembles the definition of acyclic chromatic number for undirected graphs, has apparently not been studied before. We derive a number of results which display the difference between the dichromatic number and the acyclic dichromatic number, in particular, there are digraphs $D$ with arbitrarily large $\\vecχ_{\\rm a}(D)-\\vecχ(D)$, even among tournaments with dichromatic number 2 and bipartite tournaments (where the dichromatic number is always 2). We prove several complexity results, including that deciding whether $\\vecχ_{\\rm a}(D)\\leq 2$ is NP-complete already for bipartite digraphs, while it is polynomial for tournaments (contrary to the case for dichromatic number).

Solar filaments often exhibit rotation and deflection during eruptions, which would significantly affect the geoeffectiveness of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that lead to such lateral displacement of filaments is a great concern to space weather forecasting. Two case studies are discussed. Firstly, the events of September 8 and September 10 2014, were analyzed from the Sun to the Earth. The numerical heliospheric simulation EUHFORIA shows that the handedness of the EUV sigmoid deduced from coronagraph observations was different from the tilt of the ICME at 1~au, suggesting a rotation of the CME in the low corona. A potential undetected low coronal rotation led to erroneous space weather prediction. The second event concerns a filament observed on August 20 2021, which underwent a rotation of 73 degrees during its eruption, implying a significant lateral drifting of the filament material. A data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation confirms such a rotation. These two studies reinforce the idea that CMEs are subjected to more significant rotation and deflection in the low corona than during their journey in the heliosphere."

This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation. Our protocols outperform conventional forward-moving-only methods, providing new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport and preparation, ultimately advancing the capabilities of quantum control and quantum operations."

While reproducible enhancement is crucial in experiments, the fluctuations of the enhancement factor remain largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments, simulations, and exact analytical results using random matrix theory to determine its full distribution in multi-point focusing. Our theoretical framework goes beyond the Marčenko-Pastur law-valid only in the limit of a large number of channels-by accurately predicting the mean enhancement in finite-channel experiments and its fluctuations whenever long-range mesoscopic correlations are negligible (e.g., in weakly scattering media or under limited wavefront control). Notably, in the strongly scattering regime, experiments and simulations reveal giant fluctuations in the enhancement factor, which we attribute directly to long-range mesoscopic correlations. From a fundamental perspective, our results provide a direct method for quantifying long-range correlations in wavefront-shaping-based focusing, even with a limited number of input control channels. On the applied side, they enable the accurate prediction of the enhancement factor and a lower bound on its fluctuations, which are crucial for biomedical imaging, optical metrology, optical trapping, and communication through scattering media."

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency."

    "abstract": "The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings."

We focus on the description of valley splittings in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits, with a particular attention to alloy disorder. We demonstrate that the two bands k.p model reproduces the valley splittings of atomistic tight-binding calculations in relevant heterostructures (SiGe spikes, wiggle wells...), yet at a much lower cost. We show that the model also captures the effects of valley-orbit mixing and yields the correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements that characterize manipulation, dephasing and relaxation in spin/valley qubits. We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant."

    "abstract": "Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods."

The monolithic representation ensures stability and structural integrity, whereas the decoupled form enables efficient distributed simulation via operator splitting or dynamic iteration."

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym will be released."

Here we report in situ x-ray diffraction measurements of Fe, Fe + 4.5 FeO (atomic proportion), and Fe2O3 melts at 177-438 GPa, achieved using laser-driven shock compression at an x-ray free-electron laser. The melts exhibit Fe-O coordination numbers between 4.0(0.4) and 4.5(0.4), indicating predominantly four-fold coordination environments. These coordination states are significantly smaller than those of Fe-bearing lower-mantle phases such as bridgmanite and ferropericlase. Shorter Fe-Fe interatomic distances in compressed iron oxide melts drive the denser packing relative to ambient melts, while the structural differences between Fe + 4.5 FeO and Fe2O3 melts under shock indicate that the oxidation state modulates oxygen solubility in liquid Fe. At around 177 GPa (380 km below the core-mantle boundary), Fe2O3 melts exhibit higher Fe-O coordination, suggesting that local variations in oxygen content could contribute to the stratification in the uppermost outer-core inferred from seismological and geomagnetic observations."

The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to neural network compression that addresses redundancy at both the filter and architectural levels through a unified framework grounded in information flow analysis. Building on the concept of tensor flow divergence, which quantifies how information is transformed across network layers, we develop a two-stage optimization process. The first stage employs iterative divergence-aware pruning to identify and remove redundant filters while preserving critical information pathways. The second stage extends this principle to higher-level architecture optimization by analyzing layer-wise contributions to information propagation and selectively eliminating entire layers that demonstrate minimal impact on network performance. The proposed method naturally adapts to diverse architectures, including convolutional networks, transformers, and hybrid designs, providing a consistent metric for comparing the structural importance across different layer types. Experimental validation across multiple modern architectures and datasets reveals that this combined approach achieves substantial model compression while maintaining competitive accuracy. The presented approach achieves parameter reduction results that are globally comparable to those of state-of-the-art solutions and outperforms them across a wide range of modern neural network architectures, from convolutional models to transformers. The results demonstrate how flow divergence serves as an effective guiding principle for both filter-level and layer-level optimization, offering practical benefits for deployment in resource-constrained environments."

ClimateAgent decomposes user questions into executable sub-tasks coordinated by an Orchestrate-Agent and a Plan-Agent; acquires data via specialized Data-Agents that dynamically introspect APIs to synthesize robust download scripts; and completes analysis and reporting with a Coding-Agent that generates Python code, visualizations, and a final report with a built-in self-correction loop.

On Climate-Agent-Bench-85, ClimateAgent achieves 100% task completion and a report quality score of 8.32, outperforming GitHub-Copilot (6.27) and a GPT-5 baseline (3.26).

These coefficients may fall outside the assumptions of classical theory, particularly when the effective dielectric permittivity and/or magnetic permeability are negative. This situation can transform a coercive operator into a non-coercive one, potentially leading to ill-posedness. In this paper, we utilize the Constraint Energy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM), specifically designed for time-harmonic electromagnetic wave problems, where the construction of auxiliary spaces in the original CEM-GMsFEM is tailored to accommodate the sign-changing setting. Based on the framework of \\texttt{T}-coercivity theory and resolution conditions, we establish the inf-sup stability and provide an a priori error estimate for the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in handling such sophisticated coefficient profiles."

    "abstract": "Repairing RTL bugs is crucial for hardware design and verification. Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems."

Our analysis identifies two key momentum-space features that play a crucial role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal phase. The first is the sixfold anisotropy in the momentum-space exchange interaction, which acts as a locking potential favoring triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystals. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that a larger anisotropy tends to enhance the stability region of the skyrmion crystal in the temperature--magnetic-field phase diagram. The second factor is the momentum-space energy related to the uniform spin mode, which correlates with the emergence of the skyrmion crystal phase at finite temperatures. These results provide a further understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the skyrmion crystal phase in frustrated magnets and will be useful for the design of skyrmion-hosting materials."

Over the last 50 years, most work on pair correlation of zeta-zeros has continued to assume RH. Here we show that if RH could be removed from Montgomery's simple zero proof, then this would also give a proof that 2/3 of the zeros are on the critical line. While at present we cannot unconditionally obtain this result, we have proved in joint work that this is true if we assume all the zeros are in a narrow enough region centered on the critical line. In separate joint work we use the same idea with a related pair correlation method to prove that assuming the Pair Correlation Conjecture, also without the assumption of RH, we obtain 100\\% of the zeros are simple and on the critical line."

It turns out that the model $\\mathfrak{L}(F_{μν};ψ) = L(F_{μν};ψ) + W(ψ)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $ψ$.

The simulations are first benchmarked against classical absorption theory, verifying that the implemented Coulomb collision model accurately reproduces the theoretical IB heating rate. A direct comparison of the electron temperature evolution in the broadband and monochromatic cases shows that, although spectral broadening introduces transient picosecond-scale oscillations in the heating rate driven by stochastic intensity fluctuations, the long-term averaged heating and net IB absorption remain essentially unchanged."

Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking. These findings identify disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two dimensional quantum materials."

    "abstract": "Cross-Disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing (CDCKT) faces a critical challenge: insufficient student interaction data in the target discipline prevents effective knowledge state modeling and performance prediction. Existing cross-disciplinary methods rely on overlapping entities between disciplines for knowledge transfer through simple mapping functions, but suffer from two key limitations: (1) overlapping entities are scarce in real-world scenarios, and (2) simple mappings inadequately capture cross-disciplinary knowledge complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mixed of Experts and Adversarial Generative Network-based Cross-disciplinary Cold-start Knowledge Tracing Framework. Our approach consists of three key components: First, we pre-train a source discipline model and cluster student knowledge states into K categories. Second, these cluster attributes guide a mixture-of-experts network through a gating mechanism, serving as a cross-domain mapping bridge. Third, an adversarial discriminator enforces feature separation by pulling same-attribute student features closer while pushing different-attribute features apart, effectively mitigating small-sample limitations. We validate our method's effectiveness across 20 extreme cross-disciplinary cold-start scenarios."

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception, an emerging paradigm in autonomous driving, has been introduced to mitigate the limitations of single-vehicle systems, such as limited sensor range and occlusion. To improve the robustness of inter-vehicle data sharing, semantic communication has recently further been integrated into collaborative perception systems to enhance overall performance. However, practical deployment of such systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of sensors across different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This diversity in perceptual data complicates the design of a unified communication framework and impedes the effective fusion of shared information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-modal semantic communication (CMSC) framework to facilitate effective collaboration among CAVs with disparate sensor configurations. Specifically, the framework first transforms heterogeneous perceptual features from different sensor modalities into a unified and standardized semantic space. Subsequently, encoding, transmission, and decoding are performed within this semantic space, enabling seamless and effective information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMSC achieves significantly stronger perception performance than existing methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes."

    "abstract": "REWA introduces a general theory of similarity based on witness-overlap structures. We show that whenever similarity between concepts can be expressed as monotone witness overlap -- whether arising from graph neighborhoods, causal relations, temporal structure, topological features, symbolic patterns, or embedding-based neighborhoods -- it admits a reduction to compact encodings with provable ranking preservation guarantees. REWA systems consist of: (1) finite witness sets $W(v)$, (2) semi-random bit assignments generated from each witness, and (3) monotonicity of expected similarity in the overlap $Δ(u, v) = |W(u) \\cap W(v)|$. We prove that under an overlap-gap condition on the final witness sets -- independent of how they were constructed -- top-$k$ rankings are preserved using $m = O(\\log(|V|/δ))$ bits. The witness-set formulation is compositional: any sequence of structural, temporal, causal, topological, information-theoretic, or learned transformations can be combined into pipelines that terminate in discrete witness sets. The theory applies to the final witness overlap, enabling modular construction of similarity systems from reusable primitives. This yields a vast design space: millions of composable similarity definitions inherit logarithmic encoding complexity. REWA subsumes and unifies Bloom filters, minhash, LSH bitmaps, random projections, sketches, and hierarchical filters as special cases. It provides a principled foundation for similarity systems whose behavior is governed by witness overlap rather than hash-function engineering. This manuscript presents the axioms, the main reducibility theorem, complete proofs with explicit constants, and a detailed discussion of compositional design, limitations, and future extensions including multi-bit encodings, weighted witnesses, and non-set representations."

This paper investigates both the exact and asymptotic distributions of the square root of a standard Wishart matrix. We first derive the exact distribution of the square root matrix. Then, by leveraging the Bartlett decomposition, we establish the joint asymptotic normality of the upper-triangular entries of the square root matrix. The resulting limiting distribution resembles that of a scaled Gaussian Wigner ensemble. Additionally, we quantify the rate of convergence using the 1-Wasserstein distance. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate rapid convergence even with relatively low degrees of freedom. These results offer refined insights into the asymptotic behavior of random matrix functionals."

Subsequent studies have achieved further improvements through refining the message passing schemes in GNN models or exploiting various data augmentation techniques to mitigate limited supervision. In real graphs, nodes often tend to form tightly-knit communities/clusters, which embody abundant signals for compensating label scarcity in semi-supervised node classification but are not explored in prior methods. Inspired by this, this paper presents NCGC that integrates self-supervised graph clustering and semi-supervised classification into a unified framework. Firstly, we theoretically unify the optimization objectives of GNNs and spectral graph clustering, and based on that, develop soft orthogonal GNNs (SOGNs) that leverage a refined message passing paradigm to generate node representations for both classification and clustering. On top of that, NCGC includes a self-supervised graph clustering module that enables the training of SOGNs for learning representations of unlabeled nodes in a self-supervised manner. Particularly, this component comprises two non-trivial clustering objectives and a Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization that transforms predicted cluster assignments into balanced soft pseudo-labels. Through combining the foregoing clustering module with the classification model using a multi-task objective containing the supervised classification loss on labeled data and self-supervised clustering loss on unlabeled data, NCGC promotes synergy between them and achieves enhanced model capacity. Our extensive experiments showcase that the proposed NCGC framework consistently and considerably outperforms popular GNN models and recent baselines for semi-supervised node classification on seven real graphs, when working with various classic GNN backbones."

However, such a design encounters significant challenges, such as the risk of outdated updates from straggler clients degrading the overall model performance and the potential bias introduced by faster clients dominating the learning process, especially under heterogeneous data distributions. Existing methods typically address only one of these issues, creating a conflict where mitigating the impact of outdated updates can exacerbate the bias created by faster clients, and vice versa. To address these challenges, we propose FedEcho, a novel framework that incorporates uncertainty-aware distillation to enhance the asynchronous FL performances under large asynchronous delays and data heterogeneity. Specifically, uncertainty-aware distillation enables the server to assess the reliability of predictions made by straggler clients, dynamically adjusting the influence of these predictions based on their estimated uncertainty. By prioritizing more certain predictions while still leveraging the diverse information from all clients, FedEcho effectively mitigates the negative impacts of outdated updates and data heterogeneity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedEcho consistently outperforms existing asynchronous federated learning baselines, achieving robust performance without requiring access to private client data."

Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device.

    "abstract": "The 3D bin packing problem, with its diverse industrial applications, has garnered significant research attention in recent years. Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves lower collapse rates in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Large-scale deployments in logistics systems validate the practical effectiveness, with a 35\\% reduction in packing collapse compared to baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) has been proposed to enrich user-item interactions by incorporating information from various domains. Despite current progress, the imbalance issue and transition issue hinder further development of CDSR. The former one presents a phenomenon that the interactions in one domain dominate the entire behavior, leading to difficulty in capturing the domain-specific features in the other domain. The latter points to the difficulty in capturing users' cross-domain preferences within the mixed interaction sequence, resulting in poor next-item prediction performance for specific domains. With world knowledge and powerful reasoning ability, Large Language Models (LLMs) partially alleviate the above issues by performing as a generator and an encoder. However, current LLMs-enhanced CDSR methods are still under exploration, which fail to recognize the irrelevant noise and rough profiling problems. Thus, to make peace with the aforementioned challenges, we proposed an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation with Dual-phase Training ({LLM-EDT}). To address the imbalance issue while introducing less irrelevant noise, we first propose the transferable item augmenter to adaptively generate possible cross-domain behaviors for users. Then, to alleviate the transition issue, we introduce a dual-phase training strategy to empower the domain-specific thread with a domain-shared background. As for the rough profiling problem, we devise a domain-aware profiling module to summarize the user's preference in each domain and adaptively aggregate them to generate comprehensive user profiles. The experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-EDT.

Contemporary imaging genetic studies integrate genetic and neuroimaging data to investigate how genetic variation contributes to brain disorders via intermediate neuroimaging endophenotypes. However, the large number of potential exposures (genes) and mediators (neuroimaging features) pose new challenges to the traditional mediation analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-exposure-to-multi-mediator mediation model that integrates genetic, neuroimaging and phenotypic data to investigate the \"geneneuroimaging-brain disorder\" mediation pathway. Our method jointly reduces the dimensions of exposures and mediators into low-dimensional aggregators where the mediation effect is maximized. We further introduce sparsity into the loadings to improve the interpretability. To target the bi-convex optimization problem, we implement an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm with block coordinate updates. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm and establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods in recovering true loadings and true mediation proportions across a wide range of signal strengths, noise levels, and correlation structures. We further illustrate the utility of the method through a mediation analysis that integrates genetic, brain functional connectivity and smoking behavior data from UK Biobank, and identifies critical genes that impact nicotine dependence via changing the functional connectivity in specific brain regions."

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

Following injury, various mechanical modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature that seek to quantify neuronal-scale to tissue-scale metrics of brain damage. Broadly, the two categories of degradation encompass physiological deterioration of neurons and upregulation of chemical entities such as neurotransmitters which causes initiation of downstream pathophysiological effects. Despite the many contributing pathways, in this work, we delineate and model a potential glia-initiated injury pathway that leads to secondary injury. The goal of this work is to demonstrate a continuum framework which models the multiphysics of mechano-chemical interactions underlying TBI. Using a coupled PDE (partial differential equation) formulation and FEM (finite element method) discretization, the framework highlights evolution of field variables which spatio-temporally resolve mechanical metrics and chemical species across neuronal clusters. The modeling domain encompasses microglia, neurons and the extracellular matrix. The continuum framework used to model the mechano-chemical interactions assumes a three dimensional viscoelastic network to capture the mechanical response underlying proteins constituting the neuron microstructure and advection-diffusion equations modeling spatio-temporal evolution of chemical species. We use this framework to numerically estimate key concentrations of chemical species produced by the strain field. In this work, we identify key biomarkers within the labyrinth of molecular pathways and build a framework that captures the core mechano-chemical interactions. This framework is an attempt to quantify secondary injury and thus assist in developing targeted TBI treatments."

Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \\times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \\times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality."

While pre-trained transformer backbones have shown broad generalization capabilities in biological sequence modeling, their application to multi-omics integration remains underexplored. We present MoRE (Multi-Omics Representation Embedding), a framework that repurposes frozen pre-trained transformers to align heterogeneous assays into a shared latent space. Unlike purely generative approaches, MoRE employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy, prioritizing cross-sample and cross-modality alignment over simple sequence reconstruction. Specifically, MoRE attaches lightweight, modality-specific adapters and a task-adaptive fusion layer to the frozen backbone. It optimizes a masked modeling objective jointly with supervised contrastive and batch-invariant alignment losses, yielding structure-preserving embeddings that generalize across unseen cell types and platforms. We benchmark MoRE against established baselines, including scGPT, scVI, and Harmony with scArches, evaluating integration fidelity, rare population detection, and modality transfer. Our results demonstrate that MoRE achieves competitive batch robustness and biological conservation while significantly reducing trainable parameters compared to fully fine-tuned models. This work positions MoRE as a practical step toward general-purpose omics foundation models."

The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the boost parameter and the width of the Gaussian wave packets. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with increase in the width of the Gaussian wave packet, higher values of boost parameter, and the number of particles on which boost is applied."

This bijection considers the set of vertices with value 2 under the functions. In this paper, we will generalize this idea by defining so called nice Roman Domination properties for which we can employ this method. With this idea, we can show that all minimal maximal Roman Dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay in O(1.9332^n) time. Furthermore, we prove that enumerating all minimal connected/total Roman dominating functions on cobipartite graphs can be achieved with polynomial delay.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing topologically consistent facial geometry is crucial for the digital avatar creation pipelines. Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data. Code is available at https://github.com/grignarder/vggtface."

    "abstract": "Lung airways are lined by a film of mucus which protects the epithelium from inhaled particles. To maintain a uniform coating, the mucus that is secreted into airways must be distributed into a film by wall-attached cilia, which constantly convey mucus along the airway. However, the film's natural tendency is to accumulate into humps and plugs, due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. To understand the behaviour of the film amidst these competing factors, we perform simulations of an idealized tubular airway using a reduced-order thin-film model. The axial boundaries are nonperiodic, allowing for cilia-driven inflow and outflow; a tangential velocity along the tubular wall models ciliary transport, while a localized source at the wall accounts for secretion. On increasing the mucus input rate, we find three distinct film morphologies: (i) uniform flat films; (ii) nonuniform films that are composed of travelling unduloid-shaped humps, separated by mucus-depleted zones; and (iii) films that form an occluding plug. The flat-film regime, absent in closed periodic domains, emerges as a consequence of the convective nature of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the presence of ciliary transport. Higher secretion rates increase the mean film-thickness and induce a convective-to-absolute transition, which manifests in the appearance of travelling humps. In the plug-forming regime, capillary forces dominate and drive the incoming mucus into a single hump, which resists ciliary translation and remains near the mucus source. Our results show how low-level baseline secretion sustains a protective, uniform mucus film, and how hypersecretion -- stimulated, for example, by inhaled allergens -- produces mucus plugs."

    "abstract": "Online advertising aims to increase user engagement and maximize revenue, but users respond heterogeneously to ad exposure. Some users purchase only when exposed to ads, while others purchase regardless of exposure, and still others never purchase. This heterogeneity can be characterized by latent response types, commonly referred to as principal strata, defined by users' joint potential outcomes under exposure and non-exposure. However, users' true strata are unobserved, making direct analysis infeasible. In this article, instead of learning the true strata, we propose a novel approach that learns users' pseudo-strata by leveraging information from an outcome (revenue) observed after the response (purchase). We construct pseudo-strata to classify users and introduce misclassification rewards to quantify the expected revenue gain of pseudo-strata-based policies relative to true strata. Within a Bayesian classification framework, we learn the pseudo-strata by optimizing the expected revenue. To implement these procedures, we introduce identification assumptions and estimation methods, and establish their large-sample properties. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves more accurate strata classification and substantially higher revenue than baselines. We further illustrate the method using a large-scale industrial dataset from the Criteo Predictive Search Platform."

Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions δn = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the Θ is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |Θ| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems."

    "abstract": "Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference."

    "abstract": "The wetting behavior of drops on natural and industrial surfaces is determined by the advancing and receding contact angles. They are commonly measured by the sessile drop technique, also called goniometry, which doses liquid through a solid needle. Consequently, this method requires substantial drop volumes, long contact times, tends to be user-dependent, and is difficult to automate. Here, we propose the stood-up drop (SUD) technique as an alternative to measure receding contact angles. The method consists of depositing a liquid drop on a surface by a short liquid jet, at which it spreads radially forming a pancake-shaped film. Then the liquid retracts, forming a spherical cap drop shape (stood-up drop). At this quasi-equilibrium state, the contact angle ($θ_\\text{SUD}$) closely resembles the receding contact angle measured by goniometry. Our method is suitable for a wide variety of surfaces from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, overcoming typical complications of goniometry such as needle-induced distortion of the drop shape, and it reduces user dependence. We delineate when the receding contact angle can be obtained by the stood-up method using Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) simulations that systematically vary viscosity, contact angle, and deposited drop volume. Finally, we provide simple scaling criteria to predict when the stood-up drop technique works."

However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting."

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $μ$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there are experimental reports on exotic-hadron candidates, which have different quark configurations from ordinary $q\\bar q$ and $qqq$ constituents. However, it is not easy to confirm their exotic nature from global observables such as masses, spins, parities, and decay widths. At high energies, internal quark and gluon configurations could become more apparent because hadrons should be described by fundamental degrees of freedom of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics. One of such possibilities is to use the fragmentation functions (FFs). In this work, accurate FFs of an exotic hadron candidate $f_0$(980) are determined for the first time by an global analysis of experimental data on $e^+ + e^- \\to f_0 (980)+X$ with recent precise measurements of the Belle collaboration. From the global analysis, we found that their second moments have a relation $M_u = M_d \\ll M_s \\sim M_g $ for up-quark, down-quark, strange-quark, and gluon FFs. Furthermore, the function $D_s^{f_0}(z)$ is distributed in the larger-$z$ region in comparison with the functions $D_{u}^{f_0}(z)$, $D_{d}^{f_0}(z)$, and $D_g^{f_0}(z)$. These facts support that the $f_0 (980)$ has the $s\\bar s$ configuration at high energies. This is a new finding that $f_0 (980)$ should be considered mainly as the $s\\bar s$ state, which is different from our usual understanding as a tetraquark (or $K\\bar K$) hadron from low-energy studies. Our results could indicate the transition of the internal configuration picture that $f_0 (980)$ looks like a $q\\bar q$ state at high energies although it is described by tetra-quark or $K\\bar K$ molecule state at low energies. It sheds light on a new direction in exotic hadron physics."

Both quantities are consistent with those of neighboring Cd and Sn nuclei, but show substantial discrepancies with currently available model predictions. In contrast to earlier observations in the neighboring isotopic chains, $^{109}$In does not exhibit any significant enhancement of the dipole strength near the neutron separation energy.

To address this, we propose the Sculpted Memory Forgetting Adapter (SMFA), which confines forgetting to targeted memory regions while preserving overall capabilities. SMFA first fine-tunes the model to replace sensitive responses with refusals, yielding a memory forgetting adapter, and then applies a retaining anchor-guided masking mechanism to prevent interference with unrelated knowledge and understanding ability. To systematically evaluate selective MLLM unlearning, we introduce S-MLLMUn Bench, the first benchmark designed to jointly assess the removal of sensitive knowledge and retention of general visual understanding. Extensive experiments show that, unlike prior methods, SMFA achieves precise and controllable unlearning while maintaining the model's foundational image understanding."

Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning. In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them. We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures."

    "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation System~(SRS) has become pivotal in modern society, which predicts subsequent actions based on the user's historical behavior. However, traditional collaborative filtering-based sequential recommendation models often lead to suboptimal performance due to the limited information of their collaborative signals. With the rapid development of LLMs, an increasing number of works have incorporated LLMs' world knowledge into sequential recommendation. Although they achieve considerable gains, these approaches typically assume the correctness of LLM-generated results and remain susceptible to noise induced by LLM hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRASP (Generation Augmented Retrieval with Holistic Attention for Sequential Prediction), a flexible framework that integrates generation augmented retrieval for descriptive synthesis and similarity retrieval, and holistic attention enhancement which employs multi-level attention to effectively employ LLM's world knowledge even with hallucinations and better capture users' dynamic interests. The retrieved similar users/items serve as auxiliary contextual information for the later holistic attention enhancement module, effectively mitigating the noisy guidance of supervision-based methods. Comprehensive evaluations on two public benchmarks and one industrial dataset reveal that GRASP consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when integrated with diverse backbones.

    "abstract": "We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation."

Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads."

Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for scientific applications, yet open-source models still struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA), namely answering questions about figures from scientific papers. A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community."

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

    "abstract": "As deep image forgery powered by AI generative models, such as GANs, continues to challenge today's digital world, detecting AI-generated forgeries has become a vital security topic. Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics."

    "abstract": "This work addresses electric vehicle (EV) charging station placement through a bi-level optimization model, where the upper-level planner maximizes net revenue by selecting station locations under budget constraints, while EV users at the lower level choose routes and charging stations to minimize travel and charging costs. To account for range anxiety, we construct a battery-expanded network and apply a shortest path algorithm with Frank-Wolfe traffic assignment. Our primary contribution is developing the first exact solution algorithm for large scale EV charging station placement problems. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithm enhanced with value function cuts and column generation. While existing research relies on heuristic methods that provide no optimality guarantees or exact algorithms that require prohibitively long runtimes, our exact algorithm delivers globally optimal solutions with mathematical certainty under a reasonable runtime. Computational experiments on the Eastern Massachusetts network (74 nodes, 248 links), the Anaheim network (416 nodes, 914 links), and the Barcelona network (110 zones, 1,020 nodes, and 2,512 links) demonstrate exceptional performance. Our algorithm terminates within minutes rather than hours, while achieving optimality gaps below 1% across all instances. This result represents a computational speedup of over two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. The algorithm successfully handles problems with over 300,000 feasible combinations, which transform EV charging infrastructure planning from a computationally prohibitive problem into a tractable optimization task suitable for practical decision making problem for real world networks."

An adaptive semantic communication strategy dynamically adjusts coding schemes and transmission power according to task urgency and channel quality. A semantic-driven collaboration mechanism further supports task decomposition and conflict-free coordination among heterogeneous devices.

Beyond specific precautionary measures, there have been a range of other advances in techniques for making AI models and systems more reliable and resistant to misuse. These include new approaches in adversarial training, data curation, and monitoring systems. In parallel, institutional frameworks that operationalise and formalise these technical capabilities are starting to emerge: the number of companies publishing Frontier AI Safety Frameworks more than doubled in 2025, and governments and international organisations have established a small number of governance frameworks for general-purpose AI, focusing largely on transparency and risk assessment."

However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into \"pseudo-images\" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a \"warmup-align\" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two effective distributed learning paradigms in wireless networks, enabling collaborative model training across mobile devices without sharing raw data. While FL supports low-latency parallel training, it may converge to less accurate model. In contrast, SL achieves higher accuracy through sequential training but suffers from increased delay. To leverage the advantages of both, hybrid split and federated learning (HSFL) allows some devices to operate in FL mode and others in SL mode. This paper aims to accelerate HSFL by addressing three key questions: 1) How does learning mode selection affect overall learning performance? 2) How does it interact with batch size? 3) How can these hyperparameters be jointly optimized alongside communication and computational resources to reduce overall learning delay? We first analyze convergence, revealing the interplay between learning mode and batch size. Next, we formulate a delay minimization problem and propose a two-stage solution: a block coordinate descent method for a relaxed problem to obtain a locally optimal solution, followed by a rounding algorithm to recover integer batch sizes with near-optimal performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly accelerates convergence to the target accuracy compared to existing methods."

We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications."

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights."

    "abstract": "Multi-modal analytical processing has the potential to transform applications in e-commerce, healthcare, entertainment, and beyond. However, real-world adoption remains elusive due to the limited ability of traditional relational query operators to capture query semantics. The emergence of foundation models, particularly the large language models (LLMs), opens up new opportunities to develop flexible, semantic-aware data analytics systems that transcend the relational paradigm. We present Nirvana, a multi-modal data analytics framework that incorporates programmable semantic operators while leveraging both logical and physical query optimization strategies, tailored for LLM-driven semantic query processing. Nirvana addresses two key challenges. First, it features an agentic logical optimizer that uses natural language-specified transformation rules and random-walk-based search to explore vast spaces of semantically equivalent query plans -- far beyond the capabilities of conventional optimizers. Second, it introduces a cost-aware physical optimizer that selects the most effective LLM backend for each operator using a novel improvement-score metric. To further enhance efficiency, Nirvana incorporates computation reuse and evaluation pushdown techniques guided by model capability hypotheses. Experimental evaluations on three real-world benchmarks demonstrate that Nirvana is able to reduce end-to-end runtime by 10%--85% and reduces system processing costs by 76% on average, outperforming state-of-the-art systems at both efficiency and scalability."

More fundamentally, prompt quality itself lacks a unified, systematic definition, resulting in fragmented and unreliable evaluation signals. Our approach first establishes a performance-oriented, systematic, and comprehensive prompt evaluation framework. Furthermore, we develop and finetune an execution-free evaluator that predicts multi-dimensional quality scores directly from text. The evaluator then instructs a metric-aware optimizer that diagnoses failure modes and rewrites prompts in an interpretable, query-dependent manner. Our evaluator achieves the strongest accuracy in predicting prompt performance, and the evaluation-instructed optimization consistently surpass both static-template and query-dependent baselines across eight datasets and on three backbone models. Overall, we propose a unified, metric-grounded perspective on prompt quality, and demonstrated that our evaluation-instructed optimization pipeline delivers stable, interpretable, and model-agnostic improvements across diverse tasks."

    "abstract": "Originating in evolutionary game theory, the class of \"zero-determinant\" strategies enables a player to unilaterally enforce linear payoff relationships in simple repeated games. An upshot of this kind of payoff constraint is that it can shape the incentives for the opponent in a predetermined way. An example is when a player ensures that the agents get equal payoffs. While extensively studied in infinite-horizon games, extensions to discounted games, nonlinear payoff relationships, richer strategic environments, and behaviors with long memory remain incompletely understood. In this paper, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a player to enforce arbitrary payoff relationships (linear or nonlinear), in expectation, in discounted games. These conditions characterize precisely which payoff relationships are enforceable using strategies of arbitrary complexity. Our main result establishes that any such enforceable relationship can actually be implemented using a simple two-point reactive learning strategy, which conditions on the opponent's most recent action and the player's own previous mixed action, using information from only one round into the past. For additive payoff constraints, we show that enforcement is possible using even simpler (reactive) strategies that depend solely on the opponent's last move. In other words, this tractable class is universal within expectation-enforcing strategies. As examples, we apply these results to characterize extortionate, generous, equalizer, and fair strategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma, asymmetric donation game, nonlinear donation game, and the hawk-dove game, identifying precisely when each class of strategy is enforceable and with what minimum discount factor."

While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected."

We study the creeping dynamics of a densely monitored landslide in Western Norway to decipher the role of fluid flow in destabilizing this landslide. In Åknes, approximately 50 million cubic meter of rock mass continuously creeps over a shear zone made of rock fragments, with seasonal accelerations that strongly correlate with rainfall. In this natural laboratory for fluid-induced frictional creep, unprecedented monitoring equipment reveals low fluid pressure across the shear zone, thereby challenging the dominant theory of fluid-driven instability in landslides. Here, we show that a generic micromechanical model can disentangle the effects of fluid flow from those of fluid pressure, and demonstrate that seepage forces applied by channelized flow along the shear zone are the main driver of creep accelerations. We conclude by discussing the significance of seepage forces, the implications for hazard mitigation and the broader applicability of our model to various geological contexts governed by friction across saturated shear zones."

    "abstract": "Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance."

This paper introduces a novel framework that conceptualizes noisy label correction as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. The proposed approach, Reinforcement Learning for Noisy Label Correction (RLNLC), defines a comprehensive state space representing data and their associated labels, an action space that indicates possible label corrections, and a reward mechanism that evaluates the efficacy of label corrections. RLNLC learns a deep feature representation based policy network to perform label correction through reinforcement learning, utilizing an actor-critic method. The learned policy is subsequently deployed to iteratively correct noisy training labels and facilitate the training of the prediction model. The effectiveness of RLNLC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques for learning with noisy labels."

However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space. It achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching the best latent diffusion models."

However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks."

To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

However, re-running the same inference process twice often leads to different results due to benign numerical noise, making it difficult to distinguish legitimate variation from actual problems. To address this problem, we introduce Token-DiFR (Token-Divergence-From-Reference), a method for verifying inference outputs by comparing generated tokens against predictions made by a trusted reference implementation conditioned on the same random seed. Sampling seed synchronization tightly constrains valid outputs, leaving providers minimal room to deviate from correct inference, which allows output tokens themselves to serve as auditable evidence of correctness at zero additional cost to the provider. Token-DiFR reliably identifies sampling errors, simulated bugs, and model quantization, detecting 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 within 300 output tokens. For applications requiring sample-efficient forward-pass verification, we additionally introduce Activation-DiFR, a scheme that uses random orthogonal projections to compress activations into compact fingerprints for subsequent verification. Activation-DiFR detects 4-bit quantization with AUC $>$ 0.999 using just 2 output tokens, while reducing communication overhead by 25-75% relative to existing methods.

In contrast, LLM-based techniques are prohibitively expensive due to their reliance on frontier models (without which they cannot reliably generate compilable translations), thus limiting scalability. This paper proposes Rustine, a fully automated pipeline for effective and efficient repository-level C to idiomatic safe Rust translation. Evaluating on a diverse set of 23 C programs, ranging from 27 to 13,200 lines of code, Rustine can generate fully compilable Rust code for all and achieve 87% functional equivalence (passing 1,063,099 assertions out of 1,221,192 in test suites with average function and line coverage of 74.7% and 72.2%). Compared to six prior repository-level C to Rust translation techniques, the translations by Rustine are overall safer (fewer raw pointers, pointer arithmetic, and unsafe constructs), more idiomatic (fewer Rust linter violations), and more readable. When the translations cannot pass all tests to fulfill functional equivalence, human developers were able to complete the task in 4.5 hours, on average, using Rustine as debugging support."

Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities."

We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

    "abstract": "Foundation models are transformative in artificial intelligence, but building them from scratch, especially for mobility trajectories, is not yet clear or documented. This tutorial bridges this gap by demonstrating the steps and code of a minimal implementation of a trajectory-focused foundation model starting from GPT-2. Through a concise, step-by-step, code-driven process, we demonstrate adapting GPT-2 for spatiotemporal data. We then review and compare representative trajectory foundation models, such as TrajFM and TrajGPT, highlighting their architectural innovations and differences. Additionally, we introduce complementary techniques from related domains, like TimesFM's patching approach. Targeted at researchers and practitioners, this tutorial aims to explain the concepts and terminology of foundation models, at the implementation level. We find it timely and indispensable to create this educational material in order to support the SIGSPATIAL community in building and evaluating mobility foundation models, enhancing both research clarity and peer-review effectiveness in mobility AI."

    "abstract": "Alignment with human preferences is an important evaluation aspect of LLMs, requiring them to be helpful, honest, safe, and to precisely follow human instructions. Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs."

    "abstract": "The learning process of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent remains poorly understood beyond the mathematical formulation of its learning algorithm. To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning."

    "abstract": "Microgrids are deployed to reduce purchased grid energy, limit exposure to volatile tariffs, and ensure service continuity during disturbances. This requires coordinating heterogeneous distributed energy resources across multiple time scales and under variable conditions. Among existing tools, typically, power-system simulators capture physical behaviour but assume centralized control, while multi-agent frameworks model decentralized decision-making but represent energy with no physical grounding. In this context, the EnergyTwin is introduced, an agent-based microgrid simulation environment that couples physically grounded models with forecast-informed, rolling-horizon planning, and negotiations. Each asset is modeled as an agent, interacting with a central agent that obtains forecasts, formulates predictions, and allocates energy through contract-based interactions. EnergyTwin targets tertiary-layer decision making and is extensible for digital-twin use. Its feasibility was evaluated in a university campus microgrid scenario where multiple planning strategies were compared. Achieved results show that forecast-driven rolling-horizon planning increases local energy self-sufficiency, maintains higher battery reserves, and reduces exposure to low-resilience operating states. They demonstrate also potential of EnergyTwin as platform supporting research on resilient, negotiation-driven microgrids."

    "abstract": "Trustworthiness has become a key requirement for the deployment of artificial intelligence systems in safety-critical applications. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture uncertainty or the reliability of model predictions, particularly under adversarial or degraded conditions. This paper introduces the \\emph{Parallel Trust Assessment System (PaTAS)}, a framework for modeling and propagating trust in neural networks using Subjective Logic (SL). PaTAS operates in parallel with standard neural computation through \\emph{Trust Nodes} and \\emph{Trust Functions} that propagate input, parameter, and activation trust across the network. The framework defines a \\emph{Parameter Trust Update} mechanism to refine parameter reliability during training and an \\emph{Inference-Path Trust Assessment (IPTA)} method to compute instance-specific trust at inference. Experiments on real-world and adversarial datasets demonstrate that PaTAS produces interpretable, symmetric, and convergent trust estimates that complement accuracy and expose reliability gaps in poisoned, biased, or uncertain data scenarios. The results show that PaTAS effectively distinguishes between benign and adversarial inputs and identifies cases where model confidence diverges from actual reliability. By enabling transparent and quantifiable trust reasoning within neural architectures, PaTAS provides a principled foundation for evaluating model reliability across the AI lifecycle."

The key insight is that solving these optimisation problems requires the ability to simulate from truncated distributions, namely multivariate exponentials and Gaussians. Efficient simulation can be achieved using the algorithms of Kent and Davis. We demonstrate our methodology on portfolio optimisation and the classical farmer problem from stochastic programming. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in visual generation have highlighted the rise of Latent Generative Models (LGMs), which rely on effective visual tokenizers to bridge pixels and semantics. However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan). These results demonstrate that adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, enabling next-generation visual generative models.

The planet-to-star contrast ratio at small angular separations from the host star is often limited by non-common-path aberrations (NCPAs) seen only in the science plane. The photonic lantern (PL) can be used to sense aberrations at the final science imaging plane. This enables a two-stage wavefront control architecture, in which the first-stage wavefront sensor senses atmospheric turbulence and the PL senses NCPAs and other aberrations not seen by the first stage. We demonstrate closed-loop control of residual wavefront errors using a non-dispersed PL after first-stage AO correction on the Shane 3m telescope at Lick Observatory. Our results show that non-dispersed PLs can be used for second-stage wavefront sensing, enabling performance improvements via minimally invasive retrofits to existing AO systems."

Of special interest are photonic circuits employing microwave capacitors, which instantaneously modulate photonic waveguides with frequency $ω_p \\ll ω_0$. While the amplification of light is negligible in such circuits, ideally, frequency conversion can be completed with the conservation of the light amplitude. Therefore, similar to the elastically transparent photonic structures (i.e., structures conserving both the light amplitude and frequency), we can say that a photonic circuit parametrically modulated in time exhibits complete inelastic transparency if a wave enters the structure with frequency $ω_0$ and exits it with a different frequency and the same amplitude. Here, we develop an approach that allows us to introduce and investigate a broad class of time-modulated photonic circuits exhibiting complete inelastic transparency. Light enters these circuits with a resonant frequency $ω_0$, cascades between their $N$ eigenstates separated by the modulation frequency $ω_p$, and exits with frequency $ω_0 + (N-1)ω_p$ and the output amplitude close to the input amplitude. As examples, we consider circuits of ring microresonators and SNAP microresonators."

The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1. Experimental results indicate that these state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating the potential for future research."

Unlike prior mistake understanding work, which lacks fine-grained output, MATT concretely attributes mistakes to the input instruction text or the attempt video. MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision. Experiments on our new datasets and prior benchmarks show that MisFormer outperforms strong video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection baselines."

A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magnetic control of the NHSE along line boundaries in two-dimensional single-band lattices. Using a non-Hermitian extension of the anisotropic Harper--Hofstadter model as a representative example, we show that magnetic fields suppress the geometric skin effect in reciprocal models, whereas skin localization can persist in nonreciprocal systems. The analysis disentangles the interplay of flux, nonreciprocity, and boundary geometry, revealing that magnetic fields mitigate or suppress the NHSE through distinct physical mechanisms -- such as bulk localization via Landau or Anderson physics, or the restoration of effective reciprocity. In particular, the geometry-dependent skin effect in reciprocal systems is found to be fragile against even weak magnetic fields."

Here, we demonstrate such an approach using symbolic regression (SR) with equation learner networks and a reinforcement learning search engine to derive interpretable equations for interatomic interactions. Training data were generated through nested ensemble sampling with density functional theory (DFT) energetics, spanning crystalline to highly disordered states. The optimization of the learner network employed continuous-action Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with gradient descent, enabling efficient exploration of function space. For copper as a representative transition metal, an unconstrained search produced models that outperformed fixed-form Sutton-Chen EAM potentials. The SR-derived models (SR1 and SR2) reproduced key material properties - lattice constants, cohesive energies, equations of state, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, defect formation energies, surface/bulk energetics, and phase transformation with significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, stringent melting simulations using two-phase solid-amorphous interfaces confirmed that SR models accurately capture the interplay of vibrational entropy, cohesive energy, and structural dynamics, surpassing SC-EAM in both qualitative and quantitative predictions. This highlights the potential of SR to deliver fast, accurate, flexible, and physically meaningful potentials, advancing predictive modeling across scales."

MSCIKDF defines a new architectural foundation where identity is derived deterministically but with cryptographically enforced separation across diverse contexts (e.g., blockchain, E2EE, KMS, IoT). It achieves strong security invariants -- such as zero-linkability, multi-curve independence, and resistance to cross-context correlation -- while offering stateless secret rotation that preserves long-term identity continuity without requiring asset migration.

Using public JWST NIRSpec data, we have identified 45 N-emitters with robust NIII] or NIV] detections, including 4 previously known objects. We find N-emitters from redshift $z\\sim 3-11$ among a broad diversity of galaxies, in terms of morphology, UV magnitude, stellar mass, SFR, metallicity, and rest-optical line strengths. The UV nitrogen lines show typical equivalent widths between $\\sim 5-50$ Å. Carbon lines are generally fainter than the N lines. Using strong line calibrations established at high-redshift, we find metallicities $12+log(O/H)\\sim 7.15-8.5$, including thus also high metallicities. The H$β$ equivalent width of N-emitters varies strongly, and sources with low EWs show clear signs of a Balmer break, indicative of composite stellar populations combining both young (< 10 Myr) stars responsible of the UV emission lines and an older population contributing to the rest-optical spectrum. Supersolar N/O ratios are found in all N-emitters. C/O abundances are comparable to those of galaxies at the same metallicity, and all N-emitters show high N/C ratios or lower limits ($\\log(N/C) > 0.5$), independently of metallicity. The observed abundance ratios are compatible with ejecta from H-burning and do not show signs of Carbon enhancements, even at higher metallicities. Finally, we find that the fraction of N-emitters increases with redshift, and we quantify this evolution.

Here we test these new approaches on various one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin systems with a single ejected fermion, i.e., extracting the single-hole spectral function $A(k,ω)$. We compute the Green's function $G(r,τ)$ via a canonical transformation of the fermionic Hamiltonian, implementing it for stochastic series expansion QMC simulations. Our calculations of $A(k,ω)$ focus on the different characteristics of systems with spin-charge separation and those in which a spin polaron forms instead due to effectively attractive interactions between the spin and the charge. Spin-charge separation is well established in the conventional $t$-$J$ chain, which we confirm here as a demonstration of the method. Turning on a multi-spin interaction $Q$ that eventually drives the system into a spontaneously dimerized (valence-bond solid, VBS) state, we can observe the features of spin-charge separation until the VBS transition takes place. While generally good agreement is found with the conventional analytical spin-charge separation ansatz, we point out the formation of a gap between two holon bands that in the ansatz are degenerate at $k=0$ and $k=π$. Inside the VBS phase, effectively attractive interactions may lead to the binding of the spinon and holon, of which we find evidence at large $Q/J$. In the statically dimerized $t$-$J$ chain, we find equally spaced spin polaron bands corresponding to increasingly large bound states with two internal spin polaron modes -- even and odd with respect to parton permutation. Our results overall demonstrate the power of modern analytic continuation tools in combination with large-scale QMC simulations."

    "abstract": "The way humans interact with each other, including interpersonal distances, spatial configuration, and motion, varies significantly across different situations. To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals. Experimental results show that our method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions, outperforming previous approaches that focus only on single-human HOIs. Furthermore, we introduce multi-human motion generation involving objects as an application of our framework."

    "abstract": "Stellarators are a prospective class of fusion-based power plants that confine a hot plasma with three-dimensional magnetic fields. Typically framed as a PDE-constrained optimization problem, stellarator design is a time-consuming process that can take hours to solve on a computing cluster. Developing fast methods for designing stellarators is crucial for advancing fusion research. Given the recent development of large datasets of optimized stellarators, machine learning approaches have emerged as a potential candidate. Motivated by this, we present an open inverse problem to the machine learning community: to rapidly generate high-quality stellarator designs which have a set of desirable characteristics. As a case study in the problem space, we train a conditional diffusion model on data from the QUASR database to generate quasisymmetric stellarator designs with desirable characteristics (aspect ratio and mean rotational transform). The diffusion model is applied to design stellarators with characteristics not seen during training. We provide evaluation protocols and show that many of the generated stellarators exhibit solid performance: less than 5% deviation from quasisymmetry and the target characteristics. The modest deviation from quasisymmetry highlights an opportunity to reach the sub 1% target. Beyond the case study, we share multiple promising avenues for generative modeling to advance stellarator design."

    "abstract": "Continuous piecewise affine (CPA) Lyapunov function synthesis is one method to perform Lyapunov stability analysis for nonlinear systems. This method first generates a mesh over the region of interest in the system's state space and then solves a linear program (LP), which enforces constraints on each vertex of the mesh, to synthesize a Lyapunov function. Finer meshes broaden the class of Lyapunov function candidates, but CPA function synthesis is more computationally expensive for finer meshes -- particularly so in higher dimensional systems. This paper explores methods to mesh the region of interest more efficiently so that a Lyapunov function can be synthesized using less computational effort. Three methods are explored -- adaptive meshing, meshing using knowledge of the system model, and a combination of the two. Numerical examples for two and three dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems are used to compare the efficacy of the three methods."

For the first case, we consider a group action on the phase space together with a set of first-class constraints that can be interpreted as a momentum map. We furnish an explicit example in the case of rotational invariant deformed algebras. In the second case, we consider a single constraint provided by the Hamiltonian, which is a common instance in General Relativity, with straightforward application in cosmology."

Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP."

    "abstract": "Intermittent jet activity of AGNs is a common phenomenon, whereas significant jet reorientation during episodic jet activity in relatively young radio galaxies are rarely reported. The quasar 0954+556 at redshift of 0.903 is an intriguing source exhibiting an unusual radio jet structure with significantly different jet directions at kpc and pc scales. At kpc scales, images from the VLA exhibit a bright core, a linear jet extending 24 kpc to the northwest, and a discrete jet component 16 kpc to the northeast. At pc scales, images from the VLBA show a two-component structure with a projected separation of 360 pc in the north-south direction. The peculiar structure of 0954+556 might result from jet reorientation. Here, our aim was to investigate the possible mechanism via multiscale and multifrequency deep radio images. We performed VLA and VLBA observations of 0954+556. Together with some existing data in the NRAO data archive, we made multiple VLA images at 1.4-22 GHz and VLBA images at 1.7-43 GHz for various image analyses of the jet structure. We identified the location of the radio core at pc scales, detected the faint counter-jets at both pc and kpc scales for the first time, and revealed a diffuse emission region connecting pc and kpc scale forward jets. Our spectral index distribution and spectral aging analysis indicate that 0954+556 might undergo at least two episodes of jet activity during the current AGN phase. Moreover, pc scale polarization maps display a well-resolved spine-sheath polarization structure. It seems that the jet direction of 0954+556 changed significantly during intermittent jet activity. This may explain the different jet orientations and spectral ages observed from kpc to pc scales. The research provides a strong case that AGN jet direction might change rapidly on timescales of one million years."

    "abstract": "Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

We introduce a class of transducers to model quantum gate semantics and develop composition algorithms for constructing transducers of parameterized circuits. Verification is reduced to functional inclusion or equivalence checking between SWTAs, for which we provide decision procedures. Our implementation demonstrates both the expressiveness and practical efficiency of the framework by verifying a diverse set of representative parameterized quantum programs with verification times ranging from milliseconds to seconds."

A key distinction between their analyses, however, lies in the geometries, e.g., smoothness notions, they rely on. In the convex setting, adaptive optimizers are governed by a stronger adaptive smoothness condition, while NSD relies on the standard notion of smoothness. We extend the theory of adaptive smoothness to the nonconvex setting and show that it precisely characterizes the convergence of adaptive optimizers. Moreover, we establish that adaptive smoothness enables acceleration of adaptive optimizers with Nesterov momentum in the convex setting, a guarantee unattainable under standard smoothness for certain non-Euclidean geometry. We further develop an analogous comparison for stochastic optimization by introducing adaptive gradient variance, which parallels adaptive smoothness and leads to dimension-free convergence guarantees that cannot be achieved under standard gradient variance for certain non-Euclidean geometry."

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models.

The research assesses the feasibility and systems-of-systems level adoption potential of UAM operations in the San Francisco Bay Area by comparing passenger departure, waiting, travel, and arrival times across key regional nodes, including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and Palo Alto airports, with conventional ground transportation. A multi-agent simulation was developed in MATLAB to evaluate the fleet operations and to model demand arrival using a Poisson process under stochastic passenger flows and turnaround constraints. Results indicate that utilizing UAM during peak demand could reduce total travel times up to eighty percent across the region. The findings of this paper highlight the critical operational factors for fleet schedule optimization. Especially how the fleet size, passengers' request volumes, and turnaround time directly influence waiting time, operating cost, and overall user acceptance."

    "abstract": "Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide us with a powerful way to explore the strong and highly dynamical regime of gravity theories. The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity."

Here, we demonstrate that the offset between galaxies and clusters arises naturally from cosmic time evolution. Using the evolving BTFR derived from the Nexus Paradigm of quantum gravity, we show that the normalization of the relation evolves as an exponential function of cosmic time., while the slope remains fixed at $\\sim 4$. This provides a simple and predictive framework in which both galaxies and clusters obey the same universal scaling law, with their apparent offset reflecting their different formation epochs. Our results unify mass-velocity scaling across five orders of magnitude in baryonic mass, offering new insights into cosmic structure formation."

This frequency range was selected because VLF radio waves are efficiently reflected by the lower ionospheric layers, and any changes in these layers lead to corresponding variations in the received signal. We have used a magnetic loop antenna for signal reception along with a low noise amplifier, analog-to-digital converter, and spectrum analyzer. Data was collected over the course of a few days, from a remote location with minimal electromagnetic interference.

The method exploits the band-sparsity of wireless channels in the delay-beamspace domain by solving a regularized optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward-backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables. We also propose a data-driven deep-unfolding based extension to improve the performance at a reduced number of iterations. We evaluate our channel estimators on ray-traced channels generated with SionnaRT. The results show that our methods significantly outperform linear methods such as linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation based on aggregate channel statistics, both in terms of raw estimation accuracy as well as in downstream performance."

To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation. Extensive experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks and manipulation policies demonstrate that ShapeForce delivers performance comparable to six-axis force-torque sensors at an extremely low cost."

Replication also causes a O$(10\\%)$ bias in the covariances, increasing with source redshift and $\\ell$, reaching $\\sim25\\%$ for $z_s=2.5$. We additionally show that replication leads to heavy biases (up to O$(100\\%)$ at high redshift) when performing gnomonic projection on a patch that is centered along a direction of replication.

We show that these effects remain in the presence of noise and smoothing scales typical of the DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, Euclid, and Roman surveys.

    "abstract": "In this paper we examine non-convex dynamic optimization problems with forward looking constraints. We prove that the recursive multiplier formulation in \\cite{marcet2019recursive} gives the optimal value if one assumes that the planner has access to a public randomization device and forward looking constraints only have to hold in expectations. Whether one formulates the functional equation as a sup-inf problem or as an inf-sup problem is essential for the timing of the optimal lottery and for determining which constraints have to hold in expectations. We discuss for which economic problems the use of lotteries can be considered a reasonable assumption. We provide a general method to recover the optimal policy from a solution of the functional equation. As an application of our results, we consider the Ramsey problem of optimal government policy and give examples where lotteries are essential for the optimal solution."

    "abstract": "The selective separation of same-charge ions is a longstanding challenge in resource recovery, battery recycling, and water treatment. Theoretical studies have shown that ratchet-based ion pumps (RBIPs) can separate ions with the same charge and valance by driving them in opposite directions according to their diffusion coefficients. This process relies on frequency dependent current reversal, a unique feature of ratchets in which the particle current direction is inverted with the input signal frequency. Previous experimental demonstrations of RBIPs achieved ion pumping against electrostatic forces and water deionization, but lacked frequency-dependent current reversal and control of the asymmetry of the device. Here, we report the first experimental realization of these key functionalities by driving RBIPs with a bipotentiostat. Complementary input signals applied to RBIP contacts unlock a flashing ratchet-like behavior, and enhances the device performance by an order of magnitude compared to the prior floating-drive approach. The enhanced control of the electrostatic potential at the RBIP surfaces leads to frequency dependent current reversals, and the addition of a potential offset to the input signal enables tuning the amplitude asymmetry of the device. This flashing ratchet functionality provides a significant step towards the realization of ratchet driven selective ion separation systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in LLM model sizes and the growing demand for long-context inference have made memory a critical bottleneck in GPU-accelerated serving systems. Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs."

For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes."

    "abstract": "While continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) has shown promise in adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing studies predominantly focus on models without safety alignment. This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines."

    "abstract": "Learned image compression (LIC) has recently benefited from Transformer based and state space model (SSM) based architectures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local high frequency details, whereas Transformers and SSMs provide strong long range modeling capabilities but may cause structural information loss or ignore frequency characteristics that are crucial for compression. In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters. On Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC, HCFSSNet reduces BD rate over the VTM anchor by 18.06, 24.56 and 22.44 percent, respectively, providing an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture for future learned image compression systems."

At the end of stable mass transfer, there is a well-known relation between the He WD mass and orbital period.

In this work, we modeled the evolution of WD binaries with stellar evolution code MESA and two types of opacity at low temperatures from Ferguson et al. (2005) and Freedman et al. (2008, 2014). We investigated the relation between the WD mass and orbital period and compared these results with observations. We find that the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) is below that from the opacity of Ferguson et al. (2005) and the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) can better explain the observations.

The proposed encoding method leverages the relative phases of three consecutive time bins to encode two bits per signal. The Sagnac loop configuration enables self-compensation for both phase and polarisation drifts, eliminating the need for active stabilisation. However, field deployments are subject to rapid phase fluctuations caused by external vibrations, which can degrade interference visibility. We used the first time bin for real-time phase-fluctuation monitoring. Although this monitoring reduces the effective key generation rate, the system achieved a secure key rate of approximately 1.5e-5 bits per pulse, with a corresponding visibility of up to 87% over a 50 km asymmetric optical fibre channel. These results demonstrate the practicality, stability, and scalability of the proposed three-time-bin TF-QKD protocol for real-world quantum communication networks."

Each period involves a worst-case maximization over distributions in a Wasserstein ball around the transition probability of a reference process with radius proportional to the length of the period, and the multi-period DRO problem arises through its sequential composition. We show that the scaling limit of the multi-period DRO, as the length of each period tends to zero, is a strongly continuous monotone semigroup on $\\mathrm{C_b}$. Furthermore, we show that its infinitesimal generator is equal to the generator associated with the non-robust scaling limit plus an additional perturbation term induced by the Wasserstein uncertainty. As an application, we show that when the reference process follows an Itô process, the viscosity solution of the associated nonlinear PDE coincides with the value of continuous-time robust optimization problems under parametric uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has been widely adopted to protect sensitive information in graph analytics. While edge-DP, which protects privacy at the edge level, has been extensively studied, node-DP, offering stronger protection for entire nodes and their incident edges, remains largely underexplored due to its technical challenges. A natural way to bridge this gap is to develop a general framework for reducing node-DP graph analytical tasks to edge-DP ones, enabling the reuse of existing edge-DP mechanisms. A straightforward solution based on group privacy divides the privacy budget by a given degree upper bound, but this leads to poor utility when the bound is set conservatively large to accommodate worst-case inputs. To address this, we propose node-to-edge (N2E), a general framework that reduces any node-DP graph analytical task to an edge-DP one, with the error dependency on the graph's true maximum degree. N2E introduces two novel techniques: a distance-preserving clipping mechanism that bounds edge distance between neighboring graphs after clipping, and the first node-DP mechanism for maximum degree approximation, enabling tight, privacy-preserving clipping thresholds. By instantiating N2E with existing edge-DP mechanisms, we obtain the first node-DP solutions for tasks such as maximum degree estimation. For edge counting, our method theoretically matches the error of the state-of-the-art, which is provably optimal, and significantly outperforms existing approaches for degree distribution estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves up to a 2.5x reduction in error for edge counting and up to an 80x reduction for degree distribution estimation."

We compute their tangent space and, under suitable assumptions, we prove an unobstructedness theorem in the spirit of Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have recently gained significant interest for their exceptional potential in recommendation tasks. This stems primarily from their prominent capability in distilling, modeling, and generating comprehensive user preferences. However, previous work fails to examine DMs in recommendation tasks through a rigorous lens. In this paper, we first experimentally investigate the completeness of recommender models from a thermodynamic view. We reveal that existing DM-based recommender models operate by maximizing the energy, while classic recommender models operate by reducing the entropy. Based on this finding, we propose a minimalistic diffusion framework that incorporates both factors via the maximization of Helmholtz free energy. Meanwhile, to foster the optimization, our reverse process is armed with a well-designed denoiser to maintain the inherent anisotropy, which measures the user-item cross-correlation in the context of bipartite graphs. Finally, we adopt an Acceptance-Rejection Gumbel Sampling Process (AR-GSP) to prioritize the far-outnumbered unobserved interactions for model robustness. AR-GSP integrates an acceptance-rejection sampling to ensure high-quality hard negative samples for general recommendation tasks, and a timestep-dependent Gumbel Softmax to handle an adaptive sampling strategy for diffusion models. Theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework has distinct superiority over baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "The configuration space, i.e. the Hilbert space, of compound quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of its subsystems: its dimensionality is given by the product of the dimensions of its constituents. Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions."

The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation."

    "abstract": "During the summer season of 2025, noctilucent clouds (NLC) were observed at the latitudes 55-60N from the late May until the late August. A distinct 5-day periodicity in their occurrence emerged following the summer solstice. Analysis of EOS Aura/MLS satellite data revealed that this effect was driven by a westward 5-day planetary wave, the amplitude of which was twice that of any previous northern summer since the start of the EOS Aura measurements in 2005. This study details the evolution of this exceptional planetary wave throughout the summer. Furthermore, NLC altitudes were determined via triangulation and colorimetry and were compared with MLS temperature profiles, enabling the determination of a mean positive phase lag for NLC occurrence relative to the temperature minimum."

To analyze this data in situ, real-time spatiotemporal processing is needed. However, current stream processing systems designed for IoT environments often lack spatiotemporal processing capabilities, and existing spatiotemporal libraries primarily focus on analyzing historical data. This gap makes performing real-time spatiotemporal analytics challenging. In this demonstration, we present NebulaMEOS, which combines MEOS (Mobility Engine Open Source), a spatiotemporal processing library, with NebulaStream, a scalable data management system for IoT applications. By integrating MEOS into NebulaStream, NebulaMEOS utilizes spatiotemporal functionalities to process and analyze streaming data in real-time. We demonstrate NebulaMEOS by querying data streamed from edge devices on trains by the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Belges (SNCB). Visitors can experience demonstrations of geofencing and geospatial complex event processing, visualizing real-time train operations and environmental impacts."

    "abstract": "A strong classical color field, known as the glasma, is generated in the earliest stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and can significantly influence the momentum and spin dynamics of hard probes such as quarks and jets. Most existing studies based on the classical equations of motion in a background Yang-Mills field, such as Wong equations, may not capture the full range of effects, for example, they neglect the Stern-Gerlach force experienced by spinning particles in non-uniform glasma fields. Although several extensions of Wong equations have been proposed to include spin degrees of freedom, they generally fail to satisfy all the required conditions simultaneously, such as Lorentz covariance, allowance for an arbitrary chromomagnetic moment, and respect for the necessary physical constraints. In this work, we extend the framework of a relativistic classical spinning particle in an electromagnetic field to describe spin one-half quarks propagating in a background non-Abelian Yang-Mills field. By systematically applying the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we derive self-consistent equations of motion for the particle's coordinates, momenta, spin, and color charge that satisfy all these requirements. This formalism provides a more complete and physically relevant description for studying momentum diffusion and spin polarization phenomena of hard probes in the glasma."

    "abstract": "Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \\textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection."

In the framework of this approach we discuss the dependence of quarkonia production on the multiplicity of the accompanying hadrons. In this paper we used the three gluons fusion mechanism for quarkonia production, without assuming the multiplicity dependence of the saturation scale.

Using TESS data and photometric follow-up observations with ASTEP, CHEOPS, and EulerCam, we show that one transit was initially misattributed and that the system consists of three transiting giant planets with orbital periods of 11.5, 22.6, and 48.9 days. The planets have radii of 0.65, 0.96, and 0.94 R_J, making them the largest known trio of transiting planets. The system architecture lies near a 4:2:1 mean motion resonant chain, inducing large transit timing variations for all three planets. Photodynamical modeling gives mass estimates of 0.057, 0.41, and 0.60 M_J and favors low eccentricities and mutual inclinations. TOI-7510 is an interesting system for investigating the dynamical interactions and formation histories of compact systems of giant planets."

However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\\% and 94\\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets."

While traditional predict-verify speculation paradigm can break serial execution, its benefit remains limited, as it retains the full original workload and adds extra inference overhead. We observe that early agent steps often involve simple evidence-gathering, where correct actions can often be predicted without full reasoning. Building on these observations, we present SPAgent, an algorithm-system co-design framework that expands the role of speculation in search agents to reduce latency. Algorithmically, SPAgent introduces a two-phase adaptive speculation mechanism that selectively omits verification when safe. System-wise, a two-level scheduler regulates speculative requests based on engine load to ensure speculation remains beneficial. We implement SPAgent in real-world systems. Across extensive experimental settings, SPAgent achieves up to $1.65\\times$ end-to-end speedup while maintaining same or even achieving higher accuracy, enabling practical deployment of multi-step search agents."

The following open problem, posed 45 years ago, can be viwed as the converse of Tarski's plank problem (Bang's theorem): Is it true that if the total width of a collection of planks is sufficiently large, then the planks can be individually translated to cover a unit ball $B$? A translative covering of $B$ by planks is said to be non-dissective if the planks can be added one by one, in some order, such that the uncovered part remains connected at each step, and is empty at the end. Improving a classical result of Groemer, we show that every set of $C/ε^{7/4}$ planks of width $ε$ admits a non-dissective translative covering of $B$, provided $C$ is large enough. Our proof yields a low-complexity algorithm. We also establish the first nontrivial lower bound of $c/ε^{4/3}$ for this quantity."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment and recognize objects universally. Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of SAM-MI. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark, along with a 1.6$\\times$ speedup. We hope SAM-MI can serve as an alternative methodology to effectively equip the OVSS model with SAM."

Inspired by recent work in TFNP on multicollision-finding, we consider a generalization of the bit pigeonhole principle, denoted $t$-BPHP$_n^m$, asserting that there is a map from $[m]$ to $[n]$ ($m > (t-1)n$) such that each $i \\in [n]$ has fewer than $t$ preimages. We prove that any depth $N^{2-1/t-ε}$ proof in Res$(\\oplus)$ of $t$-BPHP$_n^{ctn}$ (for any constant $c \\geq 1$) must have exponential size. For the usual bit pigeonhole principle, we show that any depth $N^{2-ε}$ Res$(\\oplus)$ proof of BPHP$_n^{n+1}$ must have exponential size. As a byproduct of our proof, we obtain that any randomized parity decision tree for the collision-finding problem with $n+1$ pigeons and $n$ holes must have depth $Ω(n)$, which matches the upper bound coming from a deterministic decision tree. We also prove a lifting theorem for bounded-depth Res$(\\oplus)$ with a constant size gadget which lifts from $(p, q)$-DT-hardness, recently defined by Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay. By combining our lifting theorem with the $(Ω(n), Ω(n))$-DT-hardness of the $n$-variate Tseitin contradiction over a suitable expander, proved by Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay, we obtain an $N$-variate constant-width unsatisfiable CNF formula with $O(N)$ clauses for which any depth $N^{2-ε}$ Res$(\\oplus)$ proof requires size $\\exp(Ω(N^ε))$. Previously no superpolynomial lower bounds were known for Res$(\\oplus)$ proofs when the depth is superlinear in the size of the formula."

Using this fact, the paper defines a translation invariant measure and integration on certain subquotients of the geometric adeles of surfaces. This theory is considerably different from the theory of integration on analytic adeles of surfaces. After revising aspects of one-dimensional theory, the paper includes a full definition of two-dimensional geometric adeles. A number of their new topological properties are established. The new translation invariant measure and integration on selective subquotients of the geometric adeles is used for integrals of certain functions in a two-dimensional method describing the size of adelic cohomology groups of surfaces, without using standard adelic complexes. A formula for the Euler characteristic of the surface and its divisor in terms of integrals over subquotients of geometric adeles is proved. Using the Euler characteristic, a new two-dimensional adelic intersection number is introduced. For geometric surfaces it is a positive multiple of the standard intersection number. Several results in the previous study of geometric adeles are given new proofs."

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks. This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\". To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame."

However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon."

To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy."

    "abstract": "The timing of the lunar magma ocean (LMO) solidification is governed by its thermal evolution. A key geochronological observation is that all analyzed products of LMO solidification have ages (or age peaks) near 4.35 +/- 0.05 billion years ago (Ga), suggesting rapid solidification of the last ~40% of the LMO at that time. The ages raise two questions: (1) how was the final solidification of the LMO delayed for over 100 Myr (million years) from the Moon's formation, and (2) after such a delay, how did it solidify so quickly? These two aspects of the ages are inconsistent with models of early-fast solidification or slow-prolonged solidification, controlled by radiogenic heat production and convective cooling (even if slowed by a conductive lithosphere). We propose that both aspects can not only be explained by tidal heating of the LMO but are in fact robust and expected thermal evolution features of a magma ocean cooling while being tidally heated and, in the Moon's case, receding from the Earth. The delay in solidification is due to the LMO being trapped at a stable equilibrium between the enhanced tidal heating rate and the decreasing cooling rate. The rapid solidification at ~4.35 Ga occurs when the Moon retreats to the point where an unstable equilibrium is reached, where tidal heating is drastically reduced, rapidly cooling the Moon. Moreover, an unanticipated outcome of our modeling is that the farside of the Moon is predicted to be 20-60 deg C cooler than the nearside for ~10-100 Myr during the final solidification stage. This is consistent with previous studies indicating asymmetric crystallization of the LMO from the farside to the nearside, which leads to an older and less evolved farside crust than the nearside, consistent with the observed higher Mg# of farside anorthositic crust and the nearside concentration of H2O, KREEP, and high Fe-Ti components."

While images serve as the most fundamental modality for visual expression, content generation that aligns with the user intent requires effective, controllable high-resolution image manipulation mechanisms. However, existing approaches remain limited to low-resolution settings, typically supporting only up to 1K resolution. In this work, we introduce the task of high-resolution image editing and propose a test-time optimization framework to address it. Our method performs patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by a fine-grained detail transfer module and a novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches.

By interpreting the pressure field as a cubical complex and computing its sublevel- and superlevel-set filtrations, we identify degree-1 topological features corresponding respectively to anticyclones surrounded by low pressure and cyclones surrounded by high pressure. We quantify their intensity through total persistence and track their evolution over time using optimal matchings and Wasserstein distances between consecutive persistence diagrams. The method captures coherent, long-lived structures without requiring feature-tracking heuristics and reveals robust seasonal patterns: both cyclonic and anticyclonic 1-holes exhibit strong winter maxima and summer minima in total persistence, lifetime, and frequency. Cyclonic features are more persistent, more numerous, and longer-lived than their anticyclonic counterparts, consistent with the climatological dominance of the Icelandic Low in winter and the weaker, more transient nature of anticyclonic highs. Long trajectories correspond to known large-scale structures such as winter cyclonic deepening and blocking episodes. These results demonstrate that persistent homology provides an objective, filtering-free characterization of pressure-field organization and offers a topological framework to analyze the dynamics and variability of mid-latitude circulation."

This work shows that, within a natural class of quadratic, scale-free ledgers for branched networks, all three are different faces of a single structure controlled by one dimensionless index chi. Each edge carries a flux Q, an effective radius r, and a per-length ledger P(Q,r) encoding transport dissipation and structural burden. Under locality, evenness in Q, linear-response (quadratic) dependence, and an exact homogeneity ansatz in (Q,r), any admissible ledger reduces in the scale-free regime to the two-term form P(Q,r) = a Q^2 r^{-p} + b r^m. Local optimality then implies simultaneously: (i) a flux-radius power law with generalized Murray closures at degree-3 nodes; (ii) a Young-Herring-type vector balance with radius weights r^m and a fixed symmetric Y-junction angle; and (iii) an effective flux-only cost of Gilbert/branched-transport type with exponent beta. The exponents alpha and beta, the symmetric angle, and the split between transport and structural cost are all set by chi = m/(m+p) = beta/2. A rigidity theorem shows conversely that any quadratic ledger that yields power-law optimal radii and power-law flux-only cost on an open scaling cone must belong to this two-term family and obey the same Murray-Gilbert-Young dictionary. Examples for Poiseuille, diffusive, and geophysical trees illustrate how chi can be inferred from geometry and used as a falsifiable order parameter for scale-free branching architectures."

We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements."

To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities."

However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) added by wind-turbine wakes is of significant scientific value for understanding the wake recovery mechanisms. Furthermore, this physical quantity is a critical input for engineering applications. In this study, we propose a novel wake-added TKE prediction model capable of accurately predict the three-dimensional spatial distribution of wake-added TKE using only basic inflow and wind turbine operation conditions as inputs. The model consists of two sub-modules: one for calculating the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE and the other for determining the ground effect correction function. The calculation of the azimuthally-averaged wake-added TKE is based on the analytical solution derived from the corresponding wake-added TKE budget, while the ground effect correction function is determined using a unified functional form, owing to its self-similarity. To ensure the closure of these two sub-modules, we develop methods for determining all free parameters based on the large-eddy simulation (LES) cases. This results in an end-to-end prediction framework, enabling direct engineering applications of the proposed model. We compared the proposed model with LES calibration data and publicly available validation datasets from the literature, which include LES and wind tunnel experiments under various inflow and turbine operating conditions. The comparison results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the spatial distribution of wake-added TKE, particularly capturing the vertical asymmetry of wake-added TKE and the streamwise evolution of the hub-height wake-added TKE profile. The averaged normalized mean absolute error of the proposed model across all validation datasets is only 8.13%, demonstrating its robustness and broad applicability."

Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework."

Here we conduct global-scale atmospheric model simulations with different complexity, and we find that tropical precipitation in convective regions already transitions to a O(10 day) periodic oscillation state with a O(100 mm/day) amplitude at 305-310 K. This temperature is substantially lower than previously reported, and within reach in a century under a high carbon emission scenario. We attribute the onset of the periodic extreme precipitation to the intensification of convectively-coupled waves, which occurs at temperatures much lower than the radiative mechanism responsible for the transition around 320-325 K identified before."

While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation > 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research."

With the introduction of 5G, the support of UL-256QAM has been greatly improved due to a big re-haul of RAN by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, many RAN manufacturers charge MNOs for licenses to enable UL-256QAM per cell basis. This led to some MNOs hesitating to enable the feature on some of their gNodeB or cells to save cost. Since it's known that 256QAM modulation requires a very good channel condition to operate, but UE has a very limited transmission power budget. In this paper, 256QAM utilization, throughput and latency impact from enabling UL-256QAM will be evaluated on commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in two countries: Japan and Thailand on various frequency bands, mobility characteristics, and deployment schemes. By modifying the modem firmware, UL-256QAM can be turned off and compared to the conventional UL-64QAM. The results show that UL-256QAM utilization was less than 20% when deployed on a passive antenna network resulting in an average of 8.22% improvement in throughput. However, with Massive MIMO deployment, more than 50% utilization was possible on commercial networks. Furthermore, despite a small uplink throughput gain, enabling UL-256QAM can lower the latency when the link is fully loaded with an average improvement of 7.97 ms in TCP latency observed across various test cases with two TCP congestion control algorithms."

Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents ν\\approx1.50 and β\\approx0.65.

Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction. Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning. Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections. Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction."

    "abstract": "Polarons, quasiparticles formed through interactions between lattice and charge carriers (electrons and holes), strongly influence the electronic and optical properties of functional materials. In nanostructured BiVO$_{4}$, polaron formation and dynamics govern photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport, yet the microscopic nature remains not fully resolved. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report the formation of multi-centered polarons, in contrast to the more common single-centered states. Moreover, electron polarons exhibit pronounced anisotropy compared to the isotropic hole counterpart, reflecting a distinct character in charge-lattice coupling. These theoretical insights offer a direct interpretation of optical and spectroscopic experiments, providing strong evidence of anisotropic multi-centered polaronic behavior in BiVO$_{4}$. The presence of multiple in-gap states, especially from multi-centered polarons, introduces new channels for charge transport and recombination, possibly offering opportunities to control carrier dynamics in nanoscale photocatalytic and optoelectronic devices."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) service provisioning in wireless edge networks involves two phases: content generation on edge servers and content transmission to mobile devices. In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity. Building on the batch solution, we further optimize bandwidth allocation across AIGC services. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm in delivering high-quality, lower-latency AIGC services."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn ."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates how institutional learning and regional spillovers shape volatility dynamics in ASEAN equity markets. Using daily data for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand from 2010 to 2024, we construct a high-frequency institutional learning index via a MIDAS-EPU approach. Unlike existing studies that treat institutional quality as a static background characteristic, this paper models institutions as a dynamic mechanism that reacts to policy shocks, information pressure, and crisis events. Building on this perspective, we introduce two new volatility frameworks: the Institutional Response Dynamics Model (IRDM), which embeds crisis memory, policy shocks, and information flows; and the Network-Integrated IRDM (N-IRDM), which incorporates dynamic-correlation and institutional-similarity networks to capture cross-market transmission. Empirical results show that institutional learning amplifies short-run sensitivity to shocks yet accelerates post-crisis normalization. Crisis-memory terms explain prolonged volatility clustering, while network interactions improve tail behavior and short-horizon forecasts. Robustness checks using placebo and lagged networks indicate that spillovers reflect a strong regional common factor rather than dependence on specific correlation topologies. Diebold-Mariano and ENCNEW tests confirm that the N-IRDM significantly outperforms baseline GARCH benchmarks. The findings highlight a dual role of institutions and offer policy insights on transparency enhancement, macroprudential communication, and coordinated regional governance."

Furthermore, we provide an explicit rate of convergence that depends on the regularity of the interaction potential."

    "abstract": "Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architectures have enabled a new frontier in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs), offering superior performance by activating only a fraction of their total parameters during inference. However, their practical deployment is severely hampered by substantial static memory overhead, as all experts must be loaded into memory. Existing post-training pruning methods, while reducing model size, often derive their pruning criteria from a single, general-purpose corpus. This leads to a critical limitation: a catastrophic performance degradation when the pruned model is applied to other domains, necessitating a costly re-pruning for each new domain. To address this generalization gap, we introduce Mosaic Pruning (MoP). The core idea of MoP is to construct a functionally comprehensive set of experts through a structured ``cluster-then-select\" process. This process leverages a similarity metric that captures expert performance across different task domains to functionally cluster the experts, and subsequently selects the most representative expert from each cluster based on our proposed Activation Variability Score. Unlike methods that optimize for a single corpus, our proposed Mosaic Pruning ensures that the pruned model retains a functionally complementary set of experts, much like the tiles of a mosaic that together form a complete picture of the original model's capabilities, enabling it to handle diverse downstream tasks.Extensive experiments on various MoE models demonstrate the superiority of our approach. MoP significantly outperforms prior work, achieving a 7.24\\% gain on general tasks and 8.92\\% on specialized tasks like math reasoning and code generation."

The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes.

The aim is to allow rewrites to alter the structure and syntactic outcome of an original query while keeping the obtainable insights intact. This drastically differs from traditional query rewriting, which typically aims to decrease query evaluation time by using strict equivalence rules and optimization heuristics on the query plan. Rewriting queries to queries that only provide a similar insight but otherwise can be entirely different can remedy inaccessible original data tables due to access control, privacy, or expensive data access regarding monetary cost or remote access. In this paper, we put forward INQURE, a system designed for INtent-based QUery REwriting. It uses access to a large language model (LLM) for the query understanding and human-like derivation of alternate queries. Around the LLM, INQURE employs upfront table filtering and subsequent candidate rewrite pruning and ranking. We report on the results of an evaluation using a benchmark set of over 900 database table schemas and discuss the pros and cons of alternate approaches regarding runtime and quality of the rewrites of a user study."

    "abstract": "Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used for learning on graphs, but their ability to process long-range information is limited by the phenomenon of oversquashing. This limitation has led some researchers to advocate Graph Transformers as a better alternative, whereas others suggest that it can be mitigated within the MPNN framework, using virtual nodes or other rewiring techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that oversquashing is not limited to long-range tasks, but can also arise in short-range problems. This observation allows us to disentangle two distinct mechanisms underlying oversquashing: (1) the bottleneck phenomenon, which can arise even in low-range settings, and (2) the vanishing gradient phenomenon, which is closely associated with long-range tasks. We further show that the short-range bottleneck effect is not captured by existing explanations for oversquashing, and that adding virtual nodes does not resolve it. In contrast, transformers do succeed in such tasks, positioning them as the more compelling solution to oversquashing, compared to specialized MPNNs."

Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation."

The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed."

    "abstract": "The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $δ$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-δ''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators."

While for the former, heavy-ion collisions (HIC) represent a unique opportunity to constraint the EOS in a controlled laboratory setting, the latter can be precisely probed thanks to the advent of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA). However, as we move away from our understanding drawn from individual sources and limited statistics to the era of precision physics with improved datasets, the need for a systematic way to combine them becomes clear. In this article, we trace the individual methods for extracting the EOS both for HIC and MMA. We then review the current state-of-the-art efforts to combine these individual information sources from Bayesian multi-source analysis, e.g., the Nuclear Physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) and Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) frameworks, and fully integrated EOS frameworks, i.e., the Modular Unified Solver for the Equation of State (MUSES) calculation engine. We highlight the scientific advances made possible by each step and outline the remaining challenges that must be addressed to build a coherent, predictive picture of dense nuclear matter across all relevant regimes."

We present an approach that converts an interleaving-based correctness proof, as generated by many algorithmic verifiers, into a thread-modular correctness proof in the style of Owicki and Gries. We automatically synthesize ghost variables that capture the relevant interleaving information, and abstract away irrelevant details. Our evaluation shows that the approach is efficient in practice and generates compact proofs, compared to a baseline."

In this continuum model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the boundary measurements are realized as a noisy perturbation of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map's integral kernel. The theoretical analysis proceeds by extending the domain of the inversion operator to a Hilbert space of kernel functions. The resulting extension shares the same stability properties as the original inverse map from kernels to conductivities, but is now amenable to neural operator approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Fourier neural operators excel at reconstructing infinite-dimensional piecewise constant and lognormal conductivities in noisy setups both within and beyond the theory's assumptions. The methodology developed in this paper for EIT exemplifies a broader strategy for addressing nonlinear inverse problems with a noise-aware operator learning framework."

Here, we propose that the frequency-dependent lattice thermal conductivity, $κ(ν)$, provides a direct signature of coherent transport. Specifically, we show that peaks in $κ(ν)$ arise from the frequency nesting of modes with identical wave vectors. Applying this approach to CuCl, we identify clear signatures of coherent transport in its dynamical lattice thermal conductivity. We revisit the interpretation of thermoreflectance experiments and argue that the conventional understanding breaks down in strongly anharmonic crystals, alloys, and amorphous materials. Finally, we discuss experimental pathways to measure $κ(ν)$, offering a new route to verify coherent contributions in thermal transport."

This paper considers a generalisation of this problem to \\emph{temporal graphs}, i.e., to graphs whose structure changes according to an ordered sequence of edge sets. In the simultaneous resource updating problem on temporal graphs, the resources which can be accessed will change, however, the necessity of symmetry breaking to avoid conflicts remains. In this paper, we focus on the problem of \\emph{maintaining proper colourings} on temporal graphs in general, with a particular focus on bipartite colourings. Our aim is to minimise the total number of times that the vertices change colour, or, in the form of a decision problem, whether we can maintain a proper colouring by allowing not more colour changes than some given \\emph{budget}. On the negative side, we show that, despite bipartite colouring being easy on static graphs, the problem of maintaining such a colouring on graphs that are bipartite in each snapshot is NP-Hard to even approximate within \\emph{any} constant factor unless the Unique Games Conjecture fails. On the positive side, we provide an exact algorithm for a temporal graph with $n$ vertices, a lifetime $T$ and at most $k$ components in any given snapshot in $O(T \\vert E \\vert 2^{k} + n T 2^{2k})$ time, and an $O\\left(\\sqrt{\\log(nT)}\\right)$-factor approximation algorithm running in $\\tilde{O}((nT)^3)$ time.

In this study, we examine how the data coverage influences the reliability of parameter estimation within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework. Using OJ 287, TXS 0506+056, and Mrk 421 as representative of the low-, intermediate- and high synchrotron peak classes (LSP, ISP and HSP), respectively, we generate synthetic SEDs based on their best-fit models and perform 1,000 fits for each of the 21 observational configurations per source type. Our analysis quantifies the coverage probability for all model parameters, such has the magnetic field strength and the electron luminosity, and reveals that different blazar subclasses exhibit distinct sensitivities to spectral gaps. For LSPs, a minimal dataset comprising optical/UV, X-ray, and GeV $γ$-ray bands is sufficient for robust parameter inference. In contrast, ISPs and HSPs require broader spectral coverage to constrain the physical parameters. For ISP, we find that reliable parameter recovery can be achieved with two different minimal band combinations: \\textit{(i)} X-ray, high energy $γ$-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray data, or \\textit{(ii)} optical/UV, X-ray, and high energy $γ$-ray data. For HSPs, the minimal configuration enabling reliable parameter recovery includes the optical/UV, X-ray, and very high energy $γ$-ray bands. We discuss the role of very high energy $γ$-ray observations, showing that they significantly enhance parameter recovery for HSPs. Our results provide practical guidelines for designing optimized multi-wavelength observation campaigns and for assessing the robustness of SSC model inferences under incomplete spectral coverage."

    "abstract": "Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), which is recognized as a key enabler for sixth generation (6G), has brought new opportunities for intelligent, sustainable, and connected wireless networks. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver technology lies at the core of this paradigm, providing the degrees of freedom required for simultaneous data transmission and accurate radar sensing. The tight integration of sensing and communication introduces unique security vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional physical-layer security (PLS). In particular, high-power transmissions directed at sensing targets may empower adversarial eavesdroppers, whereas passive interception of ISAC echoes can reveal sensitive information such as target locations and mobility patterns. This article presents an overview of recent advances in MIMO ISAC transceiver design, considering transmitter perspectives, receiver architectures, and full-duplex implementations. We examine MIMO transceiver designs under unique security threats specific to ISAC and highlight emerging countermeasures, including secure signaling design, interference exploitation, and transceiver optimization under adversarial conditions. Finally, we discuss challenges and research opportunities for developing secure ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance."

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff in user representation learning is essential for improving recommendation quality in modern content platforms. While well studied in static settings, this tradeoff becomes significantly more complex when content creators strategically adapt to platform incentives. To analyze how such competition reshapes the tradeoff for maximizing user welfare, we introduce the Content Creator Competition with Bias-Variance Tradeoff framework, a tractable game-theoretic model that captures the platform's decision on regularization strength in user feature estimation. We derive and compare the platform's optimal policy under two key settings: a non-strategic baseline with fixed content and a strategic environment where creators compete in response to the platform's algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis in a stylized model shows that, compared to the non-strategic environment, content creator competition shifts the platform's optimal policy toward weaker regularization, thereby favoring lower bias in the bias-variance tradeoff. To validate and assess the robustness of these insights beyond the stylized setting, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The empirical results consistently support our theoretical conclusion: in strategic environments, reducing bias leads to higher user welfare. These findings offer practical implications for the design of real-world recommendation algorithms in the presence of content creator competition."

Racetrack memory requires current densities high enough to generate velocities above 50 m/s, but such conditions also enhance spin-current noise. We develop a theoretical framework based on the stochastic Thiele equation to analyze the effects of equilibrium (thermal) and nonequilibrium (spin-current) fluctuations on skyrmion dynamics. From this approach, we derive diffusion coefficients and mean-squared displacements that quantify stochastic motion under both noise sources. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin-current noise dominates skyrmion dynamics in typical racetrack structures up to room temperature. We further address the first-passage-time problem, obtaining the mean first-passage time and its standard deviation along and across the racetrack. These results quantify how random displacements affect skyrmion propagation and detection, providing insights into error sources in high-speed racetrack memory devices."

While heterogeneous agent models offer a more realistic alternative to representative agent frameworks, their implementation poses significant computational challenges, particularly in continuous time. The Aiyagari-Bewley-Huggett (ABH) framework, recast as a system of partial differential equations, typically relies on grid-based solvers that suffer from the curse of dimensionality, high computational cost, and numerical inaccuracies. This paper introduces the ABH-PINN solver, an approach based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embeds the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov Forward equations directly into the neural network training objective. By replacing grid-based approximation with mesh-free, differentiable function learning, the ABH-PINN solver benefits from the advantages of PINNs of improved scalability, smoother solutions, and computational efficiency. Preliminary results show that the PINN-based approach is able to obtain economically valid results matching the established finite-difference solvers."

Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively.

    "abstract": "Adaptive optimizers such as Adam have achieved great success in training large-scale models like large language models and diffusion models. However, they often generalize worse than non-adaptive methods, such as SGD on classical architectures like CNNs. We identify a key cause of this performance gap: adaptivity in pre-conditioners, which limits the optimizer's ability to adapt to diverse optimization landscapes. To address this, we propose Anon (Adaptivity Non-restricted Optimizer with Novel convergence technique), a novel optimizer with continuously tunable adaptivity , allowing it to interpolate between SGD-like and Adam-like behaviors and even extrapolate beyond both. To ensure convergence across the entire adaptivity spectrum, we introduce incremental delay update (IDU), a novel mechanism that is more flexible than AMSGrad's hard max-tracking strategy and enhances robustness to gradient noise. We theoretically establish convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex settings. Empirically, Anon consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on representative image classification, diffusion, and language modeling tasks. These results demonstrate that adaptivity can serve as a valuable tunable design principle, and Anon provides the first unified and reliable framework capable of bridging the gap between classical and modern optimizers and surpassing their advantageous properties."

    "abstract": "Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP"

    "abstract": "WhatsApp, with 3.5 billion active accounts as of early 2025, is the world's largest instant messaging platform. Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication. To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting. Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures. Moreover, we were able to perform a census of WhatsApp users, providing a glimpse on the macroscopic insights a large messaging service is able to generate even though the messages themselves are end-to-end encrypted. Using the gathered data, we also discovered the re-use of certain X25519 keys across different devices and phone numbers, indicating either insecure (custom) implementations, or fraudulent activity. In this updated version of the paper, we also provide insights into the collaborative remediation process through which we confirmed that the underlying rate-limiting issue had been resolved."

    "abstract": "Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis."

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments."

In this work, we investigate the role of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for DTN routing under uncertainty. We introduce and evaluate a novel model: Dependent Node Failures (DNF), which captures correlated node failures via repairable node states modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). We implement the model using JuliaPOMDP and integrate it with DTN simulations via DtnSim. Our evaluation demonstrates that POMDP-based routing yields improved delivery ratios and delay performance under uncertain conditions while maintaining scalability. These results highlight the potential of POMDPs as a principled foundation for decision-making in future DTN deployments."

The standard point-object model for detection-based sensors is enhanced so that the probability of detection considers the presence of all objects. A principled tracking method is derived, assigning each object an expected probability of detection, where the expectation is taken over the reduced Palm density, which means conditionally on the object's existence. The assigned probability thus considers the object's visibility relative to the sensor, under the presence of other objects. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method systematically accounts for uncertainties related to all objects in a clear and manageable way. The method is demonstrated through a visual tracking application using the multi-Bernoulli mixture (MBM) filter with marks."

The pressure drop is given between the channel inlet and outlet. At the initial moment of time, the channel walls are contaminated with adhered particles, i.e. the walls are uneven, which affects the formation of the flow structure through the channel. Over time, under the action of viscous stresses and thermal noise, the particles break away from the channel walls, causing its cleaning. The interaction of the detached particles with the flow is taken into account in the Stokes approximation. In addition, the model takes into account random particle motion caused by diffusion. The problem is solved numerically within the framework of the random walk model. The evolution of the liquid flow in the channel during its cleaning is obtained: stream function, pressure, and vorticity fields. The dependencies of the volume occupied by settled particles, the flow rate through the channel and the channel gap on time are determined for different values of the interaction force between particles and channel wall. The estimations of the channel cleaning time are obtained and discussed. The possibility of control the cleaning process by the modulation of liquid flux through the channel is investigated. It is shown that resonance phenomena can be observed. The dependencies of cleaning time on the modulation amplitude and frequency is obtained and studied. It is shown that changing the modulation parameters leads to a significant change in the cleaning time and helps control the cleaning process."

Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\\% SLA compliance but is \\emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \\$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms."

    "abstract": "Approximating complex, high-dimensional, and computationally expensive functions is a central problem in science and engineering. Standard sparse grids offer a powerful solution by mitigating the curse of dimensionality compared to full tensor grids. However, they treat all regions of the domain isotropically, which may not be efficient for functions with localized or anisotropic behavior. This work presents a surrogate-informed framework for constructing sparse grid interpolants, which is guided by an error indicator that serves as a zero-cost estimate for the hierarchical surplus. This indicator is calculated for all candidate points, defined as those in the next-level grid $w+1$ not already present in the base grid $w$. It quantifies the local approximation error by measuring the relative difference between the predictions of two consecutive interpolants of level $w$ and $w-1$. The candidates are then ranked by this metric to select the most impactful points for refinement up to a given budget or following another criterion, as, e.g., a given threshold in the error indicator. The final higher-order model is then constructed using a surrogate-informed approach: the objective function is evaluated only at the selected high-priority points, while for the remaining nodes of the $w+1$ grid, we assign the values predicted by the initial $w$-level surrogate. This strategy significantly reduces the required number of expensive evaluations, yielding a final model that closely approximates the accuracy of a fully-resolved $w+1$ grid at a fraction of the computational cost. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed surrogate-informed refinement criterion is demonstrated for several analytic function and for a real engineering problem, i.e., the analysis of sensitivity to geometrical parameters of numerically predicted flashback phenomenon in hydrogen-fueled perforated burners."

Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models.

Such observations are essential for constraining source localization, determining the source type, and understanding emission mechanisms. Typically, they require following up a neutrino alert (IceCube issues two alert streams: Gold, with at least 50 percent probability of astrophysical origin, and Bronze, with at least 30 percent probability) with an electromagnetic facility, primarily in X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Another approach involves electromagnetic monitoring of hot spots in the IceCube skymap, i.e., positions exceeding the instrument sensitivity. An alternative method consists in performing correlation analysis across available neutrino events and source catalogs. We searched for spatial coincidence between galaxies from SDSS and high-energy neutrino events. The analysis includes IceCube Gold alerts and neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events from AMON (Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network), identified through the end of September 2025. We examined galaxies from the morphological catalog at redshifts 0.02 to 0.1, which contains 315,776 SDSS DR9 objects with absolute stellar magnitudes in the range from -24 to -13 in the r band. Among 59 IceCube Gold alerts, we found three with only one galaxy (SDSS J231231.52+033415.1) within the 50 percent containment radius. Among 24 neutrino-electromagnetic coincidence events, three more contain only one galaxy (SDSS J220711.14+122535.9) within the same radius.

The coupling preserves the energy conserving structure of the low order dynamics solver, while the high order material transport scheme is provably tracer variance conserving, or damping with the inclusion of upwinding. The two methods are coupled via the multigrid hierarchy of the low order dynamics solver, with the basis functions of the high order transport being collocated at the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points with the low order dynamics on the finest scale multigrid mesh. Standard test cases are presented to verify the consistency and conservation properties of the method. While the overall scheme is limited by the formal order of accuracy of the low order dynamics, the use of high order, tracer variance conserving transport is shown to preserve richer turbulent solutions without compromising model stability compared to a purely low order method."

Previous studies have not considered the influence of the magnetic field within the Crab Nebula. The magnetic field plays a crucial role through the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) process, in which high-energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation that is subsequently up-scattered by the same electrons via inverse Compton scattering to generate gamma rays. Therefore, neglecting the magnetic field in modeling leads to theoretical inconsistencies. In this work, we investigate the significance of the magnetic field effect and demonstrate that even differences in magnetic field modeling can substantially alter the conversion probability. We thus, for the first time, point out that proper consideration of the magnetic field is essential in ALP searches using gamma rays from the Crab Nebula. The resulting constraints reach up to a coupling of $g_{aγγ} \\lesssim 1 \\times 10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses in the range $10^{-10} {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-6} {\\rm eV}$."

    "abstract": "Stochastic convex optimization problems with nonlinear functional constraints are ubiquitous in machine learning applications, including multi-task learning, structured prediction, and multi-view learning. The presence of nonlinear functional constraints renders the traditional projected stochastic gradient descent and related projection-based methods inefficient, and motivates the use of first-order methods. However, existing first-order methods, including primal and primal-dual algorithms, typically rely on a bounded (sub-)gradient assumption, which may be too restrictive in many settings. We propose a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) algorithm that works entirely in the primal domain, avoids projecting onto the feasible region, obviates the need for bounded gradients, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. A faster version, namely SSQP-Skip, is also proposed where the quadratic subproblems can be skipped in most iterations. Finally, we develop an accelerated variance-reduced version of SSQP (VARAS), whose oracle complexity bounds match those for solving unconstrained finite-sum convex optimization problems. The superior performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments on real datasets."

Here we investigate whether relaxing the symmetry requirements can improve operational performance, focusing on virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits. We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning. Despite these improvements, the resulting virtual broadcasting map remains sample-inefficient and is therefore still operationally impractical."

    "abstract": "The proactive prediction of anomalies (AP) in multivariate time series (MTS) is a critical challenge to ensure system dependability. The difficulty lies in identifying subtle anomaly precursors concealed within normal signals. However, existing unsupervised methods, trained exclusively on normal data, demonstrate a fundamental propensity to reconstruct normal patterns. Consequently, when confronted with weak precursors, their predictions are dominated by the normal pattern, submerging the very signal required for prediction. To contend with the limitation, we propose RED-F, a Reconstruction-Elimination based Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting framework, comprising the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). The REM utilizes a hybrid time-frequency mechanism to mitigate the precursor, generating a purified, normal-pattern baseline. The DFM then receives this purified baseline and the original sequence which retains the precursor as parallel inputs. At the core of our framework, RED-F employs a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult task of absolute signal detection into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictive streams. This contrastive mechanism serves to amplify the faint precursor signal. Furthermore, the DFM is trained with a novel Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) objective, which leverages distant future context to enhance its predictive sensitivity. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks."

    "abstract": "Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models."

We analyze both the trade-off and the ratio between the achievable secrecy sum-rate and total power consumption. In the special case of two backscatter devices (BDs), we derive closed-form solutions for the optimal reflection coefficients and power allocation by exploiting the structure of the SEE objective and the Pareto boundary of the feasible set. When more than two BDs are present, the problem becomes analytically intractable. To address this, we propose two efficient optimization techniques: (i) an exhaustive grid-based benchmark method, and (ii) a scalable particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we design a deep learning-based predictor using a feedforward neural network (FNN), which closely approximates the optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the inclusion of AmBC significantly improves SEE, with gains up to 615% compared to conventional NOMA in high-noise regimes. Additionally, the FNN model achieves more than 95% accuracy compared to the optimal baseline, while reducing complexity. Finally, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the learned model, revealing that the most influential features correspond to the dominant composite channel components, in accordance with the theoretical system model.

    "abstract": "Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores."

    "abstract": "To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D."

    "abstract": "Spatial reasoning is a critical capability for intelligent robots, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) still fall short of human-level performance in video-based spatial reasoning. This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information. This design enables efficient and long-horizon spatial reasoning with a fixed computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance among video-only models, significantly advancing the frontier of visual-spatial intelligence."

    "abstract": "Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition."

MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control.

    "abstract": "Optimal routing in quantum-repeater networks requires finding the best path that connects a pair of end nodes. Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models."

We answer this question by presenting a method to extract geometrically $k$-local conserved operators that have the given infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) in 2D as an (approximate) eigenstate. The key ingredient is the evaluation of the static structure factors of multi-site operators through differentiating the generating function. Despite the approximation errors, we show that our method is still able to extract from exact or variational iPEPS to good precision both frustration-free and non-frustration-free parent Hamiltonians that are beyond the standard construction and obtain better locality. In particular, we find a 4-site-plaquette local Hamiltonian that approximately has the short-range RVB state as the ground state. Moreover, we find a Hamiltonian that has the deformed toric code state at any string tension as excited eigenstates at the same energy, which might be potential candidates for quantum many-body scars."

    "abstract": "Zigzag chains allow for the formation of topological edge states. Several distinct chain architectures have been developed for this purpose. Here, we report a zigzag superlattice, containing two staggered sub-lattices, that supports multiple edge states, including higher-order modes. In such lattices, the intra- and intercell coupling is imbalanced by the tunneling effect of the eigenstates or deformation of the higher-order modes. We demonstrate that by arranging the zigzag superlattice into a curved shape, some of the edge states transition into bulk states as the curvature of the lattice increases, while some bulk states become more localized towards edge states. The reason is that a curved superlattice strengthens the intra-lattice coupling of the inner sub-lattice due to the separation reduction of the potential wells. %which, on the one hand, hinders the tunneling of the eigenstate to the outer sub-lattice and hence weakens the edge states formed in the inner sub-lattice. On the other hand, it can isolate more edge states formed in the outer sub-lattice, because of the induced more intensive deformation of the higher-order modes in the inner sub-lattice. We also show that some bulk states at larger curvatures can be transformed into edge states by a repulsive nonlinearity, which also enables the coexistence of different edge states. As a specific and ideal platform for realizing such topological superlattices we explore exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities with their strong nonlinearity and possibility for optical excitation and control. Our work introduces an additional dimension for the design of complex topological lattices and functional photonic devices."

    "abstract": "Associative memory models are content-addressable memory systems fundamental to biological intelligence and are notable for their high interpretability. However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning."

These distinct directions have been elegantly woven together: delicate and multigap topological insulators have peculiar features in quantum geometry that can be conveniently captured by bundle gerbes. This viewpoint exposes the recently identified quantization of a non-linear optical response and provides outlooks for its realization in crystalline solids."

Based on measure-valued extensions of the objective function, so-called relaxations, $\\ell^2$-approximation, and entropy-regularization, we derive several tractable problem formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent as well as with closed-form solutions. The limits of applying tractable versions of such relaxations to sums of bivariates are investigated using general results for reconstructing measures from their bivariate marginals. Experiments in which the derived algorithms are applied to random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems provide insights into qualitatively different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates."

We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature.

In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\\%FPR (6.42\\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr.

This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dynamics, which limits their ability to adaptively model the full spectrum of temporal variations and impairs their performance on unpredictable, Sudden, high-magnitude events. To address this, we introduce the Multi-scale Temporal Network (MSTN), a novel deep learning architecture founded on a hierarchical multi-scale and sequence modeling principle. The MSTN framework integrates: (i) a multi-scale convolutional encoder that constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid for local patterns (ii) a sequence modeling component for long-range temporal dependencies. We empirically validate this with BiLSTM and Transformer variants, establishing a flexible foundation for future architectural advancements. and (iii) a gated fusion mechanism augmented with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) and multi-head temporal attention (MHTA) for dynamic, context-aware feature integration. This design enables MSTN to adaptively model temporal patterns from milliseconds to long-range dependencies within a unified framework. Extensive evaluations across time-series long-horizon forecasting, imputation, classification and generalizability study demonstrate that MSTN achieves competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, showing improvements over contemporary approaches including EMTSF, LLM4TS, HiMTM, TIME-LLM, MTST, SOFTS, iTransformer, TimesNet, and PatchTST.

Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performance at the circuit level. In this work, we introduce local single-shot checks, where we impose constraints on check weights. Using a dynamic measurement scheme, we show that the number of required measurement rounds can be reduced by a factor determined by this constraint. As an example, we show through numerical simulation that our scheme can improve decoding performance compared to conventional checks when using sliding-window decoding with a reduced window size under circuit-level noise models for toric codes. Our work provides a new direction for constructing checks that can reduce time overhead in large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation."

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) model is trained with synthetic data that emulates in situ displacement measurements in the host rock and at the cavity wall, obtained from extensometers and convergence monitoring. As acquiring field observations can be costly, a sequential training approach based on active learning is implemented to determine the most informative locations for new sensors. In particular, Monte Carlo dropout is used to quantify epistemic uncertainty and query measurements in regions where the model is least confident. This approach reduces the amount of required field data and optimizes sensor placement. The PINN is tested to reconstruct the displacement field around a deep tunnel of circular section excavated in transversely isotropic elastic rock and to determine rock constitutive and stress-field parameters. Results demonstrate excellent performance on small, scattered, and noisy datasets, achieving high precision for the Young's moduli, shear modulus, horizontal-to-vertical far-field stress ratio, and the orientation of the bedding planes. The proposed framework shall ultimately support decision-making for optimal subsurface monitoring and for adaptive tunnel design and control."

Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics."

    "abstract": "We study the threshold of gravitational collapse in spherically symmetric spacetimes governed by the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov equations. We numerically construct solutions describing a collapsing distribution of charged matter that either forms a charged black hole or eventually disperses. We first consider a region of parameter space where the solutions at the threshold of black hole formation are stationary, horizonless shells. These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging. Beyond the critical point, we find a new region of parameter space where the threshold solution is an extremal black hole. We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes. If a similar picture to the one found here holds for known families of stationary solutions of rotating matter that approach the exterior of an extremal Kerr spacetime, they could provide a route to forming an extremal spinning black hole."

    "abstract": "Runaway stars depart their birthplaces with high peculiar velocities. Two mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain their origin, the binary supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the kinematic properties of runaway stars is key to understanding their origins.We intend to investigate the origins of 39 B-type runaway stars from LAMOST using orbital traceback analysis. From the catalog of LAMOST, we selected 39 B-type runaway stars and determined their spectral subtypes from key absorption lines. We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmospheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins. Through orbital traceback, we find that 29 stars have trajectories entirely within the Galactic disk, whereas 10 are disk-passing yet still trace back to the disk. Two stars have trajectories that intersect those of known clusters. Their orbits show similar morphologies in both the $X-Y$ and $R-Z$ planes, and their [M/H] values are comparable, suggesting possible cluster origins. However, definitive confirmation will require additional evidence. In addition, the $V_{\\rm Sp} - v\\sin{i}$ plane shows that runaway stars with low peculiar space velocities but high $v\\sin{i}$ remain on the Galactic disk, whereas those with high peculiar space velocities but low $v\\sin{i}$ pass through the disk, possibly reflecting two distinct origins."

We also provide additional equivalent geometric and group-theoretic characterizations of strong solidity for Coxeter groups that allow us to completely classify those with a strongly solid group von Neumann algebra. In particular, we characterize strong solidity purely in terms of the defining Coxeter-Dynkin diagram."

For many engineering systems, however, first-principles, model-based identification is impractical, motivating data-driven approaches for Digital Twins used in control and diagnostics. In this paper, we present RFE-DMDc, a supervised, data-driven workflow that uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select a minimal, physically meaningful set of variables to monitor and then derives a linear state-space model via Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc). The workflow includes a cross-subsystem selection step that mitigates feature \\textit{overshadowing} in multi-component systems. To corroborate the results, we implement a GA-DMDc baseline that jointly optimizes the state set and model fit under a common accuracy cost on states and outputs. Across a truth-known RLC benchmark and a realistic Integrated Energy System (IES) with multiple thermally coupled components and thousands of candidate variables, RFE-DMDc consistently recovers compact state sets (\\(\\approx 10\\) variables) that achieve test errors comparable to GA-DMDc while requiring an order of magnitude less computational time. The selected variables retain clear physical interpretation across subsystems, and the resulting models demonstrate competitive predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to overfitting."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon."

While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to process redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Additionally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical importance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incorporates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21\\% reduction in gas saturation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy."

Extending previous observations, we show that the non-linear equations governing giant vortices can essentially be solved exactly. The solutions fall into different universality classes, reflecting the properties of the Higgs potential, that become sharply distinct phases in the large-n limit. We use this understanding to shed light on the binding energies and stability of vortex strings in each universality class."

This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup. This significant improvement of PK-means GA in execution speed makes it highly suitable for low-latency real-time wireless networks (6G)"

Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \\textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/irfantahir301/Physicsis_loss."

A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness.

MTBs bring together diverse experts in oncology, where diagnostic and prognostic tasks require integrating heterogeneous data and evolving insights over time.

We benchmark multiple open and closed-source LLMs and show that, even at scale, they lack reliability -- frequently hallucinating, struggling with reasoning from time-resolved data, and failing to reconcile conflicting evidence or different modalities. To address these limitations, MTBBench goes beyond benchmarking by providing an agentic framework with foundation model-based tools that enhance multi-modal and longitudinal reasoning, leading to task-level performance gains of up to 9.0% and 11.2%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Context. Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption lines can be used to probe the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. Cold HI with a significant optical depth from the GASKAP-HI survey is found to be located predominantly if not exclusively within filamentary structures that can be identified as caustics with the Hessian operator. Most of these HI filaments (57%) are also observable in the far-infrared (FIR) and trace the orientation of magnetic field lines. Aims. We considered whether molecular hydrogen (H2) might also be preferentially associated with CNM filaments. Methods. We analyzed 241 H2 absorption lines against stars and determined whether the lines of sight intersected HI or FIR filaments. Using Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) H2 data in the velocity range -50 < vLSR < 50 km/s, we traced 65 additional H2 lines for filamentary HI and FIR structures in velocity and probed the H2 absorption for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. For 305 out of 306 positions, the lines of sight with H2 absorption intersect HI filaments. In 120 cases, there is also evidence for a correlation with dusty FIR filaments. All of the 65 available sight lines with known velocities intersect HI filaments. In 64 cases, the H2 velocities are consistent with HI filament velocities. For FIR filaments, an agreement is found for only 13 out of 14 H2 absorption lines. Conclusions. For the majority of H2 absorption lines, there is evidence that H2 is associated with cold HI filaments. Evidence of an association with FIR filaments is less compelling. Confusion along the line of sight limits the detectability of FIR filaments. For a comparable degree of UV excitation in the disk and lower Galactic halo, the formation rate of H2 appears to be enhanced in HI filaments with increased CNM densities."

    "abstract": "Developing comprehensive assistive technologies requires the seamless integration of visual and auditory perception. This research evaluates the feasibility of a modular architecture inspired by core functionalities of perceptive systems like 'Smart Eye.' We propose and benchmark three independent sensing modules: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for eye state detection (drowsiness/attention), a deep CNN for facial expression recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for voice-based speaker identification. Utilizing the Eyes Image, FER2013, and customized audio datasets, our models achieved accuracies of 93.0%, 97.8%, and 96.89%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning and problem-solving.Recent works introduce multi-agent reflection frameworks where multiple LLM agents critique and refine each other's outputs using reinforcement learning (RL). However, these approaches often rely on single-shot responses and lack structural diversity in reasoning exploration. In this paper, we propose DRAFT-RL, a novel framework that integrates Chain-of-Draft (CoD) reasoning into multi-agent RL training. Instead of generating single responses, each agent produces multiple drafts per query, which are then evaluated by peer agents and a learned reward model to identify the most promising trajectory. These selected drafts are used to refine future reasoning strategies through actor-critic learning.DRAFT-RL enables explicit multi-path exploration, peer-guided reflection, and reward-aligned selection, resulting in more robust and interpretable LLM agent behavior. We evaluate our method on complex reasoning tasks including code synthesis, symbolic math, and knowledge-intensive QA,demonstrating that DRAFT-RL outperforms existing reflective and RL-based agents by significant margins in both accuracy and convergence speed"

    "abstract": "This paper presents pNav, a novel power-management system that significantly enhances the power/energy-efficiency of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by jointly optimizing their physical/mechanical and cyber subsystems. By profiling AMRs' power consumption, we identify three challenges in achieving CPS (cyber-physical system) power-efficiency that involve both cyber (C) and physical (P) subsystems: (1) variabilities of system power consumption breakdown, (2) environment-aware navigation locality, and (3) coordination of C and P subsystems. pNav takes a multi-faceted approach to achieve power-efficiency of AMRs. First, it integrates millisecond-level power consumption prediction for both C and P subsystems. Second, it includes novel real-time modeling and monitoring of spatial and temporal navigation localities for AMRs. Third, it supports dynamic coordination of AMR software (navigation, detection) and hardware (motors, DVFS driver) configurations. pNav is prototyped using the Robot Operating System (ROS) Navigation Stack, 2D LiDAR, and camera. Our in-depth evaluation with a real robot and Gazebo environments demonstrates a >96% accuracy in predicting power consumption and a 38.1% reduction in power consumption without compromising navigation accuracy and safety."

Here, we demonstrate a vehicle-mounted MIR DCS system based on optical-optical modulated frequency combs (OMFCs), which achieve passive mutual coherence between the two combs. The system enables point-by-point and drive-by measurements under various outdoor conditions, achieving minimum detection limits of 45 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH$_4$) and 46 parts per million (ppm) for water vapor (H$_2$O) at 100-s averaging time. Finally, we mapped the two-dimensional concentration field and the concentration probability distribution near a CH$_4$ source and compared them with the contemporaneous wind rose. These experiments demonstrate the system's capability for localized gas identification and in situ quantification with high temporal and spatial resolution."

We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the singularity of the Fisher information matrix for a bi-parametrized qubit state. By using controlled rotations of ancillary systems between successive interaction stages, we eliminate parameter interdependencies, thereby rendering the quantum Fisher information matrix non-singular. Remarkably, we demonstrate that precision enhancement in the joint estimation of multiple temperatures can be achieved even in the absence of correlations among the ancillas, surpassing the corresponding thermal Fisher information limits. Exploiting correlations within the ancillary system yields additional enhancement of Fisher information. Finally, we identify the dimensionality of the ancillary systems as a key factor governing the efficiency of multiparameter temperature estimation."

The Fermilab Booster BPM system has been used to measure these quadrupole moments in the past year and derive emittances from them.

To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks."

We construct a Hamiltonian that when applying the usual canonical formalism gives a closed algebra and equations of motion that result in the original metric obtained by using distorted Poisson brackets. The resulting theory is thus rendered canonical and covariant. We then covariantly couple scalar matter and dust to the modified gravity to allow the study of dynamics."

Their work uses neural networks and attribution techniques to guide human intuition towards making provable conjectures. Here, we build upon this framework to develop a method for identifying sufficient conditions that imply a given mathematical statement. Our approach trains neural networks with a custom loss function that prioritizes high precision. Then uses attribution techniques and exploratory data analysis to make conjectures. As a demonstration, we apply this process to Stanley's problem of $e$-positivity of graphs--a problem that has been at the center of algebraic combinatorics for the past three decades. Guided by AI, we rediscover that one sufficient condition for a graph to be $e$-positive is that it is co-triangle-free, and that the number of claws is the most important factor for $e$-positivity. Based on the most important factors in Saliency Map analysis of neural networks, we suggest that the classification of $e$-positive graphs is more related to continuous graph invariants rather than the discrete ones. Furthermore, using neural networks and exploratory data analysis, we show that the claw-free and claw-contractible-free graphs with $10$ and $11$ vertices are $e$-positive, resolving a conjecture by Dahlberg, Foley, and van Willigenburg."

Its performance depends to some extent on the topological structure that controls the interaction of particles. Compared with static topology, dynamic topology has stronger adaptability to different search stages and has attracted attention in the field. However, in previous studies on dynamic topology, most of them only focused on the generation and change of topology, while ignoring the real-time evaluation of topological performance, so the algorithm cannot be adaptively adjusted according to the search situation. This paper proposes Self-Evaluated Topology Particle Swarm Optimization (SET-PSO), which generates a new topology when the algorithm is stuck, then evaluates it in the current search situation, and decides whether to keep the new topology through the metropolis criterion. This method achieves adaptive adjustment of dynamic topology. In the experiment, SET-PSO and other algorithms are tested in 7 kinds of 30 dimension benchmark functions and SET-PSO achieves the highest accuracy and stability in comparison with other algorithms, making it a nice alternative for high-precision and non-real-time application scenarios such as industrial process optimization, engineering resource planning, and medical image analysis."

Here, we introduce a comprehensive analytical approach, combining a novel, highly accurate bonding energy measurement with multi-modal surface spectroscopy. This method reveals that degradation is governed by a dual-factor mechanism: the loss of interfacial water and the depletion of surface silanol groups. The direct correlation between these interfacial changes and the reduction in bonding energy was quantitatively confirmed by thermal desorption and sum-frequency generation spectroscopy. This study provides the first quantitative insight into the degradation kinetics during storage, offering a clear scientific basis for optimizing D2W hybrid bonding processes."

A transverse magnetic circuit model is established to investigate the influence of air-gap magnetic field distribution on thrust performance. In addition, a coupled model that incorporates eddy current loss, magnetic phase difference, and detent force is developed to analyze the interaction between the composite core materials and their electromagnetic characteristics. The analysis reveals that the detent force is highly dependent on the proportion of different core materials. By optimizing the composite mover structure, both thrust ripple and the peak-to-peak detent force can be significantly reduced. For a 9-slot/10-pole PMSLM, the thrust ripple decreases from 12.05% to 4.32% while maintaining the original thrust and volume. Furthermore, compared with traditional end auxiliary structures, the PMSLM with a composite mover core has advantages of higher power and thrust densities, as well as reduced normal electromagnetic force fluctuations."

To address these limitations, we propose TCDR–PD, a temporal and contextual dynamic representation network with pattern decomposition. TCDR–PD introduces a temporal and contextual dynamic representation learning (TCDR) module to capture both global temporal trends and query-specific contextual dynamics, enabling more precise embeddings. Additionally, the pattern decomposition (PD) prediction module explicitly disentangles the prediction of recurring and emerging patterns, enabling tailored strategies to improve reasoning performance. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TCDR–PD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively supporting stable reasoning over evolving TKGs."

However, existing vibration signal generation methods have problems such as time domain information loss, instability, and difficulty in maintaining the physical consistency of frequency components. In order to meet the challenge of generating high-quality vibration signals, this paper proposes a finite impulse response generative adversarial networks with frequency-domain loss constraints (FIR-FreqGAN), which introduces a frequency loss constraint based on physical information to improve the quality of the generated signal. At the same time, a physically meaningful finite impulse response convolution kernel is added to the discriminator for enhancement, thereby improving its ability to identify fault-sensitive features. Extensive experiments were conducted on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and a self-collected bearing fault dataset under various imbalance ratios, demonstrating that FIR-FreqGAN produces high-fidelity signals and significantly improves fault classification accuracy over conventional oversampling and state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. In addition, an autoencoder-based reconstruction experiment was performed on the MFPT dataset, which contains unlabeled real-world bearing signals. The results show that signals generated by FIR-FreqGAN achieve lower reconstruction loss than those generated by baseline models, further confirming its generalization ability and frequency-domain consistency under realistic conditions."

Validation on shale core samples from the Longmaxi Formation demonstrates that, compared with conventional thresholding, level-set methods, and existing deep learning approaches, the proposed approach significantly enhances the detection of fine fractures and the completeness of geometric reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency, confirming its robustness and effectiveness in fracture characterization."

Using a corpus of mHealth texts, the framework extracts hidden semantics through TF-IDF, topic modeling, and contextual mapping with domain ontologies. It then employs prompt-based interactions with large language models (LLMs) to systematically generate and validate hypotheses aligned with identified topic-concept relationships. The results demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in producing high-quality, structured hypotheses, as validated by expert ratings ranging from 4.2 to 4.6. Most hypotheses were found to be plausible or highly plausible, with low semantic redundancy indicating diversity across topics, except in stakeholder-related areas which showed moderate overlap. Although the inclusion of semantic augmentation increased processing time, it significantly enhanced interpretability and validity. The high lexical density observed (up to 0.90) further reflects the linguistic flexibility of the generated hypotheses. This approach underscores the potential of computational methods in automating hypothesis generation and enabling data-driven discoveries in the mHealth domain."

    "abstract": "The achievement of precise 3D object detection via LiDAR–camera fusion is of utmost importance for enabling autonomous driving in complex traffic environments. However, existing methods encounter two substantial challenges: spatial misalignment among heterogeneous sensor modalities and the loss of fine-grained geometric details during cross-modal feature fusion. To address these issues, we propose a frustum-aware fusion network with cross-attention. This network utilizes a unified point–voxel representation to integrate both image and point cloud data, thus improving the quality of multi-modal fusion for 3D object detection. Specifically, we present an innovative multi-modal alignment module (MAM) that achieves more accurate cross-modal feature alignment by integrating depth-aware geometric structures from point clouds with high-level semantic features extracted from images. Subsequently, a sliding frustum mechanism is employed to dynamically partition point clouds within target regions and extract their key features, thereby refining the representation of local geometry. Moreover, a region-aligned attention module (RAAM) is designed, which utilizes 2D detection boxes as queries to guide the refinement and focus of 3D features, facilitating adaptive fusion of multi-scale point–voxel representations. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. On the KITTI test set, our method achieves 3D mAPs of 90.88%, 84.47%, and 80.99% for the Car category under Easy, Moderate, and Hard settings, respectively. On the NuScenes benchmark, the proposed model attains APs of 89.2% and 64.9% for Pedestrian and Bicycle detection, respectively. Moreover, on theWaymo dataset, our framework achieves 3DmAPHscores of 82.07% (L1) and 76.38% (L2) across all object categories, demonstrating significant improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia refers to abnormal deviations in the normal heart rhythm, possibly signifying severe cardiovascular conditions. The manual identification of arrhythmias by ECG analysis is labor-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is susceptible to inter-observer variability. Conventional signal-based classification techniques depend significantly on manually produced features, which may exhibit insufficient resilience and generalizability across varied patient demographics and noisy datasets. These constraints underscore the pressing need for automated, scalable, and interpretable diagnostic methodologies. To rectify these deficiencies, we offer an innovative approach that converts the ECG signal into 2D waveform images, facilitating the use of advanced image-based deep learning algorithms. ECG recordings from MIT-BIH were segmented around beats and converted to waveform graphs using wfdb, matplotlib, and PIL. Each image, reduced to 224×224 pixels, graphically encapsulates about 0.7 seconds of ECG data, enabling deep neural networks to learn both temporal and morphological features. The preprocessing pipeline comprises amplitude normalization, noise filtration and augmentation to improve signal quality and model robustness. We introduce a hybrid deep learning model (ECG-CNNTX -Electrocardiogram Classification using CNN and Transformer with Explainability) that integrates EfficientNetB0 for effective and resilient feature extraction with a Transformer-based attention module to capture long-range relationships in image representations. Our model achieved a classification accuracy of 99% in identifying Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs). Grad-CAM visualization elucidates essential ECG areas that impact predictions, hence augmenting clinical dependability for model interpretability. This study introduces a dependable, precise, and interpretable ECG classification framework that integrates traditional signal processing with sophisticated AI-driven image analysis, providing an innovative and scalable method for arrhythmia diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning methods enforce label distance relationships in feature space to improve representation capability for regression models. However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods.

A prototypical example is the temperature blanket, which represents the weather through rows or blocks of different colors mapped to temperature ranges. While researchers have used fiber arts mediums to create exploratory projects, data visualization and physicalization research has largely not engaged with examples from this enormous and diverse community. We explore the space of data textiles, or fiber arts that encode information, by surveying creators (i.e., data fiber artists) on their projects and processes. We create a corpus of 159 examples of data textiles and present a schema characterizing the data encoding methods used in these projects. We also gather insights into creators' data workflows as well as their motives and discoveries through making with their data. Creators of data textiles use distinct processes to map their data, building fabric from component structures and substructures while using material properties like color and texture. From diverse data-tracking procedures, creators use and relate to data in varied ways. Working on these pieces also contributes to the creators' personal growth and data understanding. Our findings point to new opportunities for visualization, including opportunities to support fiber artists with tools formatted to their needs and opportunities to incorporate concepts from data textiles into other types of visualization (e.g., using texture, structural layouts, colorways)."

First, a prescribed-time output-constrained function is defined and a class of time-varying barrier Lyapunov functions is developed, including estimation error information for disturbances and system parameters. Then, based on these functions and Nussbaum-type functions, an adaptive prescribed-time tracking control scheme is proposed for the powered descent phase of Mars landing in the presence of time-varying output constraints, unmeasured input deadzone nonlinearity and unknown vehicle mass, such that the tracking error converges to zero in a prescribed time and the control signals are bounded.

The device implements a quasi-synchronous background detection scheme, effectively suppressing relative background drift to within 0.8%. It achieves a high spectral resolution of 0.004 cm⁻¹ and a rapid response time of 25 seconds per heterodyne spectrum. Field measurements were conducted in the Ali region of the Tibetan Plateau in August 2024. On August 14, the system continuously monitored the atmospheric H₂O absorption spectrum, and the retrieved column concentrations exhibited a relative uncertainty of 1.37%. Additional measurements on August 16 and August 21 yielded relative uncertainties of 1.16% and 2.79%, respectively, confirming the repeatability of the system. Comparison with simultaneous measurements from a Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker EM27/SUN) showed consistent temporal variability with a correlation coefficient of 0.77. These results demonstrate that the developed LHR combines fast acquisition speed, high spectral resolution, and reliable precision and repeatability, making it well suited for stable atmospheric water vapor monitoring."

    "abstract": "While systematic radiometric errors can be mitigated through on-orbit calibration, correcting low-frequency, time-varying errors often induced by complex imaging dynamics remains a greater challenge. This study introduces a correction method tailored for optical remote sensing platforms to overcome such errors in JiTian-03 imagery, particularly those arising from high-agility curve imaging. The process begins with relative radiometric calibration to correct high-frequency inconsistencies among sensor detectors, thereby suppressing striping and banding noise in the imagery. Next, the image is decomposed into low-frequency background and high-frequency detail components. A column-wise moment-matching algorithm is then applied to the low-frequency background, aligning each column’s first- and second-order central moments with global statistics to derive correction coefficients. This approach effectively compensates for low-frequency radiometric errors while preserving high-frequency texture details in the image. Experimental results confirm that, following correction of both high- and low-frequency radiometric errors, JT-03 imagery exhibits a substantial reduction in striping, banding, and brightness nonuniformity. The correction yields a uniform radiometric response across the entire field of view while preserving ground texture fidelity and image detail. As a result, the radiometric uniformity of JT-03 image products is significantly enhanced. Quantitatively, post high-frequency calibration, the striping index across all JT-03 bands improved to within 0.1% and the standard deviation of column means to 4.7%. Subsequent low-frequency correction reduced the standard deviation of column means by an average of 73.89%, achieving a final value of better than 1.3%."

The model is verified by TCAD simulation of FE/SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> interface potential.

The simulation results show that the FWV-NC-DG-FinFET with lager ferroelectric width at drain side results in severe gate-drain coupling effect and lead to ION/IOFF ratio over 107. In contrast, the FWV-NC-DG-FinFET with lager ferroelectric width at source side leads to slighter gate-drain coupling and is able to achieve SS of 51.9 mV/dec and reduce the increment of SS and threshold voltage with increased drain voltage. Meanwhile, the FWV-NC-DG-FinFET with lager ferroelectric width at source side can also mitigates the NDR effect. Furthermore, this paper presents a feasible method to fabricate such FWV-NC-DG-FinFET."

Furthermore, we fuse the text tokens extracted from a textual description with the image features extracted using each of those blocks through a Text Prompt Block (TPB), to enhance the semantics understanding ability of the network. A Cascade Feature Block (CFB) is also designed for each stage of the encoder, to combine the feature maps, the logit maps decoded from them and the input image. This block incorporates the prior and original characteristics into the image representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our TPCM-SegNet achieves the superior, or at least comparable, performance to baselines, across eight publicly available datasets.

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering has been empirically shown to improve learning performance by leveraging the inherent complementary information across multiple views of data. However, in real-world scenarios, collecting strictly aligned views is challenging, and learning from both aligned and unaligned data becomes a more practical solution. Partially View-aligned Clustering (PVC) aims to learn correspondences between misaligned view samples to better exploit the potential consistency and complementarity across views, including both aligned and unaligned data. However, most existing PVC methods fail to leverage unaligned data to capture the shared semantics among samples from the same cluster. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of multi-view data induces distributional shifts in representations, leading to inaccuracies in establishing meaningful correspondences between cross-view latent features and, consequently, impairing learning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic MAtching contRasTive learning model (SMART) for PVC. The main idea of our approach is to alleviate the influence of cross-view distributional shifts, thereby facilitating semantic matching contrastive learning to fully exploit semantic relationships in both aligned and unaligned data. Specifically, we mitigate view distribution shifts by aligning cross-view covariance matrices, which enables the inference of a semantic graph for all data. Guided by the learned semantic graph, we further exploit semantic consistency across views through semantic matching contrastive learning. After the optimization of the above mechanisms, our model smoothly performs semantic matching for different view embeddings instead of the cumbersome view realignment, which enables the learned representations to enjoy richer category-level semantics and stronger robustness. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches on the PVC problem.

The considered MEC architecture integrates unmanned surface vessels (USVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and a ship platform with high-performance edge servers. USVs generate sensing and computing tasks that can be (i) executed locally, (ii) offloaded to UAVs for aerial edge processing, or (iii) relayed through UAVs to the ship under line-of-sight (LoS) links. The system model jointly captures queueing dynamics, wireless transmission latency, computation delay, and battery constraints. The hybrid offloading problem is formulated as a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where each USV acts as an agent that decides its offloading mode under partial observations. To solve this, MARHO employs a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) scheme, enabling agents to learn resource-aware strategies that effectively balance communication and computation. A Gym-based simulation environment is developed, integrating realistic maritime signal propagation, queue dynamics, and mixed offloading scenarios. The experimental results under different task loads demonstrate that MARHO consistently achieves higher throughput and has a lower average latency compared to the existing benchmark."

To solve the model that includes internal and external optimization, the path length error iterative compensation method is used to fast design the shaped subreflector. And for the external optimization, a dichotomy, taking into account the monotonic relationship between reflectors error and antennas gain, is designed to iteratively obtain the relaxed error items upper, lower bounds and the convergent results. The 110 meters standard and 80 meters offset reflector antennas working at 115 GHz and 30 GHz respectively with two classic deformation error types are taken as the examples. The excellent results obtained by a few iterations shown the effectiveness of the proposed model and the corresponding fast solution method, and both of the two type errors are relaxed by over tens and even hundreds of times, indicating the enormous potential of shaped subreflector for compensating the main reflector deformation."

However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions."

However, this approach often fails to capture the complexities of real-world usage when the user is actively engaging with the controller. This study, therefore, aimed to develop an alternative training protocol that promotes more robust pattern recognition-based myoelectric control. In an experiment with 20 participants, we compared three training methods: conventional screen-guided training without feedback, real-time visual feedback of principal component analysis (PCA)-based projections of EMG activity, and real-time classification feedback with intentionally corrupted classifier outputs. After training, participants completed a Fitts’ law-style target acquisition task in a virtual environment, repeating it at three different difficulty levels. We then evaluated how offline accuracy and metrics, particularly Bhattacharyya Distances computed from combinations of the PCA projections, correlated with online control performance. Our findings indicate that training with feedback yielded the best performance, with PCA-based visual feedback providing the most effective calibration environment. Additionally, projecting the EMG data collected with PCA-based feedback into the PCA space derived from the no-feedback data improved the correlation between offline separability metrics and the online Fitts’ Law throughput. Interestingly, this correlation was stronger for the easy difficulty level. Nevertheless, the benefits of PCA-based feedback were consistent across the three different difficulty levels of the Fitts’ law task, it as a beneficial and robust approach worthy of further exploration."

To overcome this challenge, we first propose the online censoring (OC)-based gCKLMS (OC-gCKLMS), which integrates the OC strategy into the gCKLMS framework. The OC selectively retains informative input data and its corresponding kernel and pseudo-kernel coefficients by exploiting data redundancy and then incorporates them into the update process. This significantly reduces computational burden without compromising performance. Then, we theoretically analyze the mean square convergence of the OC-gCKLMS. Finally, the elegant properties of the OC-gCKLMS are validated through simulations on three benchmark problems."

In this paper, we present a new simulation approach that executes the actual code designed for embedded Linux devices, thereby ensuring high fidelity. Our method intercepts system calls of real programs and integrates them with a parallel discrete-event simulator for improved efficiency. Preliminary results show that our approach achieves up to 4.8× speedup over abstraction-based simulators for the example ALOHA protocol with 841 nodes."

    "abstract": "Queue management policies strongly influence latency, loss, and fairness, yet production switches often rely on static configurations. Changing policies in the wild is risky, as experiments can disrupt SLAs and queue dynamics are hard to reproduce offline. We present QueuePilot, a digital twin for switch queues that enables safe, traffic-driven evaluation of scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) policies. Our prototype, built on two Tofino switches, clones live traffic into the twin, multiplexes it across multiple queueing strategies, and monitors real-time fine-grained metrics. Preliminary results show that QueuePilot can synchronize with the production queues and simultaneously evaluate alternative queuing policies, allowing precise real-time queue management without affecting live traffic."

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods represented by deep learning have achieved remarkable results in multi-temporal remote sensing image interpretation. Most current methods adopt the concept of transfer learning, using pre-trained weights trained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet to initialize the backbone of downstream tasks. However, the multi-temporal differences between natural scenes and remote sensing images limit the generalization of these methods in remote sensing tasks. Selfsupervised learning can leverage large-scale unlabeled remote sensing data for pre-training to provide more adaptable features for downstream tasks, but the high computational cost restricts its applicability to remote sensing tasks. This paper proposes a self-supervised pre-training method for multi-temporal remote sensing imagery by joint embedding learning named MT-JEL. By introducing multi-temporal remote sensing information as additional seasonal augmentation, the method enhances the model’s ability to represent multi-temporal land cover features. Meanwhile, a large number of diverse image patches obtained through standard augmentation of multi-temporal images are used to facilitate the joint embedding learning in the representation space. Experimental results demonstrate that MT-JEL not only significantly improves pre-training efficiency but also ensures optimal accuracy when transferred to downstream tasks."

    "abstract": "Soft errors, typically caused by cosmic rays and particle strikes, have become a reliability challenge of modern electronics in aerospace, automotive, and high-performance computing. In advanced nodes with billions of transistors, a single strike can propagate errors, disrupting critical operations. As a result, traditional methods for estimating Soft Error Rate (SER), such as TCAD simulations and arithmetic formulas, are accurate but have become computationally expensive. In order to alleviate the computational burden, we propose a Model Order Reduction (MOR) approach to analyze charge collection dynamics induced by ionizing particles. More specifically, we start from the physics-based model of the diffusion-collection mechanism, then we discretize the fundamental equations in the 3D space, and formulate the system as a high-dimensional state-space problem. Finally, by applying the Extended Krylov Subspace (EKS) combined with Moment Matching (MM) techniques, we reduce computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant computational speedups while maintaining the accuracy of the full model."

The method for optimal selection of satellites and BiSAR configuration optimization based on LEO constellations is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the selection of satellites and the configuration design of BiSAR are modeled as a Multiobjective Optimization Problem (MOP), where the minimal resolution cell and the maximum imaging area are used as the optimal criteria. Secondly, the improved third generation Nondomi-nated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) is applied to solve the MOP, with satellite numbers introduced as discrete decision variables. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results."

The destruction of infrastructure and the occupation of territories have caused a significant reduction in agricultural production, affecting food security in the region and the world. Land use changes were analyzed based on the analysis of the time series of satellite data for 2016-2024. Using the developed reference mask of cropland, the area of abandoned land increased to 17.4% (5.1 million hectares) of the total area (29.1 million hectares) detected. In the occupied territories, 46.3% of agricultural land (2.7 million hectares out of 5.9 million hectares) was not cultivated in 2024. An analysis of historically irrigated lands in the Kherson region revealed changes in the crop structure, with the largest reduction in moisture-dependent crops: soybean areas decreased by 95.8%, and maize by 52.3%.

Some researchers have also introduced Transformer into image fusion networks to capture global long-range dependencies. However, there is a lack of research on global dependencies for different local features. Therefore, this paper proposes an infrared and visible image fusion strategy that integrates global multi-scale information. The proposed method extracts local features using multi-scale modules, then integrates them using a Transformer-based global feature extraction module. Finally, an attention map is generated based on the extracted features to preserve salient information and perform fusion. In the experimental section, the proposed algorithm is tested and compared on the MSRS and TNO datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and advancement of the fusion performance."

Sidewalk extraction is one of the important topics in modern urban planning and management. Existing methods for sidewalk extraction based on satellite images face challenges such as occlusion by trees and buildings. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-view sidewalk extraction method that integrates satellite and street-view images. To achieve this integration, our method establishes two parallel branches to simultaneously process the cross-view inputs. Additionally, to address the significant discrepancy between satellite and street-view images, we introduce the Bird’s Eye View (BEV) transformation in the street-view branch. By converting street-view images into satellite-view BEV images, we extract perspective-aligned features, thereby solving the sidewalk occlusion problem in single remote sensing images through cross-view feature fusion. Furthermore, we introduce two new cross-view datasets for sidewalks extraction, sampling from cities of New York and Seattle, and evaluate several advanced semantic segmentation methods on these datasets. Our method achieves the best performance on both datasets with IoU values of 62.56% and 57.51%. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improving sidewalk extraction performance in challenging scenarios such as tree occlusions and building shadows."

This study investigates the potential of super-resolution to perform road segmentation at 62.5 cm resolution from single-image Sentinel-2 RGB data, bridging the resolution domain gap. Both the super-resolution and the segmentation models are trained on high-resolution data, making the task more difficult. We demonstrate that these models can generalize to low-resolution data and deliver usable results for various applications, particularly in regions lacking up-to-date high-resolution imagery."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection presents unique challenges due to noise, clutter, and the need for both local and global feature extraction. Traditional single-branch detectors, whether purely CNN or Transformer based, often encounter feature competition, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch network comprising a CNN branch (e.g., ConvNeXt) and a Transformer branch (e.g., Swin Transformer) to tackle these issues. By separating local and global feature extraction, we harness the inherent strengths of each architecture and mitigate feature competition. A frequency-guided attention module (FGMA) then aggregates their complementary representations, leading to more accurate and robust detection outcomes. Experimental results on multiple benchmark SAR datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms single-branch baselines in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., mean Average Precision) and qualitative visual analysis. This framework, leveraging prior knowledge of CNNs and Transformers, provides a promising direction for advancing SAR object detection."

This may hinder the model performance on downstream tasks when adopting SFT on small-scale annotated SAR data. In this paper, an self-supervised learning (SSL) method of masked image modeling based on Masked Auto-Encoders (MAE) is proposed to learn feature representations of SAR images during the pre-training process and benefit the object detection task in SAR images of SFT. The evaluation experiments on the large-scale SAR object detection benchmark named SARDet-100k verify that the proposed method captures proper latent representations of SAR images and improves the model generalization in downstream tasks by converting the pre-trained domain from natural scenes to SAR images through SSL. The proposed method achieves an improvement of 1.3 mAP on the SARDet-100k benchmark compared to only the SFT strategies."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method to limit overvoltage stress on full-bridge submodules (FB-SMs) in Hybrid Modular Multilevel Converters (H-MMCs) when a DC short-circuit fault happens. The H-MMCs will employ a reduced number of FBSMs per arm to minimize conduction losses during normal operation, while being coordinated with hybrid circuit breakers (H-CBs) to enable fast fault isolation in multi-terminal DC (MTDC) systems. After confirming a DC fault, the CB initiates the opening of the mechanical switch, and the H-MMC is blocked to prevent the discharge of MMC submodules, thereby limiting the current rise in the MMC and CB components. However, due to the blocking of the H-MMC, the FB-SMs in certain upper and lower arms may experience significant overvoltage stress. To mitigate this stress, two measures are implemented: (1) the voltage across the contacts of the mechanical switch in the H-CB is gradually increased during its opening process, and (2) the FB-SMs in the arm experiencing higher overvoltage stress are bypassed once a critical threshold is reached. These steps alleviate the stress on the FB-SMs without requiring an increase in their capacitance or the addition of auxiliary circuits in the H-MMC. The validity of this approach is verified through simulation results obtained in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in HVDC systems."

However, the material and structural characteristics of SiC devices introduce more severe reliability issues, necessitating the optimization of packaging parameters to extend their operational lifespan. Currently, the packaging failures of SiC modules have not been well studied in the past. Since the solder layer is one of the primary failure sites in SiC modules, this study investigates the impact of solder layer thickness on module reliability. A combination of finite element simulation and power cycling tests is employed, and the solder layer is scanned using a 3D X-ray imager. The results indicate that as the solder layer thickness increases from 0.10 mm, the thermal stress experienced by the module first decreases and then increases, with the highest reliability observed at a thickness of approximately 0.20 mm. This study enhances the understanding of the relationship between thermal stress, solder layer voids, and lifespan, providing a foundation for investigating failure mechanisms. By employing thermal stress analysis and porosity statistics, it reflects the failure process and aids in developing more precise lifespan models. The findings also offer guidance for optimizing solder layer parameters during module design to minimize thermal stress, thereby improving lifespan and achieving high-reliability module design."

To meet the voltage withstand requirements of pulsed power switches, ranging from tens to hundreds kV, dozens of low-voltage SiC MOSFETS must be connected in series. However, factors such as loop impedance, gate drive delay, the count of switches connected in series, and duty cycle affect the voltage balancing capability of the topology, thereby influencing the voltage withstand limit and safe operation of each switch.

The contribution to these losses from the output capacitances of SiC MOSFETs and from the parasitic capacitances introduced by power module packaging are analyzed. We differentiate between the energy stored in the output capacitance, and subsequently lost during discharging, and the losses incurred during the charging of output capacitance via the opposite switch, which are often overlooked in datasheets. We also investigate the additional losses coming from capacitances of power module packaging. Two experimental methods are introduced to determine zero-current switching losses and results indicate that the energy stored in output capacitance accounts for only a fraction of the total zero-current switching losses. Results also show the significant effect of package capacitances on zero-current switching losses.

    "abstract": "The hybrid synchronization control (HSC) method and active susceptance controller (ASC) have been demonstrated to be effective approaches for addressing the instability of grid-forming inverters under strong grid conditions. In this paper, HSC and ASC are demonstrated to share the same essence—introducing a voltage-based synchronization loop. Furthermore, differing from previous studies that rely on small-signal analysis, this paper establishes a unified large-signal model for both HSC and ASC to characterize the inertia and damping, and to elaborate that how they affect the dynamic responses. Based on the large-signal model, it is revealed that the introduced voltage-based synchronization loop of both HSC and ASC reduces the damping and inertia, thereby resulting in a faster response and higher overshoot. The findings are confirmed by the experimental results."

    "abstract": "Time synchronization and phase synchronization are critical for bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BiSAR), as synchronization accuracy is closely related to both imaging quality and interferometric precision. However, clocks with lower stability require higher synchronization frequencies to achieve the desired synchronization accuracy, which presents a significant challenge for BiSAR systems. To overcome this issue, a high-precision phase synchronization algorithm assisted by synchronization compensation time is proposed. The method utilizes two-way time transfer (TWTT) to acquire the synchronization compensation time, from which the bistatic frequency deviation is estimated. With the assistance of the estimated frequency deviation, the synchronization phase can be correctly unwrapped under low synchronization frequency, allowing for interpolation and phase compensation. The proposed algorithm has been validated through laboratory tests and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne flight experiments, achieving phase synchronization accuracy of better than 1° in the X-band under a synchronization frequency of 250 Hz, using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) oscillators."

Rapid and accurate damage assessment is essential for effective rescue efforts and resource allocation. This study employs the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to develop a flood impact assessment model, focusing on the major flood event around Poyang Lake in July 2020. The model provides a comprehensive flood assessment solution, evaluating both environmental and socio-economic impacts. By integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, it enhances flood extent extraction accuracy and assesses environmental impacts through the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) before and after the flood. The results indicate a flooded area of 204,063 hectares and an impact area of 302,633 hectares. The average RSEI index decreased from 0.71 to 0.65, reflecting negative environmental effects. The total number of individuals affected was approximately 1.77 million, with 122,880 hectares of cropland and 15,670 hectares of urban areas being impacted. These findings are consistent with the damage reports at the provincial level, thereby confirming the reliability of the model. This research provides an efficient method for flood information extraction and analysis, supporting flood risk management and sustainable regional development."

As key nodes of road networks, intersections are vital for road network updates and traffic modeling, making their accurate detection essential. In optical remote sensing images, road intersections are often affected by occlusion and small, dense targets, leading to lower detection accuracy. To address this problem, an intersection detection method based on road network extraction from optical remote sensing images is proposed. The method first utilizes a deep learning model to extract the road network, followed by morphological operations for denoising and gap repair. Next, skeletonization extracts the road centerlines. Finally, intersection detection and shape segmentation are performed using an improved Harris corner detection algorithm. Experimental results on the DeepGlobe and Massachusetts datasets show F1-scores of 0.957 and 0.935, respectively, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness."

Current researches mainly focus on the cloud removal method itself, and usually improve cloud removal method performance by optimizing network structures or increasing model parameters. However, these methods are often accompanied by higher demands for computational resources and sample sizes. The impact of data accuracy on a method's ability to distinguish geomorphological changes, such as the influence of the radiometric resolution of optical images on cloud removal, has received insufficient attention. In this paper, taking the public dataset SEN12MS-CR as an example, the classic U-Net and Former-CR cloud removal methods are used as experimental verification methods to evaluate the impact of radiation resolution on SAR assisted optical remote sensing image cloud removal. Experimental results show that improving radiometric resolution significantly enhances the quality of cloud-removal images and compensates for the shortcomings of the cloud removal methods themselves, which is of great significance for practical applications."

The annotation of sonar data is time-consuming and costly, and the scarcity of labeled data makes it particularly important to develop semi-supervised learning methods that can effectively leverage unlabeled data. To address the high variability of seabed sediment features and spatial distribution differences, this study proposes a semi-supervised seabed sediment classification framework based on multi-level contrastive learning and uncertainty measurement (MCUF). 1) Optimization based on multi-level contrastive learning addresses the variability of seabed sediment features. It extracts and aggregates multi-level features to capture more comprehensive seabed sediment characteristics. By embedding sediment samples into the feature space through contrastive learning, the features of unlabeled data are aligned with those of labeled data, thereby improving the separability between sediment categories and the consistency within each category. 2) Pseudo-label filtering based on uncertainty measurement addresses the significant spatial distribution differences of seabed sediments. Dynamic computation of pseudo-label class weights is utilized to mitigate the bias caused by class imbalance. By calculating entropy to measure the uncertainty of model predictions, the threshold for pseudo-label selection is adaptively adjusted for sediment samples, enhancing the flexibility of filtering and discarding unreliable pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance improvements under various labeled data ratios. The proposed framework effectively leverages unlabeled data and significantly improves the accuracy of seabed sediment classification."

The approach is based on customized algorithms adapted to process surface reflectance data, taking into account atmospheric effects. These methods have proven effective in identifying, mapping, and tracking the spatial extent and movement of wastewater, thereby offering a more accurate evaluation of its environmental impact.Such an approach is essential for assessing ecological risks and guiding sustainable water management, particularly in urban regions where WWTPs are critical infrastructure for safeguarding public health and achieving environmental sustainability aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

However, the interferograms are susceptible to tropospheric delay artifacts, including both turbulent delays and stratified ones, especially in mountainous regions, due to temporal and spatial variation of temperature, humidity and pressure in the troposphere. Most atmospheric correction methods only address one of the delays and lack comprehensive consideration, thus it is hard to suppress the atmospheric artifacts completely. In this paper, we proposed a joint spatio-temporal correction (JSTC) method for both turbulent and stratified delays, which applies a dual-scale temporal low-pass filter to separate turbulent delays from other low-frequency components in temporal domain, then adopts the quadtree segmentation to correct stratified delays caused by spatial heterogeneity. The proposed method was first validated by simulated data, and then tested by real data in the mountainous region. The results demonstrated that our method can significantly reduce the impact of atmospheric artifacts on the interferograms."

To efficiently support typical SC computations in memristor arrays, we develop two types of circuit models: single-stage and multi-stage computational models. Single-stage model performs operations in a memristor array for basic SC operations, while multi-stage model performs operations in multi-cascaded memristor arrays for complex SC operation.

Traditional PCSs rely on low frequency transformers (LFTs) to integrate the ESS into the medium- or high-voltage power grid. However, LFTs are exceptionally bulky, noisy, costly, and highly space-consuming. Consequently, the transformerless PCS architecture stands out as a promising solution for reducing the cost and volume of ESSs. Currently, research on transformerless PCSs mostly focus on the low- or medium-voltage levels, there is hardly research involving high-voltage hundred-megawatt level ESSs thus far. Therefore, this paper investigates four topologies for high-voltage hundredmegawatt ESSs and analyzes their costs, efficiencies and volume. Ultimately, a comparatively cost-effective and efficient solution with promising performance is identified, offering guidelines for engineering practices and paving the way towards high-voltage hundred-megawatt-level ESSs. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed topology can operate under the grid-forming control, enhancing the stability and reliability of the power system as a grid-forming converter."

These values are a combination of the properties of different cavity systems that will be used in the FAIR synchrotron SIS100 in order to cover all requirements. The particle ion beam reaches peak currents of up to 100 A to 150 A with a pulse duration of 50 ns. Due to interference of the ion beam with the cavity, the impedance of the cavity has to be reduced temporarily, resulting in the requirement for a solid state switch consisting of semiconductors that are either turned off or turned on. Due to the harsh environement such as radiation, high temperature, high frequency and high voltages, the research questions guiding this inquiry are designed to explore the utilization of SiC MOSFETs, comprising up to 20 stages in total. An equivalent circuit of the used cavity and the gap switch is presented."

Focused on rice yield prediction in West Bengal, India, where rice is the country’s primary staple crop, this study utilizes deep learning models alongside datasets comprising meteorological variables and district-level production data. Preprocessing steps like spatial clipping, temporal smoothing, and scaling captured the relationship between environmental factors and rice cultivation. Transfer learning from the M4 dataset fine-tuned the models, and comparisons with traditional models like LSTM and GRU highlighted the ability of advanced architectures.

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides statistically valid uncertainty estimates and is increasingly recognized as a robust tool for uncertainty quantification. This paper investigates the performance of the two major approaches in CP, namely Inductive CP and k-fold Cross-Validation CP (CV+), in the context of flood segmentation. By evaluating these methods on a baseline bitemporal U-Net model, we demonstrate that CP can offer critical insights into model confidence. Our findings highlight the limitations of Inductive CP in data-scarce scenarios and underscore the advantages of CV+ in achieving a superior balance between calibration and training data usage.

The first of these missions, the NASA TROPICS (Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats) Earth Venture (EVI-3) mission, was successfully launched into orbit on May 7 and May 25, 2023 (Eastern Daylight Time, two CubeSats in each of the two launches). TROPICS is now providing nearly all-weather observations of 3-D temperature and humidity, as well as cloud ice and precipitation horizontal structure, at high temporal resolution to conduct high-value science investigations of tropical cyclones. TROPICS is providing rapid-refresh microwave measurements (median refresh rate of better than 60 minutes early in the mission with four functional CubeSats, and now approximately 70-90 minutes with three functional CubeSats) over the tropics that can be used to observe the thermodynamics of the troposphere and precipitation structure for storm systems at the mesoscale and synoptic scale over the entire storm lifecycle. Hundreds of high-resolution images of tropical cyclones have been captured thus far by the TROPICS mission, revealing detailed structure of the eyewall and surrounding rain bands. The new 205-GHz channel in particular (together with a traditional channel near 92 GHz) is providing new information on the inner storm structure, and, coupled with the relatively frequent revisit and low downlink latency, is already informing tropical cyclone analysis at operational centers. Here we present an an update on the TROPICS mission after over two years of science operations with a focus on the suite of geophysical (Level 2) products (atmospheric vertical temperature and moisture profiles, instantaneous surface rain rate, and tropical cyclone intensity). All TROPICS standard data products meet the mission baseline requirements."

The analysis reveals that excessive random keyframes in the later stages of motion can detrimentally impact pose estimation accuracy and environment reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of selected random keyframes. This strategy leverages more random keyframes during the early stages to reduce cumulative errors while reducing the number in the later stages to avoid incorrect pose influence. Experimental evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances pose tracking accuracy and reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "High-resolution satellite imagery, Landsat-based, well-documented deforestation data products and two field visits indicate that deforestation in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo is caused mostly by the conversion of forested park land to agricultural fields and some mining. Deforestation is worsening steadily (1.40 to 5.58 percent from 2013 to 2023) and is especially acute in the highland part of the park which is home to Grauer’s gorillas. This highland area is situated mostly above low-value volcanic rocks that are less attractive to miners and therefore less contentious in terms of conservation. This study supports early studies that indicated small mines are relatively common in the large lower western mineral-rich part of the park but cover small areas. Importantly, farming and some mining have effectively severed the forest corridor between the upper and lower parts of the park. This study suggests that western aid agencies and conservation organizations accept these unpleasant realities and allow the Congolese park rangers to focus their limited resources on conservation of the original mountainous upper part of the park with its well-known gorillas above low-value volcanic rocks before it is too late to save them. It is time for unpopular triage."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) has been extensively studied in the context of Earth observation. However, its application in Mars exploration remains limited. Specifically, the Martian environment is highly complex and may contain previously unseen mineral categories. The traditional trained HSIC models can only make predictions on pre-defined classes, which limits its application. Class incremental learning (CIL) addresses this issue by updating the model with new classes and incrementally incorporating new knowledge. However, the challenge becomes more pronounced when there are insufficient instances of new classes. Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is proposed to tackle the challenge. Although making the updated model similar to the old one is efficient for FSCIL, it is crucial to consider how to incorporate future new classes into the current model seamlessly. Based on this, we propose few-shot class incremental learning with precognition and retrospection for Mars HSIC (FSCILPR). In the framework, we first assign virtual prototypes and samples in the embedding space and introduce a space reservation loss in the base session. Then, we propose a knowledge aggregation module to fuse the logits from base and novel branches adaptively, which preserves base class knowledge when accommodating novel concepts. Extensive experiments and analyses on the Mars datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, managing harmonic distortions caused by nonlinear loads remains a critical challenge in weak grids. This paper presents a novel grid-forming active power filter (GFM-APF) that integrates voltage and frequency regulation with effective harmonic control. The proposed control method generates harmonic voltage commands by detecting voltage at the point of common coupling. The GFM-APF compensates harmonic voltages by creating a near short-circuit impedance path for harmonics, thereby preventing harmonic currents from propagating into the grid. In addition to improving harmonic performances, the system enhances grid stability by enhancing inertia, damping, and short-circuit capacity while suppressing wide-frequency oscillations. The proposed method avoids complex parameter tuning, ensuring simplicity and scalability. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the GFM-APF in delivering precise harmonic control, improved power quality, and enhanced grid-forming capabilities."

    "abstract": "The Beas Basin is one of the major basins of the Indus River system in the northwestern Himalayas and is sustenance for millions. It is crucial in supporting regional water resources, agriculture, and biodiversity. However, this vital hydrological and ecological hotspot faces increasing challenges from the changing climate. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of precipitation patterns by integrating high-resolution gridded datasets of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Government of India and a remote sensing dataset. The monthly and seasonal climatology analysis reveals crucial insights into precipitation variability and its spatiotemporal distribution across the basin. Advanced trend analysis techniques reveal significant long-term shifts in rainfall patterns, underscoring the growing influence of climate change on this fragile Himalayan ecosystem. Dharamshala recorded the highest long-term average rainfall (1948.90 mm), with extreme anomalies exceeding +1000 mm in the late 1980s and dipping below -750 mm in the early 2000s. Bhuntar, Manali, and Sunder-Nagar experienced significant dry periods with anomalies below -500 mm, while the late 1980s saw widespread above-average rainfall, peaking at +800 mm in Manali. In conjunction with ground-based observations, the remote sensing data enhances the spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis, offering a more comprehensive view of precipitation patterns in areas with limited ground data. Additionally, a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was utilized to analyze precipitation changes with elevation, helping to better understand orographic influences on rainfall distribution. These findings highlight the pressing need for adaptive strategies to address challenges in water resource management and disaster mitigation. This research lays the foundation for sustainable development and resilience in the most climate-sensitive regions by enriching our understanding of Himalayan monsoon dynamics."

M-WECS is then applied on the Reunion Island, with the two polarimetric channels VV and VH and their ratio. We use a post-classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the resulting maps, according to a ground truth obtained with optical images on a set of 5 classes.

This paper proposes a method for extracting tree DBH based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based point cloud data. This method is characterized by its simplicity, speed, and accuracy, enabling the rapid extraction of tree DBH in a given scene. The point cloud data are acquired through the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. To mitigate the influence of outliers within the DBH range of the trunk, statistical filtering is employed to preprocess the point cloud data and eliminate outliers. To address the impact of ground points on DBH data extraction, the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is utilized for ground fitting. To alleviate the effect of missing point cloud data at the DBH due to canopy obstruction, point cloud data at a height of 1.2 - 1.4 meters above the ground are extracted as the DBH range and projected onto a two-dimensional plane. Subsequently, clustering is performed to fit circles for each category, thereby determining the DBH. When applied to UAV-based point cloud data, this method yields promising results."

    "abstract": "Accurate subsurface geological models are crucial for a productive mining industry. However, despite mapping efforts, lithological uncertainties still impact mineral processing. The advancement of drone-based remote sensing technologies has enabled the mapping of specific areas at a reduced cost. This study aimed to perform subsurface tomography using a drone-mounted radar system equipped with a P-band antenna. A case study has been performed on an iron ore mine in Brazil. The tomography was used to discriminate waste rock from iron ore. The material permittivity values were included in SAR processing to increase the tomography accuracy. Results showed a reflectivity intensity and depth correlation aligned with the expected distribution of ore bodies, correlating higher reflectivity regions with waste rock. Furthermore, a direct relationship between reflectivity and chemical content is revealed. These findings highlight the potential of the P-band radar system to improve the quality and detail of subsurface models, specifically to discriminate waste rock from iron ore. This approach can significantly help companies enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs."

We use our high-efficiency TD computing cell as the platform for this analysis. Simulations indicate that FeFET-based implementations achieve operating frequencies exceeding 30 MHz while occupying only 33% of the area of an equivalent memristor-based circuit, though with higher energy consumption. The three-terminal nature of the FeFET also offers performance advantages that two-terminal memristor-based implementations can only replicate through more complex cell architectures. These performance benefits, along with their compatibility with existing CMOS processes, position FeFETs as a strong candidate for neuromorphic TD computing applications."

To address this, we present a vision-language framework named Spectral-LLaVA, which integrates multispectral data with vision-language alignment techniques to enhance scene representation and description. Using the BigEarthNet-v2 dataset from Sentinel-2, we establish a baseline with RGB-based scene descriptions and further demonstrate substantial improvements through the incorporation of multispectral information. Our framework optimizes a lightweight linear projection layer for alignment while keeping the vision backbone of SpectralGPT frozen. Our experiments encompass (1) scene classification using linear probing, and (2) language modeling for jointly performing scene classification and description generation. Our results highlight Spectral-LLaVA’s ability to produce detailed and accurate descriptions, particularly for scenarios where RGB data alone proves inadequate, while also enhancing classification performance by refining SpectralGPT features into semantically meaningful representations. The code and dataset for this project are available here."

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a recognized methodology to determine the environmental impacts (EI) of a product, enabling to target their reduction through eco-design. However, when carrying out LCA, PE designers must contend with the complexity and time-intensive nature of data collection (Life Cycle Inventory or LCI), the lack of reliable aggregated LCA data representative of their systems, and the challenge of translating LCA results into actionable decisions. This article will showcase current LCA databases shortcomings in supporting eco-design initiatives in PE, focusing on inductors - significant contributors to the EI of PE systems. These claims will be supported by an experimental analysis of commercially available inductors. These findings will highlight the need for a parametric Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) model for Inductors, to estimate their unknown material breakdown from known electrical parameters, enabling more meaningful LCA for eco-design."

    "abstract": "The consistent approach for calibration of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) is always the main issue to validate the observations which are obtained from different scanners. One of the important criteria to consider in designing the calibration network for TLS is the precise estimation of the parameters which rely on less correlated or decorrelated parameters. Enhancing both criteria – precision and correlation - lead to the highly accurate observations (e.g., 3D point cloud). From the practical perspective, having high quality measurements assists in better distinction between geometric movement of objects and the uncertainty of TLS observations, especially for investigation of structural health in monitoring tasks. In this work, the developed stepwise algorithm for TLS self-calibration method was proposed with the core emphasis on minimum correlation and maximum precision of the quantities (i.e., parameters including exterior orientation parameters, calibration parameters (entire 18 parameters) and object points of the bundle block adjustment). The novel consideration of the work resulted in the least uncertainty for the observations and, importantly, consistent standardizations for TLS geometric error models. Additionally, compared to the former investigations, the advised error modellings were verified on various manufactured TLS systems - Leica ScanStation P50, Maptek I-sites 8820 (an Australian product) and Leica RTC360 – taking into account the highly redundant observations throughout the data collection steps."

While aligned with national decarbonization goals, this trend introduces technical challenges, particularly increased power losses, raising concerns for PT PLN (Persero) as the national electricity provider. To address these issues, this study evaluates $\\mathbf{P V}$ placement strategies to mitigate the impact of $\\mathbf{E V}$ charging station penetration, which introduces significant loads to distribution networks. A 20 kV urban feeder in Makassar is modeled using real field data, and various PV configurations are assessed through load flow simulations to examine their impact on network performance. The results show that certain configurations provide better performance in terms of power loss reduction while maintaining acceptable voltage profiles. The most feasible scenario achieves a $\\mathbf{2 2. 5 \\%}$ loss reduction. In some cases, adding more PV leads to infeasibility due to reverse power flow at weak load buses. These findings highlight that proper PV placement is more critical than simply increasing capacity. This research underscores the importance of strategic PV planning and offers practical insights for utilities in integrating renewable energy and EVCS expansion into urban power networks."

To overcome this problem, this research presents a fine-tuning-based zero-shot pansharpening with a residual double attention network (RDAN) to improve the spatial resolution of a single scene of the testing image. In the experiment, an RDAN network was pre-trained by zero-shot learning using four large Spot-7 images. At test time, we fine-tuned the parameters of the pre-trained model and iteratively updated them using a single scene of the testing image from the Pleiades satellite. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method was better than zero-shot pansharpening with the same number of epochs, and it was also better than using transfer learning without fine-tuning."

For this purpose, we used an updated version of the Satellite Fire Detection (SFIDE) algorithm to detect hotspots from FCI and SEVIRI imagery, while using thermal anomalies obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Italy as a ground truth. Despite the limitations related to using non-concurrent acquisitions of another satellite as a ground truth and the limited spatial and temporal extension of this preliminary analysis, the results show a significant leap forward in terms of detection sensibility offered by MTG with respect to MSG: while MSG matched only 7% of the thermal anomalies in the MODIS database, MTG matched 34%. This finding highlights the potential of MTG-FCI for operational detection and monitoring of wildfires, volcanic activity, industrial emissions and other applications requiring accurate and timely information on surface temperature variations. Despite the promising results, a validation conducted on a hand-curated thermal anomaly dataset is needed to perform a proper classification accuracy assessment of MTG."

    "abstract": "High-density implantable integrated neural interfaces are at the forefront of treating neural disorders, offering potential for medical advancements. Effective neural recording relies heavily on the noise performance and spatial coverage of the neural interface. The noise performance determines the recording accuracy, while spatial coverage dictates the number of simultaneous recording sites. Typically, increasing spatial coverage and reducing noise presents a trade-off. This paper explores the balance between spatial resolution and noise performance in two types of neural implants: central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) applications. CNS recordings require high spatial resolution to accurately capture neuronal activity, while PNS recordings prioritize low noise levels due to the micro-volt range of neural signals. Despite significant advancements in high-density neural interfaces, current technology still falls short of the spatial density required for neuroscience research. This paper presents a comprehensive strategy for optimizing multiplexed channel structures by addressing factors such as area, signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, and noise limitations. Optimizing the number of electrodes per channel can enhance the performance of neural recording systems. This paper analyzes the design trade-offs and provides insights into the number of electrodes per channel for neural interfaces."

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard unmanned aerial systems (UAS) provides high-resolution images independent of light and weather conditions, making it ideal for automated FOD detection. In this paper, a novel enhanced FOD detection model is proposed, based on the popular You Only Look Once (YOLO). Since FODs are small objects with few pixels, an additional head is inserted into YOLOv8 to specifically enhance small-object feature extraction. Moreover, slice-assisted hyper-inference (SAHI) is employed during the prediction stage to refine detection at multiple scales and reduce missed detections. The model was trained using real experimental data obtained from UAS-borne SAR, and tested on unseen images. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively and efficiently detect FOD with a detection rate of 83.3%."

This study uses hydroclimatic variables such as PET, Evapotranspiration (ET), Precipitation (P), and Groundwater Storage (GWS) data to quantify the long-term P and PET response over climate variability in the Ganges Basin (GB) watersheds using the Budyko framework. Budyko Curve signifies that any change in precipitation and evapotranspiration leads to a shift in the curve, which is indicative of prevailing environmental conditions. Results indicated that the climate change in the GB directly correlates to precipitation, decreased ET, and PET stress in the system (the difference between ET and PET), suggesting that a continuous increase in ET facilitates a reduction in water storage under a warming condition. The agreements between the hydroclimatic variables (ET, P, and PET) indicate a future water balance shift with P and ET uncertainty."

Insights into the abandoned aquaculture ponds and their characteristics remain underexplored but are very crucial in the sustainable aquaculture management. The delineation of abandoned aquaculture ponds has been explored in this study based on pixel based NDWI water frequency, and edge detection techniques in the Cauvery delta of Tamil Nadu using Sentinel time series data. The mean pixel value of aquaculture ponds have been calculated using NDWI water frequency and then classified into operational, semi-operational and non-operational ponds. The pixel-based time series analysis has been used to study the presence and temporal variations of water on the aquaculture ponds. Further, the edge detection techniques were utilized to delineate the abandoned ponds based on their edges and boundaries, since the abandoned ponds have disintegrated boundary due to lack of maintenance. Based on that, the abandoned ponds in the villages of the Cauvery delta districts were delineated and results show that abandoned ponds are prevailing more in the villages of Cuddalore and Mayiladuthurai districts. Understanding the spatial distribution of the coastal abandoned aquaculture ponds will play a vital role in the Sustainable development of the coastal regions."

Finally, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to cluster connected detections into objects.The proposed strategy is applied to PRISMA images acquired over the Venice lagoon, where performance is assessed using vessel navigation messages from the automatic identification system (AIS) as ground-truth information. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of PRISMA mission in the context of maritime surveillance and contribute to increase PRISMA data exploitation possibilities.

Existing algorithms persistently suffer from inherent limitations in inference speed and matching robustness, particularly when processing highly dynamic aerial imagery.

Unlike prior methods that uniformly deploy Transformers over entire feature maps (inducing computational overhead ), AggFormer leverages hierarchical attention with content-aware token selection, substantially optimizing computational resource allocation. Furthermore, a dual-stage correlation layer with integrated subpixel refinement ensures precise correspondences under spatial displacement variations. Extensive experiments validate that AggFormer achieves state-of-the-art matching performance and inference speed compared to existing approaches, establishing its practical value for real-world drone navigation systems."

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor devices, new methods are required to manage their faster switching characteristics, particularly addressing voltage overshoots caused by fast switching. Zero Overvoltage Switching (ZOS) leverages circuit resonances during the turnoff process to nearly eliminate voltage overshoot, making fast switching essential and reducing switching losses to a minimum. This paper explores two methodologies for a novel ZOS current control in DC/DC converters: Variable Frequency Forced Continuous Conduction Mode (VF-FCCM), while efficient under specific conditions, suffers from turn-off overvoltages and significant AC losses due to high current ripple, making it unsuitable for low-load operations. In contrast, Valley Switching Discontinuous Conduction Mode (VS-DCM) mitigates overvoltage spikes and switching losses, maintaining a consistent ripple but struggles with low-load scenarios due to frequency limitations. Both methodologies were simulated and tested on a lightweight aircraft DC/DC prototype. The findings suggest VS-DCM as a promising candidate for future development."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has been applied to edge caching, but its performance often degrades under non-IID user request patterns. Therefore, we propose a cluster-aware caching algorithm where the caching space of the edge server is dynamically allocated to each cluster of similar user devices, while highly requested content from all clusters is stored in a shared cache to maximize the hit ratio of edge devices in strongly non-IID scenarios."

    "abstract": "Distributed machine learning (DML), such as large language model (LLM) training, has become one of the most critical services in multi-tenant cloud computing. However, communication contention among concurrent DML jobs significantly degrades overall GPU utilization, leading to inefficient training cluster performance. Existing approaches either achieve high performance at the cost of long scheduling runtime or reduce scheduling time at the expense of poor performance. We present Harmonics, a novel two-tier scheduling framework that strikes a balance between scheduling latency and performance. It coordinates decisions between Local Schedulers and a lightweight Global Coordinator to enable scalable and adaptive scheduling. By combining rack-level epoch-based optimization with global coordination, Harmonics alleviates communication contention and improves resource efficiency. We implement and evaluate Harmonics on real distributed ML workloads running on a GPU testbed. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as fair sharing, optimal scheduling, Crux, and Cassini, Harmonics reduces training time by up to 33% and communication time by up to 48%. Large-scale simulations show that it reduces scheduling time by up to 91× while improving training time by 26% in large-cluster settings."

Existing solutions to reduce latency primarily focus on enhancing packet loss resistance through redundancy and scheduling transmission orders. However, the performance of these algorithms depends on accurate block transmission time estimation. Current evaluation methods, which do not account for the impacts of complex network protocols and packet loss, result in significant estimation errors.In this paper, we propose Block Completion Time (BCT) as a transmission delay index for block-based applications. We develop a BCT distribution model that incorporates packet-level block transmission under complex protocols and apply it to predict BCT for typical TCP and QUIC protocols. As a use case, we demonstrate how our model can assist in optimizing redundancy configurations. The model is evaluated under varying network conditions, application types, and transport protocols, showing improved accuracy in predicting both the mean and distribution of BCT compared to baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become a cornerstone in advancing artificial intelligence, but their complexity often leads to inefficient hardware utilization due to varying structure characteristics and excessive memory accesses. Domain-specific architectures (DSAs) offer a solution by optimizing data locality through data stationary, tiling, and layer fusion, which minimize memory access and energy consumption while boosting performance. However, current approaches lack flexibility for efficient memory management at the appropriate granularity, causing misaligned accesses and decreasing reuse potential for variable-sized tiles. To this end, we propose a hierarchical Instruction Set Architecture (hierarchical-ISA) combining a RISC-V ISA and a flexible CISC-style macro-ISA (mISA). Unlike byte-level RISC-V, mISA employs row-wise tiles as the fundamental operand, enabling efficient data reuse across adjacent iterations as well as residual connections. This mISA approach simplifies DNN programming, enhances data partitioning and manipulation efficiency, and enables a hardware-software co-designed Remapping mechanism that facilitates data reuse without physical data movement. Experiments show 31.8%–72.0% reductions in off-chip memory access across MobileNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, MobileViT, along with speedups of 2.9× to 7.4× compared to previous DNN accelerators. We also conduct comparisons under the roofline model with NVIDIA RTX A6000 and Intel Core i7-10700K. The results show that our arithmetic intensity reaches up to 26.0× that of i7-10700K and 22.6× that of A6000."

    "abstract": "This article explores the optimal containment control of discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with the digraph and unknown dynamics under process disturbances. We first demonstrate, through a model transformation, that the mean square bounded containment of MASs can be achieved by guaranteeing the mean square boundedness of the containment error systems. Hence, we can transform the optimal stochastic containment control problem of MASs into a stochastic optimal control problem for containment error systems. Subsequently, utilizing the Bellman optimality principle and the stochastic Lyapunov equation (SLE), we design a model-based policy iteration (PI) algorithm for the optimal stochastic containment control of MASs. This model-based algorithm, by minimizing the cost function in linear quadratic form, enables MASs to achieve mean square bounded containment with the least possible energy input. To circumvent the dependency on the model information, we introduce an online model-free algorithm for the stochastic optimal control problem. The model-free algorithm is developed based on the Q-learning algorithm. Specifically, it uses a historical MAS trajectory to estimate the kernel matrix <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i> of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i> function, enabling the resolution of the optimal stochastic containment control problem without model information. To realize the model-free algorithm, the LSTD estimator with bounded bias is employed in the policy evaluation step. We prove the equivalence between the model-free algorithm and the model-based algorithm. Finally, a numerical case is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in achieving the optimal stochastic containment control of MASs."

    "abstract": "Effective regulation of social decision-making is crucial for achieving equitable outcomes in human interactions. This study explores the impact of endogenous regulation on social decision-making and associated neural changes through a neurofeedback (NF) training framework. Given the relationship between social decision making, emotions, and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), this NF training enables individuals to self-regulate their FAA, thereby influencing their decision-making behavior. Eighty-one participants were randomly divided into the up-FAA group aiming at up-regulating FAA, the down-FAA group aiming at down-regulating FAA, and the sham-NF group. First, our results validated the specific NF training effect on selfregulating FAA. Notably, not all participants in the up-FAA and down-FAA groups successfully learned to regulate their FAA, leading to further subdivision into up-learner, down-learner, up-nonlearner, and down-nonlearner categories based on learning efficacy. Participants who effectively learned to reduce their FAA (down-learners) showed significant changes in decision behavior under moderately unfair conditions, characterized by increased rejection rates during the ultimatum game (UG) task. They also exhibited larger N200 amplitudes while balancing the decisionmaking period. In contrast, up learners demonstrated minimal behavioral changes despite increases in FAA. We conclude that decreases in FAA have a more pronounced impact on social decision-making than increases during NF training. This study highlights the effects of FAA self-regulation on fairness-related decision-making, revealing the neurobiological factors that shape decisions influenced by fairness perceptions. These findings offer valuable insights for enhancing social cooperation and justice."

    "abstract": "With rapid advancements in technology, Taiwan has become a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. Over the past decade, process technologies have continually advanced, reaching the latest 1.2 nm node. However, as feature sizes shrink, the complexity of processes increases, leading to more stringent requirements for the stability of the manufacturing environment. Cleanroom environments have become increasingly critical in semiconductor manufacturing, significantly impacting production capacity and yield. In the equipment front-end module (EFEM), we observed that when the front opening unified pod (FOUP) door is opened, internal pressure differentials can cause air ingress into the microenvironment. This ingested air may carry moisture and oxygen, which, upon entering the FOUP, can damage the wafers, leading to decreased yield. In real-world scenarios, we found that despite the use of laminar air curtain devices, wafer box yields remained unstable due to the influence of inclined airflow. To simulate this situation, our experiment utilized flow field visualization to observe the effects of different air curtain flow rates (0.3 m/s,0.4 m/s and 0.5 m/s) and environmental wind speeds (0.3 m/s and 0.5 m/s) on inclined airflows (7∘, 15∘, and 30∘) when the FOUP door is opened. While flow field visualization provided clear images of airflow directions, it could not determine whether the ingested air contained contaminants harmful to the wafers. Therefore, we supplemented our experiment with relative humidity monitoring data to identify whether the ingested air originated from the external environment or the air curtain device itself, providing effective recommendations based on the findings."

    "abstract": "The popularization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has raised critical concerns about public security and personal privacy, necessitating drone recognition technology. Radio frequency-based monitoring methods are widely used because of their advantage of non-line-of-sight. However, most existing radio frequency-based recognition methods have closed-set assumption vulnerabilities. Although several open-set methods have been proposed, they still face robustness deficiencies when video transmission signal attenuation conditions are severe or when interference signals are present. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight open-set drone recognition (LOSDR) method. First, IQ data are transformed into time-frequency spectra via a short-time Fourier transform. Second, regional block details and global frequency-hopping patterns are jointly extracted via a flight control signal block extractor and pattern extractors. Then, a semantic alignment module, which integrates text embeddings derived from the contrastive language-image pretraining model, and a class decorrelation module with orthogonal constraints are designed to increase the degree of interclass separation and reduce the ambiguity of classification. Additionally, an adaptive dynamic entropy threshold mechanism is used to balance known/unknown decisions under varying noise and interference levels. We construct datasets for three different electromagnetic environments. Extensive experiments conducted on these datasets demonstrate that LOSDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalizability and accuracy."

Notably, the proposed AIDE-TC strategy is based on the average control rate, which makes the theoretical conditions more applicable to practical scenarios. In contrast to fixed-time synchronization, we design a time-varying function to ensure that all states of CNs converge to a common adjustable region within a user-defined time. Moreover, unlike the existing literature that considers bounded time-varying coupling weights, this paper employs average time-varying coupling weights to relax the requirements for the coupling weights. More importantly, a new auxiliary function is designed to overcome the difficulties caused by intermittent control in practical PTS. By constructing a Lyapunov function with the auxiliary function, we derive the practical PTS criterion for CNs with time-varying coupling. Meanwhile, the Zeno phenomenon is excluded when the coupling weights have an upper bound. Finally, we present a numerical simulation applied to an islanded microgrid system to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results."

The interaction between the two players is modeled as a Bayesian game: the Defender infers the Attacker’s representation from its trajectory and places barriers to counteract, while the Attacker obfuscates its representation type to mislead the Defender. We solve for the Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium via a bilinear program that integrates Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief manipulation. Simulations show that purposeful concealment naturally emerges: the Attacker randomizes its trajectory to manipulate the Defender’s belief, inducing suboptimal barrier selections and thereby gaining a strategic advantage."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become the mainstream approach for SAR image despeckling. However, the lack of speckle-free SAR images poses a significant challenge for supervised deep learning methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose a self-supervised SAR despeckling method that leverages a denoiser prior and attributed scattering centers to enhance the training process. Specifically, we use the output of an external denoiser as a pseudo-label for despeckling, while spatially correlated speckle noise in SAR images is decorrelated through random downsampling. The network is then updated by optimizing the similarity between its output and the pseudo-label. Additionally, an attributed scattering center map is introduced to help the network recognize strong scatterers and better preserve image details. Experiments on both synthetic and real SAR datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing despeckling approaches. Specifically, our method improves ENL by 16% over the recent self-supervised MERLIN framework on the TerraSAR scene. Meanwhile, our method achieves MOR and VOR values that are closer to the ideal value of 1.0. The code of our work is made freely available at https://github.com/Duan-NUDT/SARDIDP_ASC."

However, existing solutions typically rely on basic encryption methods and shallow feature extraction, leading to inadequate data security and poor retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Stage Encryption (DMSE) method combined with a semantically rich fusion feature to achieve high-precision and privacy-preserving image retrieval in edge environments. Specifically, the proposed method first divides the image into blocks and applies random shuffling, followed by channel and pixel-level XOR encryption to generate a hybrid encrypted image. Then, we extract global features from the encrypted image using the histogram of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. In addition, a multi-scale convolution block is designed to extract stable and robust local features under encryption. Finally, deep learning is utilized to fuse the global and local features, capturing both the holistic structure and fine-grained semantics of the image. This comprehensive feature representation significantly improves retrieval accuracy while ensuring privacy. Extensive experiments validate that our approach outperforms existing methods in both security and retrieval effectiveness, making it well-suited for edge computing scenarios with limited resources and high privacy demands."

    "abstract": "This article presents a 0.7mW, 9.1–14GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) designed for quantum applications and characterized at both room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). By performing numerical analysis, the temperature coefficients of the dominant noise mechanisms from 300 to 4 K are extracted. Furthermore, a practical methodology is proposed for simulating cryogenic RF performance without requiring an accurate cryogenic process design kit (PDK). By modifying the electromagnetic (EM) substrate model and adjusting the simulation temperature to 200 K, the simulated S-parameters and power consumption closely match the measured results at 4 K. Fabricated in 90-nm complimentary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS), the stacked inverter–common-source LNA consumes 0.7mW at 4 K and achieves 15.5dB gain with a 9.1–14GHz bandwidth and 0.9dB minimum noise figure (NF). The measured noise is reduced by a factor of 5.72 at 12GHz and 3.68 at 9GHz when cooled from 300 to 4 K, and a temperature coefficient of 3.33 is extracted for induced channel noise."

Although CMPC is simple to implement, it faces challenges such as variations in switching frequency and the complex tuning of weighting factors. SMPC addresses these issues by prioritising control objectives sequentially, eliminating weighting factors, and simplifying controller design. The simulation results demonstrate that SMPC improves the tracking of output currents, reduces harmonic distortion, and improves the balancing of DC link voltages under both steady-state and transient conditions. These findings establish SMPC as a robust alternative to CMPC, improving power quality and system performance in multi-level converter applications."

These constructed atmospheric profiles were applied to radiometric calibration experiments conducted in September 2021, with experimental data derived from MODIS and GF-1 WFV sensors. The results demonstrate that the constructed atmospheric profiles significantly improve radiometric calibration accuracy, exhibiting lower relative errors and root mean square errors (RMSE) compared to the MODTRAN standard profiles. Specifically, the RMSE of the monthly, seasonal, and annual atmospheric profiles improved by 1.811%, 2.418%, and 2.223% on average, respectively. In particular, the seasonal profiles performed exceptionally well in capturing atmospheric stratification, further validating their effectiveness in radiometric calibration for remote sensing applications."

Due to the limited annotation data available in remote sensing images, numerous studies have focused on data augmentation as a means to alleviate overfitting in deep learning networks. However, some existing data augmentation strategies rely on simple transformations that may not sufficiently enhance data diversity or model generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a novel augmentation strategy, Clustered-Patch-Mixed Mosaic (CP2M), designed to address these limitations. CP2M integrates a Mosaic augmentation phase with a clustered patch mix phase. The former stage constructs a new sample from four random samples, while the latter phase uses the connected component labeling algorithm to ensure the augmented data maintains spatial coherence and avoids introducing irrelevant semantics when pasting random patches. Our experiments on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset demonstrate that CP2M substantially mitigates overfitting, setting new benchmarks for segmentation accuracy and model robustness in remote sensing tasks.

Furthermore, the computational complexity of conventional numerical approaches increases substantially with the growing electrical dimensions of the domain of interest. This study proposes a deep learning (DL)-based framework to address these challenges, offering a computationally efficient solution while simultaneously tackling the inherent non-uniqueness of the ill-posed problem. The proposed framework employs an inverse neural network (INN) architecture comprising a dense layer network to map backscatter EM fields into a lower-dimensional latent space constrained to follow a Gaussian distribution. A pre-trained generator reconstructs the scatterer shapes from this latent representation, while a pre-trained forward neural network (FNN) imposes physical constraints to resolve the non-uniqueness issue. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the trained INN, achieving a mean binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss of 0.04 and a structural similarity index (SSI) of 0.94 on test data. The findings underscore the potential of DL-based approaches to overcome existing limitations in EM imaging and contribute to advancements in computationally efficient scatterer reconstruction techniques."

    "abstract": "Point cloud is an important type of geometric data structure for many robotics or 3D applications such as Autonomous Driving, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR). Raw point clouds generated by 3D sensors are typically large-scale and irregular. For these reasons, most of point cloud applications require an expensive down-sampling pre-processing phase for the raw point cloud to regularize it. With the traditional down-sampling methods, this preprocessing phase often accounts for the majority of the end-toend latency. Recently, the Octree-based pre-processing method has been proposed to efficiently perform the down-sampling phase. Building on this approach and the spatial proximity function of Octree nodes, we propose an Approximate Octree-Indexed Sampling (OIS) method to further accelerate Octreebased down-sampling and implement it as an FPGA-based accelerator, functioning as a near-sensor processor. In our evaluation, using benchmarks from three popular point cloud datasets, we first present the theoretical workload savings (ranging from 27.3% to 50%) achieved through the optimization of the approximation method. We then demonstrate that, compared to the current Octree-based down-sampling accelerator, our FPGA-based prototype accelerator performing the Approximate OIS method achieves additional speedups ranging from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.5 \\times$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.01 \\times$</tex>.

Previous studies have shown that adversarial training can alter the frequency bias of deep learning models, but its impact on model bias and decision-making behavior in SAR image classification remains underexplored. This study investigates how adversarial training affects these aspects in the context of SAR image classification. Using the MSTAR dataset, we trained the ResNet18, ResNet34 and ResNet50 models under standard training and PGD adversarial training, resulting in both standard and robust models. To analyze the effects, we leveraged mask information from the SARBake dataset to segment images into shadow, target, and background regions. These segmented regions were separately tested on both standard and robust models. By comparing the classification accuracy of the two types of models across different regions, the study provides insight into how adversarial training influences model bias and decision behavior, contributing to the development of more explainable and reliable SAR classification models."

The OGC has highlighted that cell geometry is a primary feature of Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS). While the cell area, shape, and uniformity have been extensively discussed, the \"cell wall midpoint ratio\" has often been overlooked. In this study, we quantified the geometric characteristics of this index for equal-area DGGS models, based on the Snyder projection, with three different cells shapes: triangle, diamond, and hexagon. Experimental results reveal that DGGS models with the same cell shape exhibit similar geometric characteristics, which resemble the deformation patterns of the Snyder projection. Additionally, the \"cell wall midpoint ratio\" deviation for diamond-shaped DGGS is slightly smaller than that of triangular and hexagonal models. These geometric characteristics provide a foundation for grid selection in discrete differential computations on spherical surfaces and enhance the reliability, credibility, and practicality of DGGSs across various fields and applications."

The proposed approach finds a model for the phase of the whole Doppler history corresponding to a target height and/or motion to be retrieved. Then, for each target, the model parameters are robustly and efficiently estimated by maximizing the coherence, i.e. the alignment, of the Doppler history phasors with the phase model.

    "abstract": "Significant target energy focusing is a prerequisite for effective detection and synthetic aperture imaging with airborne radar. However, it is inevitably to confront two main issues for low altitude high-speed target energy focusing: One is the strong clutter component in the echo may shelter the target energy. The other is the high-speed motion may cause severe range migration (RM) and then shorten the focusing period. To address these issues, it is common to perform serial processing for space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and coherent integration (CI) based RM correction. Therefore, this paper presents a joint implementation method based on Radon-STAP, which is different from the traditional serial processing. First, the target RM is converted into phase variation through Fourier transform (FT) along fast time dimension. Next, the RM-Doppler joint compensation filter is designed. Finally, the improved space-time adaptive filtering is implemented to obtain the results of energy focusing by joint clutter suppression and CI. The results of numerical simulation and real-measured data processing validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Therefore, correcting weather radar observations that are partially or fully blocked is an indispensable step in radar data quality control and subsequent quantitative applications, especially in complex terrain environments such as the western United States. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for correcting partial beam blockage regions in polarimetric radar observations. Data from the KDAX radar, located in northern California, is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The corrected data are validated with disdrometer measurements during independent precipitation events in northern California. The results show that the deep learning-based approach effectively addresses the data discontinuity caused by partial beam blockage, with the corrected radar observations showing strong agreement with ground truth. The beam blockage correction has a positive impact on radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), demonstrated by a significant improvement in the average of reflectivity and rainfall rate estimates, highlighting its potential for enhancing precipitation mapping in complex terrain regions."

To address this, this paper proposes a deep learning-based complex-valued (CV) binary transform (BT) substituting FFT within MMW FMCW signal processing. Specifically, a deep network with a two-path symmetric CV binary structure is introduced to realize transformation from echo to range domain and its inversion, respectively, which ensures frequency analysis characteristic and invertibility of CVBT. Subsequently, we establish a loss with range and echo information, and then learn binary weights in the CV structure by data-driven back propagation. Lastly, the targets can be detected in range domain with the well-trained single-path forward propagation of CVBT, which merely demands CV addition operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed CVBT."

Then, the transfer function of the big squint SAR simulation system is constructed, and the existing data is convolved with the transfer function.

The proposed method designs a correlational mapping constraint module and added into the network structure of SegFormer, to control the self-attention interval in the search image. Meanwhile, a cross-modal attention module is constructed to facilitate better interaction between two modalities and enhance the response of feature weights of both modalities in the other modality. Moreover, an optimal transmission module is first introduced to formulate the optimization for similarity evaluation in multi-modal image matching. Different features are given different importance through the class activation map, which effectively avoids the situation that multiple points are matched to the same point. Finally, experimental results illustrate that the proposed method obtains more accurate matching than other compared methods and meanwhile reduces the matching time."

To mitigate these issues in the conventional single-phase transformer-based traction substations, this paper proposes a unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) designed to compensate negative-sequence currents and load voltage variations. This paper first introduces the topological structure and compensation principles of the proposed UPQC system. Subsequently, a detailed control framework for each compensation function is presented. Finally, a Matlab/Simulink model is developed, and simulation results are analysed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation strategy."

    "abstract": "While recent progress in multi-actuator control systems has yielded notable improvements, prevailing architectures continue to exhibit limitations in optimizing cost efficiency, control precision, and physical compactness. Many solutions rely on custom circuitry or specialized controllers, which increase costs and hinder scalability. In addition, general-purpose platforms that are reproducible and suitable for hardware validation or educational use in reconfigurable electromagnetic systems remain scarce. To address these limitations, this paper presents a highprecision multi-point motion control system featuring a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> matrix of electromagnetic linear actuators (solenoids) controlled by a single Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller. The system enables independent and coordinated control of nine actuators via a custom H-bridge driver array and a power architecture that ensures voltage stability during switching. The Arduino manages the timing of each actuator's motion, supporting both sequential and simultaneous control depending on the mode. Functional mode allows concurrent activation for rapid execution, while debugging mode supports stepwise testing of individual actuators. Key innovations include (1) a tightly integrated control architecture managed by a single microcontroller, (2) a stable multipoint power management scheme, and (3) a compact mechanical assembly based on a modular 3D-printed frame. Experimental validation confirms reliable push-pull motion across all actuators with low latency and consistent performance. Compared to existing tactile and microfluidic actuator systems, the proposed platform achieves a better balance between integration and flexibility, while demonstrating good scalability. This work establishes a technical foundation for larger electromagnetic actuator arrays and shows strong potential in applications such as smart reflecting surfaces (SRS), mechanically driven phasedarray radar systems, and tunable radio frequency (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R F}$</tex>) reflector platforms."

    "abstract": "Directly implementing intelligent real-time processing on the satellite can effectively reduce data processing latency and alleviate communication burdens. Existing convolution neural networks (CNNs) typically have a huge magnitude of parameters and intensive computation, making it a challenge to deploy CNN-based models onboard. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes an extremely pipelined FPGA-based accelerator with both algorithm and hardware optimization for SAR satellite on-board real-time processing. Firstly, in order to reduce the hardware resource overhead, convolution kernel weights and activations are quantized to signed and unsigned integers respectively, lightening the pressure of computing resource overhead. Secondly, a multi-level data prefetching strategy is proposed to optimize the data flow and resource consumption, making it possible to eliminate expensive off-chip memory access. Finally, an accelerator that computes all layers in simultaneous pipeline is proposed, significantly reducing the latency of data processing. Extensive experiments conducted on AMD-Xilinx XC7VX690T FPGA board show that the mAP reaches 93.5% on SSDD dataset while the throughput of the accelerator achieves 1.72 tera operation per second (TOPS) with 15.302W in 200MHz, demonstrating the capability of proposed accelerator for real-time processing."

Both EMO1 and EMO5 datasets are available, but this study utilized EMO1 due to its high spatial resolution of 1.5km. Through comprehensive validation against flux tower measurements across nine agricultural sites, we assessed the reliability of EMO1-derived meteorological variables. The analysis spans a decade (2011-2020), focused on validating air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, and shortwave radiation, crucial for crop photosynthesis modelling (gross primary production: GPP). Statistical criteria, including the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (>0.42), normalized root mean square error (<0.1), and correlation coefficient (>0.85) demonstrated strong agreement across all variables and all sites. Although vapour pressure deficit showed slightly lower performance compared to the other variables, its accuracy was still sufficient for estimating crop GPP. A light use efficiency model was employed to estimate GPP at one site as a case study to illustrate the agricultural application of EMO1 data. The consistency observed between EMO1-driven and flux tower-driven GPP estimations further validated the applicability of EMO1 data in crop photosynthesis modelling. This study validated EMO1 for agricultural applications, with potential extensions to diverse ecosystems, supporting sustainable agricultural practices and carbon sequestration studies."

However, as the demand for applications increased, the response time and data coverage of the single satellite became limited. To address this, GaoFen-3B (GF-3B) and GaoFen-3C (GF-3C) were launched in 2021 and 2022, forming China’s first SAR constellation with GF-3, significantly reducing revisit cycles and improving data timeliness and richness. The new satellites feature several technical improvements, including advanced imaging modes, automatic identification system (AIS) data reception, and real-time data processing. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the system design, technological highlights, and operational applications of the GF-3 satellite, analyzes the current status and technical improvements of the GF-3 constellation, and explores its promising future applications."

Renewable energy meets increasing energy demands while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, so advancing UN SDG 7 for clean energy access and SDG 13 for climate action. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) deliver essential financial services to marginalized communities via small loans, savings, and insurance products [2]. The integration of microfinance with solar energy assists rural populations in surmounting energy poverty and financial exclusion. Microfinance empowers households, especially women, by augmenting economic engagement and mitigating dangers.

Recent work proposes relocating the bulk DC-link capacitance from each moving monorail and the central supply onto the rail itself by distributing capacitors along the conductor. This strategy simplifies vehicle construction and reduces mass. Because the distributed capacitor conductor rail behaves as a transmission line with greatly reduced propagation velocity, its wave-propagation properties can be exploited to improve short-circuit performance and achieve a nearly zero-current switch-off point. This paper presents a protection scheme that leverages that effect. A detection method identifies the optimal instant for fault interruption, and experimental results confirm the method’s effectiveness."

We calculate the feature description vectors with radiation resistance using the direction index of the largest feature value in the direction dimension. Finally, we obtain a large number of high-accuracy tie points by an effective outlier removal strategy. We integrate the proposed method into a relative geometric calibration scheme, and experimental results on multiple Ganfen-1B multispectral images show that the proposed method outperforms the SIFT method in terms of calibration success rate and calibration residual."

    "abstract": "This study introduces DiffRPTraj, a novel framework for generating realistic pedestrian trajectories using diffusion models while incorporating essential spatiotemporal features. Unlike traditional generative models like GANs or VAEs, diffusion models in DiffRPTraj offer superior accuracy by addressing the challenges of capturing intricate environmental interactions and preserving data privacy. Key contributions of this work include integrating conditional information, such as occupancy grid maps and spatiotemporal density matrices, to enhance trajectory realism. The framework employs Traj-UNet, an adaptation of the UNet architecture, to model noise prediction effectively at each diffusion timestep, ensuring the generated trajectories align closely with real-world patterns. Additionally, novel modules such as the map image encoder and spatial density image encoder are introduced to handle diverse spatiotemporal characteristics. Extensive evaluations on a real-world indoor pedestrian dataset demonstrate DiffRPTraj’s superior performance over existing methods, with enhanced spatial and temporal density accuracy, trajectory realism, and adaptability to diverse spatiotemporal density distributions. Compared to the baseline model, we improved the similarity of spatiotemporal density distributions by up to 260% when evaluating with data having the same spatiotemporal density distribution and up to 2949% when evaluating with data having different spatiotemporal density distributions. These findings underscore DiffRPTraj’s potential applications in urban planning, public safety, and privacy-preserving mobility analysis."

This paper proposes the first high-precision dynamic phasor model of resonant DAB inverters that allows model linearization and the analysis of the resonant inductor current even without any relevant current sensor. Moreover, this paper derives the analytical expression for the Fourier coefficients of switch functions using the double Fourier series. Simulation and experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed model. The voltage error under a 50% load change is less than 3%, leading to an accuracy improvement of over 20% compared with the FHA model."

To our knowledge, this is the first paper on the implementation of AC in edge devices. It investigates the performance of the Season Aware Atmospheric Correction Network (SAAC-Net) on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin for edge deployment, with the PARAM Shavak DL GPU, a high-performance enterprise system, serving as a benchmark for comparison. The model’s performance is analyzed across different precision levels (FP32, FP16, INT8) and frameworks (TensorFlow, TensorRT). The results reveal that the quantization reduced model sizes from 30MB (FP32) to 2.5MB (INT8). Ten-Sorflow FP32 achieves the lowest RMSE (0.055) on both platforms, with the PARAM Shavak GPU exhibiting slower inference times (45 seconds). In contrast, TensorRT on the Jetson AGX Orin significantly accelerates inference (≈0.96 seconds with INT8) but introduces increased RMSE (0.73 for INT8). These findings underscore the trade-offs between memory usage, accuracy, and speed, offering insights for optimizing deep learning models for edge-based AC."

Four prominent CNN architectures, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, are utilized to extract spatial features from video frames, while the LSTM component captures temporal dependencies to model the progression of fatigue-related facial dynamics. The evaluation leverages the NTHU Driver Drowsiness Detection (NTHU-DDD) dataset, which encompasses challenging visual conditions such as varying illumination and the use of glasses or sunglasses. Preprocessing steps include facial landmark detection, cropping, normalization, and construction of sequential input. Among all tested models, DenseNet121 demonstrates the most robust performance, achieving 94.63% accuracy and exhibiting high recall in detecting drowsy states. The findings underscore the model’s strong generalization capabilities across diverse real-world conditions, positioning DenseNet121 as a highly promising candidate for deployment in vision-based Advanced Driver Monitoring Systems (ADMS)."

However, to push the performance limits for the next generation of high-power-density power converters, research into integrated passive components-such as inductors, capacitors, and transformers into a single structure is essential. This manuscript presents an integrated self-resonating transformer based on Flexible Multilayer Foil (FMLF) for CLLC converters. In this design, all resonant components on both the primary and secondary sides-such as leakage or physical inductance and capacitance-are combined into a single unit, referred to as a Self-Resonant Transformer. This not only reduces the volume, but also the cost and weight of the overall system thereby enabling next-gen highly power dense converters. Moreover, the proposed structure employs a novel trifilar winding configuration to mitigate the effects of bypass capacitance typically observed in conventional winding arrangements. Analysis, design, and experimental measurements are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed structure."

Spatiotemporal trends in precipitation (PPT), soil moisture (SM), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and liquid water equivalent (LWE) were examined for 2015– 2024. All variables exhibited trends of increasing availability, indicating recovery from the 2015–2016 drought in the region.

Therefore, the ability to map seawater inundation and water level using limited information is critical for effective emergency management. This study utilizes high-resolution satellite image and social media data collected during the seawater intrusion event in Erjiegou Town in October 2024. An improved Residual Neural Network(ResNet) model is employed to extract water level data from social media data, which is then integrated with seawater inundation information derived from satellite image to generate a seawater intrusion water level map.

To comply with electromagnetic interference (EMI) regulations, dc-side passive filters are needed, which can contribute up to 30% of the total converter weight/volume. Consequently, active filters (AFs) are of interest: Even though the AF effectiveness becomes limited at higher frequencies, the cutoff frequency of the remaining passive filter can be increased and its size thus substantially reduced. This paper proposes a common-mode (CM) AF for six-switch three-phase VSIs operated with standard SPWM or SVM. The AF only requires two low-voltage half bridges and a capacitive injection network. The operating principle, sensitivities, and design aspects are presented, and detailed circuit simulations of an industrial motor drive (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 0 0 ~ V ~ d c, ~} \\mathbf{2. 5 ~ k W}$</tex>, IEC <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 1 8 0 0 - 3 ~ E M I}$</tex> limits, 24 V AF supply) and an EV traction inverter (800 V dc, 125 kW, CISPR 25 EMI limits, 48 V AF supply) verify the concept, indicating a reduction of the required CM filter inductance by a factor of 2 (EV) to 6 (industrial) compared to a passive filter."

    "abstract": "Accurately mapping wildfire extent and dynamics in boreal forests is essential for climate and ecological research. Currently, only two medium-resolution burned area datasets, generated based on a large number of visual interpretation samples, are available for research on the entire Boreal Forest: the Global Forest Loss (Fire_GFL) and the Global Annual Burned Area Map (GABAM). Fire_GFL has an 8% omission in North America and globally, while GABAM suffers from severe \"stripe\" and \"box\" effects, making it unsuitable for use. Therefore, a new burned area dataset covering the boreal region is needed for more precise wildfire mapping. This study develops a large-scale fully automated wildfire extraction algorithm named BAMS for the boreal forests, which can automatically generate training samples. Its effectiveness and robustness are tested using the 2023 Canadian wildfires as a case study. Compared to the TIIC produced by Natural Resources Canada and the publicly released Fire_GFL, BAMS achieved the highest OA of 93%, compared to 91% and 86%, respectively. At the regional scale, BAMS shows a strong correlation and consistency with TIIC, while the forest burned area estimated by Fire_GFL is systematically lower than that of BAMS and TIIC. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed method can accurately and automatically delineate wildfire areas in boreal forests."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Silicon Carbide (SiC) Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) have become prominent in power electronics applications due to their low on-state resistance and high switching speed. However, parasitic elements in circuits can cause surge voltage and current imbalance, potentially degrading these advantages. Accurate circuit simulation is essential for effective design and verification. This paper presents an advanced Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) model for SiC MOSFETs that includes third-quadrant characteristics and reverse recovery behavior, crucial for applications utilizing the internal reverse diode (body diode). The third-quadrant model incorporates gate-source voltage (Vgs) and temperature dependence. The reverse recovery model, which is implemented as a newly proposed diffusion capacitance model using simple fitting parameters, replicates the current and temperature dependence. Validation through experimental comparisons shows high accuracy, with peak recovery voltage within an error of 2% and peak recovery current within an error of 7%, in the given experimental condition. It is a practical tool for circuit design, accurately reproducing reverse recovery current and surge voltage, including temperature dependencies. This advanced SPICE model enhances the reliability and efficiency of SiC MOSFET-based systems, aiding engineers in optimizing circuit designs."

These include manual filtering, fixed thresholds, and difficulties balancing accuracy with point cloud density. To overcome these, we propose an Adaptive Statistical Outlier Removal (ASOR) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts filtering factors and iterations based on the standard deviation (STD) gradient between ICESat-2 data and reference DEM. Validated in glacier melting ASOR increased point cloud density by 27.4% and 65.6% compared to SOR and DBSCAN, respectively, while maintaining accuracy. Reliable performance in multiple Scenarios deformation monitoring of glaciers, mines, and urban surfaces. It captured glacier melting trends in the Pyrenees, detected a 41.5 m topographic change in Puertollano, and achieved a 0.81 correlation with InSAR for urban subsidence in Lorca. ASOR offers an efficient, scalable approach to multiple scenarios deformation monitoring, reducing manual intervention."

In the system, a main inverter outputs pulsating power to the motor for a power factor correction, and an additional inverter compensates for power pulsation by charging and discharging a floating capacitor. However, the floating capacitor capacitance becomes larger with mechanical output, resulting in an increase in the system size. The proposed control method controls an additional inverter output power variably on the basis of load condition. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method, as the capacitor capacity is reduced by 43% compared to the conventional control method. The proposed control method contributes to the system miniaturization of the electrolytic capacitor-less dual inverter with the single-phase power supply."

Multi-polarization and height-resolved backscatter profiles from BorealScat-2 were analyzed alongside sap flux and VPD measurements. Temporal heatmaps highlighted distinct backscatter dynamics, with the mid-to-upper canopy (14 to 20 m) having influence on radar signals. Diurnal cycles of backscatter intensity correlated strongly with sap flux density under varying VPD conditions, demonstrating the radar’s sensitivity to canopy water dynamics. Co-polarized backscatter (HH and VV) consistently exhibited stronger and more stable correlations with sap flux compared to cross-polarized signals. By integrating BorealScat-2 radar data with physiological and meteorological variables, this study underscores the potential of L-band radar backscatter as a proxy for transpiration and forest water exchange processes. The findings enhance understanding of the interplay between environmental factors and radar scattering mechanisms, contributing to advancements in radar-based monitoring of forest hydrology and evapotranspiration."

An increasing trend, ranging from 0.002 to 0.02/year with 95% confidence, was observed across all seven sub-regions from 2001 to 2013. The highest increase rates were found in North China and South China, both at 0.02/year.

In Sweden, boreal forests are comprehensively mapped using airborne laser scanning and photography, which provide high- resolution data that limits the additional value SAR can offer due to its relatively lower resolution, despite its ability to acquire data under all weather conditions. However, by addressing the various factors that currently hinder the extraction of useful information from SAR images, the technology holds significant potential for applications such as vegetation and subsurface mapping, including soil conditions and tree root analysis. This study introduces a drone-based SAR experiment configured to capture the forest at an exceptionally high spatial resolution, tailored for root analysis. Additionally, SAR tomographic processing is employed to produce a 3D reconstruction of tree roots and trunks. Extensive reference datasets for both vegetation and soil, gathered through complementary sensors and methodologies, support groundbreaking analyses in this domain."

The proposed approach not only achieves primary objectives such as global power sharing (GPS) and DC link voltage regulation of ILC but also improves overall system stability through advanced ILC control techniques. Developed based on regulating the energy stored in the DC link capacitor, this method enables grid-forming operation for both the DC-AC and DC-DC converters of the ILC and eliminates the necessity for a phase-locked loop (PLL).

In this research, we propose a deep learning framework for wildfire detection that leverages GOES observations downscaled to a spatial resolution of 500 meters using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The VI-IRS high-resolution images serve as target labels during the training phase. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a high 500m spatial resolution while maintaining the high temporal resolution of GOES, enabling more precise and timely wildfire detection."

Understanding these teleconnections provides crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying hydrometeorological phenomena, particularly hydrological switches—rapid transitions between extreme events such as droughts and floods. These switches have become increasingly prevalent across the contiguous United States (CONUS), fueled by climate variability and evolving atmospheric patterns.This study utilizes cross-wavelet transform analysis to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrological switches and their correlations with major teleconnection indices, including NAO, ONI, WP, PDO, PNA, and QBO. The findings indicate significant coherence between hydrological switches and teleconnection indices across different temporal scales, with ONI and QBO showing dominant correlations at frequencies of 16–32 months across all regions from 1951 to 2023. Phase analysis reveals a mix of synchronized and lagged impacts, highlighting the intricate interactions between teleconnections and hydrological extremes.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the impact of hardware-induced faults on neural networks performing image classification tasks has gained a lot of attention. Specifically, failures have been directly associated with wrong classifications. When it comes to different tasks, this association is less explicit. For example, the critical impact of hardware-induced faults on image segmentation tasks is less interpretable. In this work, we propose a novel technique for detecting critical permanent faults, relying on a dataset profiling phase to extract four metrics. These metrics are designed to assess and monitor the area, position, symmetry, and shape of prediction patterns across the output mask at the pixel level. Validation was performed through a statistical fault injection campaign on Fast-SCNN model trained on Cityscapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a Faulty Output Dataset (FOD) was developed and employed to compare state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics, such as Pixel Accuracy (PA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), with the proposed one. The results show a high capability to detect critical faults, with an accuracy greater than 99%, comparable to SOTA methods, but with the advantage that the proposed method does not require a golden mask, increasing its applicability in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Object detection is a crucial step in the analysis of remote sensing images. Remote sensing images often encompass vast scenes characterized by significant variations in object scales. The inherent characteristics of remote sensing images often lead to inaccurate detection results. As a result, to improve object detection performance, it is essential to enhance the model’s capability to capture multi-scale features. To address this issue, we propose a group convolution attention (GCA) module to increase the performance of multi-scale object detection. The GCA module consists of a feature grouping module (FGM) and an attention extraction module (AEM). The FGM performs grouped convolutions on the features extracted by the backbone network to obtain features with improved scale representation. Then, the AEM extracts channel attention weights from the features obtained by the FGM to obtain cross channel attention for multi-scale features. These process captures cross-channel attention and contextual information, increasing the representation of multi-scale features of the object. We conducted experiments employing models such as the object detection algorithms Faster R-CNN, YOLOX, and RtmDet. Comparative and ablation experiments were performed on datasets DIOR, MS_Building and SSDD. The experimental results demonstrate that the network incorporating the GCA module improves object detection performance, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Satellite-based monitoring offers an efficient approach to tracking these plantations; however, the resolution of existing datasets often limits their ability to capture the detailed spatial dynamics of oil palm cultivation. This study presents the development of a high-resolution oil palm plantation map for Indonesia and Malaysia using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with a 10-meter spatial resolution. The proposed method utilizes existing oil palm maps as noisy labels and employs a U-Net segmentation model to produce precise, high-resolution outputs. To address the resolution mismatch between existing maps and high-resolution imagery, a Determinant-based Mutual Information (DMI) loss function is integrated during model training. Bayesian inference is subsequently applied to refine the results and merge them with the Annual Oil Palm Area Dataset, a previous oil palm plantation map. The resulting map exhibits significantly greater detail and accuracy compared to previous datasets, achieving an F1 Score of 0.72, a 21.86% higher user accuracy, and a 25.85% higher overall accuracy.

Due to its critical role in managing water resources, this study will evaluate the three satellite-based ET estimation products, having Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-derived ET as ground truth. The ground truth data is acquired from a height of 200 m over irrigated cotton fields with thermal orthomosaics based on Zenmuse H20T thermal camera integrated into Matrice 300 RTK UAV. We explore and compare three satellite-based ET data over these agricultural fields to uncover their usage potential in practice at time t. The first data is Landsat-based Analysis Ready Data (ARD) called the Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux), which provides 30 m resolution global ET data but with limited time resolution, 16 days. The second dataset is Sentinel-1-based ET data, generated using a pre-trained U-Net structure with the SAR2ET model, providing regular updates based on Sentinel-1 passes. The last one is based on the Sen-ET using Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model and proposed for obtaining high (~ 20 m) resolution ET data from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 as inputs.A general underestimation and reduced variability —a narrower range of values— are observed for all satellite-based ET products compared to the RGB+thermal UAV-based ET values, likely due to the coarse spatial resolution that the spatial variability of ET cannot be detected. Compared to the Landsat-based ARD ET estimations, the Sentinel-2/-3-based ET estimations displayed higher agreement with UAV acquisitions. This could be related to calibrating the model with more site-specific conditions at acquisition time, leading to capturing the RGB+thermal UAV-based ET values. Given that SAR2ET is trained by EEFlux data, SAR2ET model-based ET estimations are, as expected, closer to the one from EEFlux."

    "abstract": "Studying snowline elevation changes is crucial for understanding the cryosphere's response to climate change and provides important data for water resource management in snow-dominated regions. This paper presents a snowline monitoring method based on GF-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery, utilizing the DeepLabV3+ model to identify snow cover and cloud in images. A multi-source, multi-temporal data fusion strategy is proposed, where snowline elevations are derived through the integration of DEM data. This method effectively addresses the challenges of cloud cover and data gaps in mountainous regions, enabling precise detection of the snowline at a fine scale. The Galongla Mountain region was selected as the study area. The results indicated that from 2013 to 2023, the snowline elevation of Galongla Mountain fluctuated between 4200 and 4700 meters, with an overall upward trend. On the south slope, snowline elevation showed more significant variation due to factors such as water vapor and topography, while the north slope exhibited smaller fluctuations and a more consistent distribution. Analysis of seasonal snowline changes from 2018 to 2023 revealed that the snowline increased from April to September and decreased from November to April."

    "abstract": "Hardware Trojan (HT) detection in integrated circuits including Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) faces significant challenges due to the scarcity and imbalance of high- quality side channel datasets. This paper addresses the above-mentioned challenge by employing Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (CWGANs) to generate synthetic side channel traces, specifically power signals, under both Trojan infected and Trojan free circuit conditions. The generated synthetic signals not only replicate real world side channel characteristics but also support scalable and costeffective model training. A Random Forest (RF) classifier trained on original power dataset achieves 93% accuracy, validating its effectiveness. When trained and tested solely on synthetic data, the models exhibit near perfect accuracy, confirming the realism and utility of the generated samples. However, evaluations reveal a domain shift when synthetic trained models are applied to real data, resulting in a reduced accuracy of 83.62%. To address this domain shift, we implement Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) adaptation techniques, which significantly improve crossdomain performance to 92.87%, nearly matching the baseline accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of generative models in hardware security and provide practical options for bridging the synthetic-to-real performance gap using advanced domain adaption techniques."

First, the target pursuit problem is modeled as an autonomous sensing and decision-making process of the RUAV, in which the state of the target is estimated by the radar and is utilized as the environmental information to plan the flight trajectory of the RUAV. Then, the utility function is designed utilizing the cumulative distance between the RUAV and the target plus the trajectory length in multiple predictive steps, and a dynamic optimization model with practical constraints is formulated on the basis of the model predictive control framework. The predatory search maneuvering target pursuit (PSMTP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the real-time path planning strategy while avoiding the forbidden region. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the PSMTP algorithm over some typical counterparts."

This study entailed ten experiments using SAR (Sentinel 1) and multispectral (Sentinel 2) datasets, applying background regression techniques and the random forest model. The findings that adding Sentinel 1 VV and VH (V = vertical, H = horizontal) polarizations, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values increased from 0.60 and 0.78 to 0.81, indicating a high level of precision in biomass estimates. This study also showed that the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE) 1 are the significant vegetation indices for producing a relationship with AGB. The GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the accuracy of AGB estimates, demonstrating their effectiveness in biomass assessment. The study brings into focus the use of satellite technology along with statistical models in the determination of the AGB in semi-arid regions and examines the impact of biomass equations in the determination of ecological health. The combination of SAR and multispectral data is regarded as a promising method for developing AGB estimations for better nature reserve management and subsequent conservation strategies. This work shows that AGB can be improved using more sophisticated technologies and models, thereby facilitating the sustainable use and protection of nature reserves."

    "abstract": "Unimodular waveform design with good integrated sidelobe level (ISL) is a key technique in MIMO radar systems. The problem is formulated as a complex quartic problem under constant modulus constraint (CMC), and in the existing methods, two issues that need to be further addressed: (1) the designed waveforms lack spectral compatibility, (2) performance degradation due to relaxation-induced errors. To address these issues, we propose a spectrally compatible waveform design method without relaxation. In general, spectral notches are formed at the stop band to enhance the spectral compatibility of the waveform, and we note that the energy spectral distribution (ESD) at the notch can be constructed as the inequality constraint to be numerically control, which facilitates to make a better trade-off with ISL performance. Furthermore, utilizing the property that complex circle manifold naturally satisfies CMC, the resulting problem can be projected as an unconstrained problem on that space, avoiding relaxation. Based on the above considerations, a non-relaxation penalty Riemannian manifold (PRM) method is proposed. Firstly, the multiple inequality spectral constraints are converted into an precise penalty term by an exact penalty mechanism and incorporated into the objective function. Subsequently, the CMC is satisfied by constructing a Riemannian manifold space, allowing the resultant problem to be projected as an unconstrained one onto this space. Finally, the spectrally compatible waveforms are obtained by a derived manifold-based conjugate gradient algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in ISL, while achieving a precise numerical control over multiple spectral notches."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images provide rich spatial-spectral information, enabling detailed analysis of remotely sensed images. This article presents a novel ultra-lightweight deep neural net model for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by introducing a patch-based attention mechanism along with a Restricted Isometric Regularization (RIR). The patch attention mechanism is embedded onto a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and operates on fixed spatial neighborhoods to dynamically weigh the local spatial-spectral features, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture intricate patterns across spectral bands. Due to the presence of a large number of bands in HSI images, preservation of intrinsic structure is a challenge. The present article formulates a novel regularizer, RIR, which facilitates stable feature projection in high-dimensional spaces and effectively addresses the curse of dimensionality while preserving the overall structure of the image. The proposed method achieves 99.79% accuracy on Pavia University dataset, setting a new benchmark in HSI classification. It also performs excellently on other benchmark datasets, e.g. 98.63% OA and 98.44% Kappa on Indian Pines, 99.94% OA and 99.93% Kappa on Salinas, and 99.54% OA and 99.50% Kappa on Botswana. In addition, ablation studies highlight the importance of each mechanism. With only 33,337 parameters, our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin."

However, under incomplete information, it is challenging to find the strategic equilibrium in an electricity market with multiple participants, due to the complex coupling and strategic bidding interactions among different types of market participants. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO)-based bidding method for competitive electricity markets to achieve a strategic equilibrium for the new type market participants, in which the action probability and policy space are further calculated. In this method, a centralized training framework is applied to handle the dynamic environment resulting from multi-agent interactions, and PPO is used to model the high-dimensional continuous action space in electricity market bidding. The proposed method has been tested and validated through simulations on the IEEE 30-bus system, which features various types of market participants. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve a strategic equilibrium for the bidding rewards among multiple market participants in an incomplete-information game setting."

It is applied to a 3-phase 12-slot 10-pole interior permanent magnet synchronous machine for twowheeler traction applications. Two grades of electrical steel, M250-35A and NO20-1200, are considered. The mechanical stress in the stator back iron is derived by FEA simulations and an average value is identified. Material magnetic properties are measured using a single sheet tester using EDM and laser cut samples. Data under compression load and laser cut damage are reported, including BH curves and derived iron loss model parameters. The grade NO20 is more influenced than M250-35A by compressive stress and laser cut. As expected, low flux densities and low frequencies are the most impacted (hysteresis loss). The stator iron losses are calculated with and without stress from shrink-fitting and cut edge damage. The stator iron loss build factors are presented on the torque-speed plane. The stator iron loss in the e-machine at low loads are considerably increased across the frequency range, while the efficiency is impacted the most at low load and 700 Hz. The WMTC drive cycle efficiency, with the M250-35A results in a drop of 0.8% and 0.9% for NO20-1200. However, no significant impact on the peak performance is predicted. The presented method estimates the impact of cut edge and shrink-fit effect on e-machine performance without increase in the simulation time, therefore it is optimal for initial selection of electrical steel grade."

Given the importance of water in any form, its overwhelming presence: causing floods and underwhelming presence: causing draught, can be problematic. Hence it becomes important to monitor water levels in commonly found water bodies and remotely located glacial lakes. In urbanized cities, an increase in water level of any water body may cause flood like situation, while GLOFs in case of Traditional water level sensors are generally mounted on permanent structure in open environment. Here, weather conditions such as moisture, temperature and humidity affect the sensor and sensor may deteriorate over time resulting in poor performance. In case of satellite imagery or airborne data, processing causes delay, developing latency between collection and processing of the data. Hence development of a system which can be used for prolonged period of time in real time to monitor the water level has become essential. The proposed buoy system solves both physical limitations of existing monitoring systems and existing latency in data transmission. The proposed system is composed of hermetic container which will contain the components of hardware and uses CEP (Complex event processing) using Apache Flink for real time data processing with LoRa WAN. Our proposed system can be employed for disaster situation like GLOFs and can prove to be helpful in that case."

    "abstract": "The technology for implementing stacked bus planes in half-bridge power modules is the most prominent solution for enabling high current capability and minimizing switching noise. A significant increase in stray inductance is observed in the commutation path with the use of two parallel coplanar busbars, leading to severe voltage overshoots and ringing during turn-off switching transients. This paper presents three bus plane configurations that characterize and optimize the design of a two-layer bus plane for SiC power modules. All prototypes are constructed by stacking the drain and ground plates with a Kapton sheet placed in between to provide insulation. An energy-based method is performed to mathematically estimate the potential stray inductance of a bus plane or busbar design. A comprehensive investigation into the common direct measurement methods for low impedance characteristic and connection setups incorporating a test fixture is undertaken to identify an appropriate empirical methodology for stray inductance measurements. The measured stray inductance of the proposed design is 22.2 nH, which is improved by 33 % compared to the minimal plane design. The proposed bus plane, with its heavily overlapping design and the shortest terminals, is validated to achieve a significant decrease in stray inductance and maximize magnetic flux cancellation."

A study on training noise was performed using (1) spatial-domain Gaussian noise and (2) frequency-domain noise. Spatial-domain noise generates artifacts that is shown to impair performance for some bitstream lengths. Frequency-domain noise training more accurately replicates realworld aberrations, and is show to be successful. Datasets with higher noise levels showed persistent convergence but decreased accuracy.

Despite significant advancements in the field, challenges such as inaccurate boundary prediction remain, often leading to misclassification of target regions. In this study, we propose an improved semantic segmentation model, SegNeXt-ENVC, which integrates the SegNeXt backbone with a U-shaped architecture. To capture complementary information from edge and deep features, we introduce an edge-enhanced model that incorporates the Visual State Space (VSS) module with channel attention and the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) method. This approach improves the processing of boundary information. Additionally, we enhance the upsampling process by integrating the VSS block with bilinear interpolation, further refining model performance. Using SegNeXt as the baseline, we evaluate our method on the LRBS and WHDLD datasets. On the complex land cover of large river basins, the model achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with a 1.39% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). These experimental results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed structure."

However, the scarcity of repeat measurements means temporal resolution is low. Stationary radar systems used for generating time series data are limited in the number of antenna elements they can support due to the radio frequency (RF) hardware that is typically used. This results in images with poor azimuth resolution, limiting the ability to infer structural changes within the glacier. To overcome this limitation, we integrate radio frequency over fiber (RFoF) hardware into existing radar systems with the goal of constructing and deploying large multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays that can be used for high-resolution timelapse imaging of a glacier’s internal structure."

While deep learning methods have improved upon traditional iterative optimization approaches, they struggle with robustness when processing real-world data that differs from training samples—particularly in terms of building spatial distributions and noise conditions. These challenges can result in degraded spatial features and increased residual clutter, yet this issue remains understudied. To address it, we explore equivariance—a property ensuring that transformations in input data lead to predictable corresponding transformations in output. In urban scenes, buildings appear as prominent components with diverse shapes, lines, and orientations. Additionally, varying noise conditions affect signal scales. Without equivariance, methods may produce inconsistent results when processing these natural variations. By improving rotation and scale equivariance, the method’s robustness is improved. Technically, we propose a two-phase imaging approach. The first phase performs deep-unrolled light reconstruction for each pixel. The second phase uses a spatial feature-enhanced multi-scale equivariant convolutional neural network to enhance both spatial features and equivariance properties. Experiments on both simulated and measured data show that our proposed method achieves better robustness across different signal-to-noise ratios while better spatial feature retrieval compared to the mainstream deep learning-based reconstruction method."

This paper presents a universal IPT system that features a series-series LC resonant circuit and a novel control method that ensures uniform voltage gain across a wide range of magnetic coupling and load conditions. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on predefined operating frequencies or iterative frequency tracking, the proposed method automatically identifies the optimal operating frequency, allowing for faster initialization of the charging process. The system employs a communication-free parameter estimation technique that relies solely on primary-side measurements, thereby eliminating the need for secondary-side feedback. Moreover, the proposed method operates without prior knowledge of secondary-side parameters, even with nonidentical LC circuits, provided that both sides share the same resonance frequency, which can be standardized in future designs. The simulation results confirm that the proposed system outperforms traditional techniques, with the voltage gain remaining close to the theoretical value, and the frequency estimation accuracy exceeding 99.9% under varying coupling conditions. The approach can be easily integrated into existing EV charging infrastructure with minimal modification, offering a universal, cost-effective, and scalable solution for future wireless power transfer applications."

Although significant progress has been made with panoramic images, obtaining directionally aligned panoramic images is not always feasible in practical applications. Moreover, when the orientation of ground query images is unknown and the field of view (FoV) is limited, challenges arise due to large viewpoint differences and the lack of information in the ground query image. To address these issues, we propose VACLNet, a framework for limited FoV cross-view geo-localization based on view augmentation contrastive learning. Specifically, to reduce the disparities in FoV and viewpoints between ground and satellite images, we perform view augmentation through two forms. First, we mask the panoramic satellite images based on the limited FoV to create symmetric limited FoV satellite views. Second, we project the limited FoV ground images to a bird’s-eye view (BEV) perspective through geometric transformations. Next, we establish cross-view and intra-view contrastive learning to enhance the model’s robustness to the same scene location under different viewpoints and to improve the perception of surrounding scenes in limited FoV images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that VACLNet significantly outperforms existing methods in addressing the challenges of limited FoV with unknown orientation."

A Microsoft Kinect sensor captures 3D kinematic features (speed, stride length, joint angles), which are processed by machine learning models to authenticate users against pre-trained profiles. The system dynamically adapts to environmental variables (lighting, terrain) and mitigates gait variability (e.g., injuries) via confidence-based early stopping, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Privacy is maintained through encrypted data storage and processing. Evaluations reveal robust performance in controlled settings and scalability for high-security applications such as access control.

In recent years, terrain-aided navigation (TAN) has emerged as a widely used alternative, offering robustness in challenging conditions. TAN is particularly well-suited to grid-based filters, which can accurately handle the highly non-linear nature of the estimation problem. However, such methods are typically slow and computationally demanding. This paper introduces an efficient variant of the Lagrangian Grid-Based Filter (LGbF) for non-linear Bayesian state estimation, using spectral differentiation to accelerate the filter's time update step. Traditional LGbFs, though more stable than particle filters and much faster than standard Grid-Based Filters (GbF), still suffer from higher computational complexity. By reformulating the diffusion part of the time update as a heat equation and solving it using spectral differentiation, the proposed method achieves a large computational complexity reduction without noticeable loss of accuracy. The proposed method is validated on a synthetic example with known ground truth, as well as on real-world terrain-aided navigation dataset, demonstrating comparable accuracy and substantial speed-ups over the standard LGbF. The code and the dataset are published on GitHub."

Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed method explicitly quantifies the influence of disturbance and state-coupling by designing dedicated effect indicators and exploiting the beneficial aspects of nonlinear dynamics. Positive effects are harnessed, while negative effects are transformed into advantageous contributions, thereby delivering superior robustness, lower energy consumption, and improved response rapidity. Specifically, a fuzzy disturbance observer is developed to accurately estimate the disturbance factors, including both parametric/unmolded uncertainty and external disturbance. Effect indicators are introduced to characterize the positive and negative impacts of disturbance and coupling on the active suspension system, and these insights are incorporated into the design of a novel adaptive controller. In addition, biologically inspired nonlinear reference model is deliberately introduced to make use of favorable nonlinear stiffness and damping effects. Furthermore, Lyapunov’s theory is employed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the overall suspension system. Experimental validation demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves excellent transient performance and significant energy savings, with reductions of up to 80% or more."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy."

    "abstract": "Floods are among the deadliest natural disasters, threatening lives and infrastructure worldwide, and require rapid and accurate mapping for effective emergency response. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique is highly valuable because it operates independently of weather conditions and sunlight availability. However, flood segmentation in SAR imagery remains challenging due to speckle noise, diverse terrain characteristics, and uncertain labels in publicly available datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-attention ResUNet that integrates channel recalibration and spatial attention to capture complex floodwater patterns more effectively. Unlike conventional U-Net architectures that rely solely on encoder–decoder skip connections for feature extraction, the proposed dual-attention ResUNet incorporates both Squeeze-and-Excitation channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms at multiple encoder–decoder scales, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and spatial context understanding in noisy SAR data. For datasets such as SEN1FLOODS11, where labels often contain uncertain pixels, we design a masked Focal–Tversky loss guided by pixel-level validity masks. This approach enables the model to exclude unreliable labels while addressing severe class imbalance. Additionally, conventional VV and VH polarizations are complemented with engineered spectral indices—such as normalized difference, root mean square intensity, and polarimetric ratio—to better distinguish flooded regions from surrounding land areas. Experimental results on the SEN1FLOODS11 and S1GFloods datasets demonstrate that our model achieves 97.50% accuracy, 92.65% IoU, and 96.18% F1 score on S1GFloods. Ablation studies show that dual attention provides an 11.85% IoU improvement over the baseline ResUNet, while the masked Focal–Tversky loss yields a 15.16% gain compared to BCE–Dice. Further hyperparameter tuning of its α, β, and γ parameters improves boundary sensitivity, and robustness tests confirm stable performance under varying speckle noise conditions. Grad-CAM++–based interpretability analysis verifies that the model focuses on meaningful SAR backscatter patterns, enhancing its transparency and reliability. Overall, the proposed system establishes a new benchmark for SAR-based flood detection and provides a strong foundation for future developments in emergency management applications."

    "abstract": "We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infant behavior in the “mobile paradigm”. This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant’s crib) is connected to one of the infant’s limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that “connected” limb. This ability to detect a “sensorimotor contingency” is considered to be a oundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, shedding light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infant sensorimotor learning.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive neurological disorder that impairs motor control and coordination due to brain injury or abnormalities before, during, or shortly after birth. Although robotic gait training can improve overall gait patterns in CP, interventions targeting the ‘foot rockers’ motion, essential for stable weight transfer and effective push-off, have received limited attention. In this study, five adults with CP were recruited to train on a robotic treadmill system in which controlled downward forces were applied to the pelvis during walking, promoting implicit motor learning to develop an improved foot rockers strategy. Following this, during overground walking, participants received distinct real-time auditory cues at heel strike and push-off, providing self-awareness feedback to reinforce and maintain the foot rockers pattern acquired during treadmill training. Post-training analyses reported increased Tibialis Anterior activation during early stance, enhancing dorsiflexion and heel strike, and greater Soleus and Gastrocnemius engagement in late stance for stronger push-offs (p < 0.05). These functional gains were reflected in key spatiotemporal metrics: longer step length, greater toe clearance, a reduced stance percentage, and a shorter double stance time (p < 0.05). Participants also exhibited increased range of motion of the foot and increased knee and hip extension throughout stance, reflecting a more upright lower limb (p < 0.05). Survey responses confirmed that participants acknowledged the resistive treadmill training for strengthening their muscles and influencing their walking patterns, and reported that the auditory biofeedback enhanced their awareness of heel-to-toe contact. Participants emphasized the necessity of incorporating both interventions, highlighting its potential as a promising approach to improving foot rockers and overall gait pattern in adults with CP."

    "abstract": "Maritime channel modeling is crucial for designing robust nearshore communication systems, yet reliable models that account for the dynamic marine environment with varying sea waves, wind conditions, and vessel motions remain scarce. This article investigates land-to-ship maritime wireless channel characteristics at 5.8 GHz based upon an extensive measurement campaign, with concurrent hydrological and meteorological information collection. First, a novel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is proposed for dynamic marine environments. Then, we introduce the concept of sea-wave-induced fixed-point (SWIFT) fading, a peculiar phenomenon in maritime scenarios that captures the impact of sea surface fluctuations on received power. An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is propounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured data, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading is studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter performing well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in rough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini index and Rician <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized.

We first present deterministic formulations of the IDS and then extend them with risk-aware objectives using Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) under the normal distribution.We compare all the proposed models in terms of solution quality and computational performance metrics such as branch and bound nodes, CPU time in seconds, and MIPGaps in percentages of the best solutions obtained in one hour of CPU time limit compared to the lower bounds reported by the Gurobi solver. Thus, we highlight the trade-offs between deterministic and risk-based formulations. Our contribution also lies in emphasizing the importance of an IDS-based structure as a flexible framework for network design. Subsequently, we show how VaR and CVaR capture uncertainty in transmission distance costs while maintaining tractable deterministic reformulations. Next, we demonstrate empirically how the solutions obtained with the proposed deterministic models can be used as a warm start for the stochastic formulations, obtaining tight near-optimal solutions within a fraction of a second. Consequently, we further propose logic bender decomposition algorithms for the deterministic models to study the scalability of the proposed deterministic models that allows one to obtain high-quality near-optimal solutions that can also be used as a warm start for stochastic models. Our numerical results confirm that the proposed models and algorithms provide near optimal, and optimal solutions for most of the instances tested, and a flexible and stochastic design framework."

Domain Adaptation method, which uses labeled data from a high resource language like English solves this problem by transferring its knowledge to resource scarce languages. In this study, we propose an Auto-Encoder based Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL) with a Pivot Augmentation method for cross-lingual tasks in Indian languages. Traditional SCL leverage pivot features create a shared feature space across domains, but its effectiveness is limited by the availability of relevant pivot features. To solve this problem, we introduce two approaches Auto-Encoder based Structural Correspondence Learning with Pivot Augmentation (AE-SCL-PA) and Auto-Encoder based Structural Correspondence Learning with Pivot Augmentation and FastText embeddings (AE-SCL-PA-FT), which extends the pivot set through automatic translation and synonym expansion, specifically tailored for Indian languages. By utilizing bilingual embeddings, we mapped the non-pivot features into a shared space and predicted the augmented pivot features using an autoencoder architecture. Our method enhances the transferability of models between languages by aligning monolingual embedding spaces without the need for parallel corpora or bilingual dictionaries. Evaluating our approach for different combinations of domains with the Indian Languages Kannada and Telugu, we obtained a considerable improvement in all combinations. The proposed model provides an approach for identifying sentiments in any language without labeled data."

    "abstract": "Amplitude-only measurements have recently been proposed to avoid phase sensitivity issues in terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) in reflection mode. These methods, however, are typically applied to open-boundary setups and may fail in scenarios where the Fabry–Perot interference is weak or absent. Here, we show that phase information can be essential in the characterization of low-index materials, such as dielectric foams. We address this limitation by focusing on a grounded Fabry–Perot configuration (i.e., a reflective backplane geometry), which enhances spectral features and allows for full exploitation of both amplitude and phase information. To this end, two effective protocols are developed here to accurately determine the complex permittivity of dielectric materials by exploiting both the amplitude and the phase of THz-TDS measurements. The first method fits directly the physical parameters of established permittivity dispersion models describing the unknown material by minimizing the weighted Euclidean norms of the amplitude and phase errors. This convex fitting approach improves convergence stability, especially when interference fringes are weak. The second method first estimates the optimal real permittivity values from the phase measurements, and then the loss tangent from the amplitude measurements. These mathematical values are then fitted through a suitable permittivity model to ensure causality. Both techniques are tested against materials with different dielectric properties, highlighting the case scenarios in which phase measurements significantly improve the accuracy of material dielectric characterization."

    "abstract": "In the field of remote sensing self-supervised learning, the self-supervised learning paradigm based on masked image modeling (MIM) effectively promotes the learning of structural and contextual semantic information in images. However, the random masking strategies employed in past studies have not effectively utilized the distribution of semantic information within images. Furthermore, overly simple reconstruction tasks cannot effectively improve self-supervised learning performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a gradient-guided activation-aware autoencoder (GA-MAE). Specifically, this approach computes and captures the spatial spectral activation map (SSAM) with semantic distribution information during the process of backpropagation of spatial-spectral reconstruction loss in the pre-training phase, thereby enabling masking operations on similar visual patches with higher reconstruction loss. Additionally, we introduce an Activation-Aware Self-Attention mechanism (ASA) that adjusts the self-attention dependencies by utilizing the weight information of visual patches provided by SSAM. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets (Houston2013, Augsburg, and Berlin) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With only ten labeled training samples per class, the proposed method achieves anoverall accuracy (OA) of 91.24%, 84.69%, and 73.43% on the Houston2013, Augsburg, and Berlin datasets, respectively, indicating improvements of 1.09%, 2.05%, and 2.40% over state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "This work proposes an optimal pricing scheme– OPUS– for UAV-as-a-Service (UaaS) using a bargaining game. In a UaaS platform, multiple actors participate– end-users request services, UAV owners lease their UAVs, and a centralized service provider allocates UAVs equipped with heterogeneous onboard sensors. A UAV can support multiple applications by moving across task locations, where both its mobility and the operations of its onboard sensors contribute to overall energy consumption. Consequently, energy use directly affects the price charged to end-users. On the other hand, the service provider aims to maximize revenue, while end-users seek to pay a minimum chargeable price without compromising the service quality. Thus, the challenge is to design an efficient pricing mechanism that balances these conflicting objectives. Therefore, in this work, we aim to design a pricing scheme, OPUS, capable of determining an optimal chargeable price by jointly considering energy consumption, time of use, resource utilization, and UAV reputation. Specifically, time-based pricing accounts for the duration of UAV engagement, resource-based pricing captures operational overheads such as transmission and storage, and reputation-based pricing reflects UAV reliability and past performance. We formulate the problem using the Rubinstein bargaining model to ensure a fair trade off between the service provider's profit and the end-user's satisfaction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OPUS outperforms existing schemes– QUEST, TMSC, and Yu's strategy– for UaaS. Specifically, OPUS improves service provider profit by an average of 33.7%."

To overcome this challenge, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is introduced to establish a controllable sensing link that bypasses the obstacle. Furthermore, a robust extended Kalman filtering (R-EKF) strategy with a sensing-failure fallback mechanism is developed to achieve reliable Warden tracking, where sensing failures are detected and promptly addressed through re-scanning of the Warden. In addition, a high-capacity covert optimization (HCO) scheme is proposed to improve the covert transmission performance and maintain reliable Warden tracking, which is achieved by the joint design of ISAC sensing-communication beamforming and RIS passive beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC-ISAC system achieves superior robustness and covert transmission performance compared with the no-RIS baseline and the element-wise optimization baseline."

First, to improve the model generalization capability under varying operating conditions, a leave-one-domain-out model-agnostic meta-learning (LODO-MAML) strategy is designed to learn the initialization parameters that can quickly adapt to varying operating conditions. Based on this, a training strategy combining MKMMD and contrastive learning is proposed to extract high-quality domain-invariant features. Furthermore, a capsule network classifier is constructed to decouple and classify the faults from the coupling relationship. Finally, the proposed method is verified through a comprehensive case study of two heterogeneous varying operating conditions datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method for generalization to unknown operating conditions and small sample scenarios."

Existing accelerator-generation tools, such as AMD’s FINN, do not adequately address extreme resource limitations faced by IoT endpoints operating in bare-metal environments without an operating system (OS). To overcome these constraints, we propose MARVEL–an automated, end-to-end framework that generates custom RISC-V ISA extensions tailored to specific DNN model classes, with a primary focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed method profiles high-level DNN representations in Python and generates an ISA-extended RISC-V core with associated compiler tools for efficient deployment. The flow leverages (1) Apache TVM for translating high-level Python-based DNN models into optimized C code, (2) Synopsys ASIP Designer for identifying compute-intensive kernels, modeling, and generating a custom RISC-V and (3) Xilinx Vivado for FPGA implementation. Beyond a model-class specific RISC-V, our approach produces an optimized bare-metal C implementation, eliminating the need for an OS or extensive software dependencies.

    "abstract": "In nighttime emergency rescue scenarios involving unmanned aerial vehicles, traditional artificial neural network (ANN)-based object detection algorithms are challenging to efficiently deploy on resource-constrained edge computing platforms due to their high computational complexity and energy consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNN), which emulate the brain’s information processing through sparse event-driven computations, significantly improve energy efficiency. Low-light and infrared images, as critical sources of information for nighttime rescue missions, can provide clear feature representations under low-light and complex environmental conditions. The efficient computational characteristics of SNN are highly compatible with the properties of these modalities, further enhancing their potential for nighttime emergency rescue tasks. For this emergency rescue scenario, this paper proposes a low-power object detection method for nighttime emergency rescue tasks, leveraging the fused characteristics of low-light and infrared imagery and the energy-efficient computational advantages of SNN. The method is based on Spiking-YOLO and was tested on self-constructed emergency rescue tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the ANN-based Tiny YOLO, the proposed method achieves theoretical power consumption reduced to 1/2000 of the original network, with performance metrics degradation not exceeding 2%."

The experiment was applied to a 2-DOF robotic manipulator under two excitation conditions. Identification Trajectory 1 (‘ID1’) comprises ten harmonic sinusoids and, while Trajectory 2 (‘ID2’) spans a wider frequency band. We quantify the fidelity of the static parameter estimation via the mean absolute error in nine basic inertial and friction parameters, and assess the precision of the dynamic torque prediction using RMSE and MAE in both the identification and the held test trajectories. Under limited excitation, WLS achieves the lowest parameter error and joint RMSE (0.1173 Nm), closely followed by OLS. Under rich excitation, OLS produces the most accurate parameter estimates, and RLS attains the lowest joint RMSE. These results demonstrate that increasing trajectory richness improves both static parameter recovery and dynamic torque prediction performance."

    "abstract": "The existing research on soil moisture (SM) estimation using ensemble learning often directly applies traditional models by constructing a multi-feature variable space and has shortcomings in aspects such as improvements of base models or ensemble strategies. To overcome this issue, by coupling our previously proposed enhanced generalized regression neural network (EGRNN) with stacking ensemble learning, we propose a novel ensemble learning based SM estimation method, termed EGRNN-Stack. Based on the Stacking ensemble learning framework, a primary learner set is constructed using GRNN, EGRNN, and random forest (RF), with EGRNN employed as the secondary learner, thereby proposing the EGRNN-Stack ensemble learning model for SM estimation. Experiments conducted on the QinghaiTibet Plateau during 2015 to 2016 demonstrated that: 1) EGRNN-Stack achieves the best estimation accuracy compared to other methods, with a low variance, indicating a better robustness of the method; 2) The deviations between the SM estimates from this model and the measured values are small, demonstrating its strong capability in fitting nonlinear data; 3) EGRNN-Stack can better reflect the temporal dynamics of SM in the Tibetan Plateau region; 4) The spatial distribution of soil moisture in the Tibetan Plateau overall presents a trend of \"more in the east and less in the west, more in the south and less in the north\". This work is performed using in-situ SM measurements and other ancillary data."

Utilizing the rich vegetation information from hyperspectral images (HSI), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are introduced for HSI feature extraction. To address the limitation of CNNs in capturing only local spectral features, a local-global spectral features (LGSF) extraction method is proposed. This method first transforms 1D spectra into 2D spectral images, and then extracts complementary local and global features that represent the spectral curves, fully exploiting the information between spectral bands. After convolution operations, the features are passed through a regression module for prediction. Based on Zhuhai-1 OHS data, the effectiveness of this method is validated using Hengqin New Area as a case study."

A total of 180 papaya images were collected from plantations in Mamuju Regency, South Sulawesi Province, consisting of 90 images depicting mealybug-infested specimens and 90 images of healthy, non-infested specimens. Image acquisition involved direct field observations and farmer interviews to differentiate infested and non-infested plants, with standardized imaging protocols applied to ensure consistency in distance, lighting, and orientation. The proposed system was evaluated at varying camera-to-target distances, with results indicating optimal detection performance at close range (10-20 cm), where accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score all achieved $100 \\%$. Performance decreased progressively with distance, with accuracy declining to 73% at 60 cm and reaching zero detection capability at $\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ c m}$, primarily due to reduced image resolution, increased background interference, and diminished illumination. The model training process, employing quantitative analysis techniques on the dataset, successfully adapted the classifier to the specific visual characteristics of mealybugs on papaya under real agricultural conditions. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach offers an efficient, real-time solution suitable for deployment on resourceconstrained devices, providing a practical tool to support pest management in papaya cultivation."

Rather than considering vegetation as a homogeneous entity, this study adopts a multifaceted approach by examining the frequency dependence of water content in leaves alongside the plant structure. This innovative method enables radar-based classification, providing insights into vegetation dynamics in relation to environmental factors. The SFCW radar, operating within the available measurement bandwidth of 0.8 GHz to 15 GHz, generates distinct frequency bands with a constant bandwidth of 4 GHz being a fundamental characteristic of all bands. The varying frequencies result in an enhancement of the influence of scattering and attenuation caused by the plants. Depending on the selected frequency band, different characteristics can be derived. Within the laboratory setting, the system is expanded to include an additional layer in which a target is buried. The combination of diverse frequencies enables the generation for characteristic surface maps of the vegetation."

    "abstract": "Injecting appropriate circulating currents can reduce the submodule capacitor voltage ripple in the modular multilevel converters (MMCs) and improve their internal performance. However, few studies have explored the impact of circulating current injection control (CCIC) on the system stability of grid-forming MMCs (GFM-MMCs), especially across a wide range of grid strengths. In this article, sequence impedance responses are modeled for stability analysis. A direct link is established between low-frequency oscillations and the negative damping region in the sequence impedance model. By applying CCIC based on instantaneous information, the sequence impedance of the MMC is reshaped, which reduces the negative damping region and enhances system stability. This behavior differs from its effect in grid-following MMCs (GFL-MMCs). However, the circulating current injected based on the output instantaneous is deterministic, which limits its ability to improve the system stability. To overcome this limitation, a power secondharmonic injection control (PSHIC) is proposed. By tuning the control coefficient, the stability margin can be further extended. The proposed impedance model and stability assessment are validated through simulations."

Therefore, diagnostic test generation methods have been proposed. The conventional methods generate additional test patterns which distinguish fault pairs that are not able to be distinguished using an initial test set with high fault coverage. However, since the number of additional diagnostic patterns is large, there is a problem that the size of the final test set becomes large. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method to replace test patterns which do not contribute much to improving diagnostic resolution with test patterns which improve diagnostic resolution while maintaining fault coverage using pseudo-Boolean optimization for stuck-at faults or transition faults. For stuck-at faults, experimental results for ISCAS'89 and ITC'99 benchmark circuits show that the number of additional diagnostic patterns was 10.3% on average. For transition faults, experimental results for ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the number of additional patterns was 18.0% on average."

Existing multi-view fusion methods usually implicitly hypothesize that the views of images are known, which restricts the applicable scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a semantic-view dual-branch feature embedding fusion network, which achieves flexible and accurate multi-view target recognition by utilizing prior view information. The model design mainly consists of three parts: 1) A dual-branch feature extraction module is constructed to extract the semantic features and view features of single-view images respectively. 2) A multi-view feature fusion module is built based on Transformer, which conducts embedding on the dual-branch feature maps and realizes multi-view feature fusion through the self-attention mechanism. 3) A multi-task learning loss function is designed to jointly optimize the tasks of single-view semantic classification, view classification, and multi-view semantic classification. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively enhance the accuracy and robustness of target recognition, and it enables end-to-end recognition of multi-view images with unknown views."

    "abstract": "Understanding the influence of climate variables—air temperature (AT), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), precipitation (PRC), and soil moisture (SM)—on global vegetation is essential for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate change. Among several vegetation descriptors, the Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) play complementary roles in assessing vegetation dynamics, thus warranting their investigation. NDVI, derived from optical reflectance data, quantifies vegetation greenness, providing insights into canopy density and biomass. However, it is prone to saturation in dense vegetation and atmospheric interferences, thus is better represented by kernel-NDVI (kNDVI). FPAR represents the proportion of incoming solar radiation absorbed by vegetation for photosynthesis, serving as a proxy for plant productivity and carbon assimilation efficiency. Analyzing kNDVI and FPAR, which exhibit distinct responses to climatic stressors, allows for a nuanced understanding of vegetation-climate interactions. As rising AT and VPD increase evaporative demand, reduced SM availability may impede vegetation productivity. Changes in precipitation significantly influence soil moisture, affecting the physiological functions of terrestrial ecosystems. Alterations in the long-term patterns of these climatic drivers can lead to shifts in ecosystem functioning and altered vegetation composition, impacting regional carbon and water cycles. Examining the spatiotemporal variability of these relationships across regions is crucial for predicting ecosystem resilience and enhancing the accuracy of land surface models. Analyzing vegetation descriptor trends alongside climate variables enhances the understanding of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics in the context of climate change, facilitating advancements in ecosystem conservation and sustainable resource management. This study examines the non-linear relationships between vegetation trends and climatic variables in both global and regional contexts.We acquired spatiotemporally consistent data regarding vegetation descriptors from GIMMS and climate variables from ERA5. After removing seasonal effects from the monthly time series of all variables through Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS (STL), we employed the Modified Mann-Kendall test and also computed Sen’s slope to assess their long-term trends. Subsequently, we employed the Maximal Information coefficient (MIC) to investigate the non-linear association between the magnitude of trends in climate variables and vegetation parameters. We noticed enhanced spatial patterns in photosynthetic efficiency than greening. Vegetation descriptors exhibit significant increases in South Asia, East Asia and Europe. Central and Southern parts of Africa also registered increased vegetation productivity and greenness. However, vegetation conditions have deteriorated in eastern Australia and southern South America. We found a significant increase in AT over northern extra-tropical areas. There is also a prominent decrease in SM in central Africa, central Europe, western North America, the southern part of Australia and South America. Over the same areas, VPD trends show significant increments. Using MIC, we found that the global trend in photosynthetic efficiency is more sensitive to long-term temporal patterns in VPD than the rest of the climate variables, contrary to vegetation greenness, which shows a stronger association with PRC trends. While FPAR shows a greater association with VPD and PRC in the tropics, greening shows a more substantial relation with the same variables in the northern extra-tropics. PRC trend in the tropical and northern extra-tropical regions is the primary factor influencing vegetation descriptors, whereas AT trend exhibits equivalent importance in its association with vegetation descriptors over the southern extra-tropics. Our investigations also highlight regional contrasts in these intricate associations between trends in vegetation and climate conditions. Inferences from this study will be obligatory for further region-specific analysis of climate-vegetation interactions in various aspects of climate change, adaptation, and ecosystem conservation management practices."

Embedding trajectories are assembled considering the two principal components of each embedding from an image series, resulting in sequences of points in the plane. Considering time series from different cases of integrated systems, embedding trajectories are presented and the patterns for each case are analysed in terms of visual inspection and Euclidean distance based metrics, suggesting that the framework shows potential to be further explored in classification systems."

    "abstract": "The encoder-decoder framework is widely used in existing remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) models, with the introduction of attention mechanisms yielding significant results. However, current attention-based captioning models only establish relationships between local features, without considering their relationship with global features. This limitation leads to the generation of descriptive sentences that are weakly correlated with the image scene. To address this, we propose a Multi-Level Feature and Dual-Keys Attention (MFDKA) mechanism. Specifically, in the encoder, both local and global features of the image are extracted. Then, the attention mechanism is used to fuse the global and local features, while an attention gate is employed to filter out redundant feature components from the fused image features. In the decoder, inspired by GLU, we introduce a novel attention block, the Dual-Keys attention block, which improves the effectiveness and accuracy of caption generation by generating \"related values\" and reverse keys. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches."

    "abstract": "The Campi Flegrei caldera is an active volcano located in southern Italy that, over the last two decades, was affected by a phase of progressively rising uplift accompanied by increasing seismicity and geochemical anomalies. The ground displacement pattern, which is monitored through GNSS and Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR), is mainly radial with a maximum uplift in the area corresponding to Rione Terra (Pozzuoli). Recently, we have identified a geodetic anomaly in the uplift displacement pattern, near the Mt. Olibano–Accademia area, where most of the recent seismicity of the caldera is concentrated. In particular, the area affected by the detected anomaly experiences a reduced uplift with respect to the surrounding region. This anomaly, which is analyzed by exploiting the DInSAR measurements of several spaceborne SAR systems operating at different frequencies, becomes clearly recognizable starting from 2021 and represents a potentially critical area for the caldera dynamics and related hazard understanding."

Our framework employs an iterative process that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle (user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and based on the oracle’s responses, change detection model is dynamically updated. The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work."

The research method used is System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with an iterative development model. The results of this study show that the Wireless BadUSB device succeeded in automating attacks on the Windows 11 operating system connected to the internet by using a local administrator account and successfully obtaining information about the Windows system, Wi-Fi credentials, and successfully turning off windows defender. In addition, this research also managed to steal passwords from all browsers used and take Instagram cookies on the Google Chrome browser to avoid Multi Factor Authentication (MFA). The attack ended with the deletion of windows run history, powershell history, and chrome extensions.

To better handle the extracted features, an Information Modeling Enhancement Module (IMEM) is also incorporated. This module filters out redundant information, enabling the model to focus on key information and further improving the recognition performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models on three public datasets, thereby validating its effectiveness."

Such a solution not only potentially offers global scalability, but can act as an intelligent data prioritization step, as only HSI containing methane can be transmitted for further analysis. Our experimental study performed over the STARCOP dataset demonstrated that the suggested pipeline can precisely detect methane in a limited number of spectral bands."

In this paper, we propose Temporal U-KAN, the first application of the U-KAN network to the cloud removal task. Our method introduces pseudo-temporal modeling to simulate the dynamic process of cloud evolution over time. By embedding a time variable to capture the dynamic changes of clouds and integrating KAN layers, we explore the potential of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in cloud removal tasks. We compare Temporal U-KAN with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in cloud removal, particularly in significantly reducing parameter count and training time."

While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is prominent for such tasks, its internal parameters are often chosen without a systematic investigation, potentially leading to suboptimal results. This study addresses this gap by designing several experimental scenarios to carry out a systematic sensitivity analysis of several key PSO parameters, which include population size, number of iterations, inertia weight, and acceleration coefficients, for SVM hyperparameter tuning using UDIAT ultrasound breast cancer dataset. We implemented a multi-objective PSO using a weighted-sum fitness function to optimize for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that a moderate configuration of $\\mathbf{5 0}$ particles and 50 iterations provides the best balance between the performance model and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that a balanced inertia weight ($\\boldsymbol{w}=\\mathbf{0. 5}$) and balanced acceleration coefficients ($c_{1}=1.5, c_{2}=1.5$) are crucial for effective convergence. These findings provide useful insights for future research into how to configure PSO parameters more efficiently in the medical image classification."

To improve data processing efficiency and reduce storage burden, the simultaneous transmission of multiple PRF signals was replaced with time-division transmission mode. The proposed algorithm was validated using TD-multi-PRF passive bistatic radar simulation experiment and performs well. The average optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) range in the simulation experiment is 0.3269."

Furthermore, the proposed CPFRM is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize average torque while minimizing torque ripple. Performance enhancements over conventional motors are analyzed using finite element analysis (FEA) under no-load, full-load, and overload conditions. FEA results validate the superiority of the proposed motor, showing a 33.3% and 7.1% increase in full-load torque compared to fluxswitching and flux-reversal PM motors, respectively.

Snow after this date is classified as wet snow, effectively improving the accuracy of wet snow detection. Validation against ground-based observations demonstrates that the overall accuracy the overall accuracy of wet snow detection reached 0.79, effectively addressing the underestimation of wet snow areas caused by backscatter threshold-based methods.

    "abstract": "Information about buildings and building change is essential for many practical applications, especially for humanitarian emergency response in temporary settlement areas hosting forcibly displaced people. In a classical building change detection approach, pairs of pre- and post-images and corresponding annotations indicating building change are required. This approach has two critical limitations. First, it is inefficient in time-sensitive applications like emergency response to create annotations, which is constrained by the availability of post- and pre-event images and is hard to create sufficient annotations in a limited response time. Second, even under normal circumstances, changed objects could be rare and getting sufficient change examples to train a change detection model is a challenging task. We followed a generative approach to generate synthetic bi-temporal images from a single-time image to train a change detection model. Our results show that the generative models employed managed to generate bi-temporal images with structural and style similarity. A change detection model trained on the generated synthetic dataset has achieved a mAP ranging from 4.7% to 42.6% without accessing real bi-temporal building change annotations."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the rapid prototyping of an analog spiking neuron for MNIST classification using hardware-in-the-loop to construct a convolution neural network (CNN). The neuron is implemented as a voltage-mode neuron using an op amp to perform time-domain integration of the synaptic inputs. The synapse is realized with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that modulates the input voltage spike magnitude by the synaptic weight. A switched-capacitor bank implements the feedback capacitor allowing a tunable constant of integration. A time-multiplexed approach emulates a fully parallel convolution neural network (CNN). The system employs commercial off-theshelf components (COTS) to realize the neuron design, making it suitable for rapid, low-cost prototyping prior to full-scale integrated circuit (IC) implementation."

However, due to the complex backgrounds and redundant spatial-spectral information in hyperspectral images, anomaly detection still faces challenges in feature extraction and processing efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient hyperspectral anomaly detection method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). First, a croase detection is performed to identify widely distributed background pixels. The background pixels selected are then used as training samples for the GAN model. Upon generating the background, the RX detector is employed to identify anomalies by analyzing the residuals between the original image and the generated background. Furthermore, a parallel optimization strategy for the GAN framework is introduced, substantially reducing data processing time. Experimental results on hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."

However, existing attention-based captioning models primarily focus on relationships between local features, failing to effectively integrate global features and highlight salient regions, thus hindering the generation of accurate scene descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose the Detail-Global Saliency-guided Multi-scale Transformer Model (DGSM-TM), which combines a dual-branch encoder with a multi-scale decoder framework. In the encoding stage, saliency maps are generated via a pixel-level saliency assessment task, and a Detail-Global Saliency-guided Fusion Module (DGSFM) is introduced to merge global and detailed features, significantly enhancing the representation of critical regions. In the decoding stage, a Multi-head Dilation Cross-Attention (MDCA) mechanism is employed to effectively capture relationships between local and global features through multi-scale attention, generating more precise descriptive sentences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DGSM-TM model achieves superior performance on the UCM-Captions and RSICD datasets."

While the instrument’s primary application is on PBL’s thermodynamic sounding, it also offers an opportunity to improve water cloud and precipitation retrievals with better spectral constraints. The shapes of liquid waterdrops in water clouds and precipitation are mostly spherical, to which the Mie solution is applicable to solve for their electromagnetic scattering. The essential variable of Mie solutions is mkd (or equivalently mkr), where m is the complex refractive index of water, k = 2π/λ the angular wavenumber, and d (r) the diameter (radius) of the waterdrop. Consequently, spherical waterdrops’ single-scattering properties, e.g., extinction and scattering efficiencies Q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e</inf> and Q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</inf>, are functions of mkd alone. This provides a convenient pathway to parameterize water-drop single-scattering properties across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the numerical Mie solution depends indeed only on mkd. We then present our attempt to parameterize extinction efficiency across the microwave spectrum 6-250 GHz and across drop radius."

In conventional open-loop systems, even a slight variation in mutual inductance between the transmitter pad (TP) and receiver pad (RP) can cause excessive current flow, leading to increased power loss and reduced efficiency. To address this, the proposed control system continuously monitors mutual inductance by extracting phase and amplitude information from voltage and current signals. Using this data, the system dynamically adjusts the gate signals to optimize current regulation and minimize switching and conduction losses. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through analytical analysis and simulation results for a 3.3 kW IPT system."

Vessel-DINO consists of three main parts: multimodal information extraction and alignment via ViT-based pretrained foundation models, multi-scale fusion and feature embedding, and a DINO-like detection head. In addition, we introduce a new dataset, Vessel-10k, including 12210 images, partly collected from existing well-known datasets. Extensive experiments on Vessel-10k demonstrate that Vessel-DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its potential for advancing maritime vessel detection."

This bridge had a 20 cm bump accident in the past due to steel rods (tensile members) breakage at the girder edge. This report includes the following two analysis results utilizing the measurement data collected over six years, including the accident date: 1. Accuracy evaluation of InSAR displacement by comparing it with an in-situ measured data of the bridge after the accident, 2. Identification of the behavior change timing at which the steel rods failed. In the analysis, deformation modeling based on an extended PSI method is applied to efficiently extract the structural displacement from the limited reflection points on the bridge. In addition, a change detection method that focuses on anomalous deformation, excluding thermal-expansion displacement, is proposed to identify the behavior change timing. As a result, the following were revealed: 1. High consistency was confirmed between the InSAR displacement and the actual measured data. 2. The center of the span moved downward and the girder edge moved upward, which are thought to be the result of the steel rods degradation. 3. As the result of behavior change detection, it was found that the deformation velocity had increased by about five times at both the center and the edge from about one year before the accident, and the timing of the change, which is considered to be the steel rods breakage, was detected."

    "abstract": "Plant species recognition is critical in various research domains. In recent years, deep learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved notable success in this task. Studies have shown that integrating hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with hybrid 3D-2D CNN classifiers can significantly improve recognition accuracy. However, CNN performance may degrade when training data are insufficient, primarily due to limited sample diversity. In addition, the high spectral redundancy of HSI, where adjacent bands carry similar information, can further reduce classification accuracy. To address this issue, this study proposes an Enhanced Hybrid CNN (EH-CNN) for highaccuracy plant canopy image classification. The EH-CNN incorporates optimization strategies such as factorized 3D convolution, multilevel feature fusion, and residual blocks to improve feature learning efficiency. The experiment was conducted on a hyperspectral canopy image dataset comprising 140 plant species. To validate the feature learning capability of the EH-CNN, Class Activation Mapping (CAM) visualization was employed for comparison with a reference model. Experimental results demonstrate that the EH-CNN significantly outperforms the baseline model, achieving up to 98% accuracy. CAM results confirm that the EH-CNN effectively captures critical features necessary for distinguishing plant species."

We compare several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Our analysis reveals that traditional metrics, such as IoU and F1-score may fail to capture important qualitative differences between methods, particularly in their ability to separate adjacent parcels. Consequently, we adopt Hoover metrics to provide more nuanced insights into model performance by categorizing instance detection outcomes. This approach offers a pathway to transition from overall area-based metrics to instance-level analysis for agricultural parcel assessment."

    "abstract": "Tomographic synthetic aperture radar (tomoSAR) enables effective 3D mapping of urban buildings. Recently, researchers have leveraged data-driven deep learning for tomoSAR imaging to extract scene priors. Most current research focuses on supervised learning using deep unrolling, with training data generated through physical model-based simulated measurements. However, the simulated training data may not accurately represent real-world conditions. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore alternative approaches that can leverage deep learning’s capabilities in an unsupervised manner. In this context, we propose a generative approach using self-supervised learning for tomoSAR imaging. Unlike conventional frameworks, this self-supervised approach decouples the system measurement process from simulation while enabling the extraction of scene priors, particularly spatial features. Technically, we introduce a one-step self-supervised deep generative model for intra-slice prior extraction and cascaded modules of U-Net and LSTM model for inter-slice prior extraction, working together for multidimensional imaging. These modules are integrated into a multi-task optimization problem for complete tomoSAR reconstruction, incorporating the physical measurement model. The corresponding solution method is derived using the proximal gradient algorithm. Experiments on both simulated and measured data show that our proposed method achieves better reconstruction quality in terms of spatial features, effectively harnessing deep learning in a self-supervised manner, just as existing supervised approaches have done."

Experimental results demonstrate that DDIM with ASC constraints can produce more realistic aircraft samples than the baseline."

    "abstract": "Error protection schemes (e.g., Error Correction Codes (ECCs)) must be implemented for memories in safety-critical applications to guarantee a dependable system operation. However, for hardware-constrained systems at the nanoscale, the maj or challenge of employing ECCs is to meet the requirements of both dependability and hardware efficiency. A solution is to further consider the specific protection requirements of different systems, rather than developing only generic ECCs. For example, for some applications like machine learning, data tends to have different importance and only errors on some critical bits can degrade performance. In this paper, an approximate protection scheme using codes derived from original Single Error Correction-Double Adjacent Error Detection (SEC-DAED) codes is proposed. The proposed codes expand the correction capability for several critical bits under DAEs (the most frequent error pattern for memories with advanced technology), while keeping the number of parity bits and decoding complexity unchanged. The design of such codes is established to achieve the maximum number of critical bits that can be protected; examples for protecting 16- and 32-bit memories are provided to verify the theoretically supported number of critical bits (6 and 20 bits respectively). Moreover, compared to existing ECCs with similar protection capability, the proposed codes incur the smallest memory redundancy and lower (or similar) encoder/decoder overhead as per synthesis results. Finally, a case study for protecting the parameter memory of neural networks is presented; results show that although protecting only some critical bits under DAEs, the model with the proposed scheme achieves the same accuracy as in the error-free case."

Machine learning models such as partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and a novel Density-Aware Neural Network (DANN) were evaluated. DANN achieved the best performance on FD data, with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.872, RMSE = 1.362, and RPD = 2.795.

To address this issue, this study proposes a real-time tracking system that integrates a GPS device and SOS button with Kafka middleware and a backend server to enhance emergency response. The system consists of five main components: SOS button, GPS with TCP client, Kafka, backend with RESTful APIs, and a live dashboard. These components work together to collect, transmit, and visualize emergency and tracking data. Experimental testing shows that the backend can process continuous location updates and SOS alerts reliably, while the dashboard provides clear and responsive monitoring.

    "abstract": "Accurate cloud property retrieval is vital for understanding cloud behavior and its impact on climate, including applications in weather forecasting, climate modeling, and estimating Earth’s radiation balance. The Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA), a widely used physics-based approach, simplifies radiative transfer calculations by assuming each pixel is independent of its neighbors. While computationally efficient, IPA has significant limitations, such as inaccuracies from 3D radiative effects, errors at cloud edges, and ineffectiveness for overlapping or heterogeneous cloud fields. Recent AI/ML-based deep learning models have improved retrieval accuracy by leveraging spatial relationships across pixels. However, these models are often memory-intensive, retrieve only a single cloud property, or struggle with joint property retrievals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CloudUNet with Attention Module (CAM), a compact UNet-based model that employs attention mechanisms to reduce errors in thick, overlapping cloud regions and a specialized loss function for joint retrieval of Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) and Cloud Effective Radius (CER). Experiments on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) dataset show that our CAM model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods, reducing mean absolute errors (MAE) by 34% for COT and 42% for CER, and achieving 76% and 86% lower MAE for COT and CER retrievals compared to the IPA method."

In this study, we planned to further explore the extent to which the snow radar was able to image an ice shelf. A 6 km line on the McMurdo Ice Shelf was surveyed by the snow radar mounted on a sledge and compared with data from a 400 MHz ground penetrating radar. Comparing the radargrams from both radars, we found good agreement in the observation of a brine layer at depths of up to 15 m. In addition, we observed that the snow radar was more effective in detecting finer features, like near surface buried large-scale undulations and the cross-cutting of numerous stratigraphic horizons of fresh ice by the brine layer."

This study presents a novel precision agriculture crop recommendation model for farmers based on multiple parameters. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is proposed and enhanced with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, a first in crop recommendation systems. The model utilizes a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based adjacency matrix to construct a farming graph based on the similarity of environmental factors. Our approach analyzes critical soil properties such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and pH, as well as weather data, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall from various regions in India, to recommend the most suitable crops for different conditions. The inclusion of KAN layers enhances the model’s ability to capture complex relationships between soil, climate, and crop types. The proposed GKANs-KNN model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a remarkable recommendation accuracy of 98%, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art models. This innovative integration of GCN, KAN, and KNN offers a highly reliable and efficient solution for precision agriculture, with the potential to improve crop recommendation and resource management."

To solve this problem, a novel range ambiguous clutter suppression method for SBSR based on Intra-pulse superimposed stepped frequency (ISSF) design and space time adaptive processing (STAP) is proposed in this paper. By transmitting series of stepped frequency signals simultaneously during a pulse period, ISSF introduces an extra dimension which is related to slant range and called the slant range domain here for echo. Then digital beam forming (DBF) can be utilized in the slant range domain to form nulls where range ambiguous components locate and suppress the relative range ambiguous clutter. After that, STAP is performed to suppress the unambiguous clutter. Besides, the method of constrain and design on system parameters for SBSR is also discussed to avoid grating lobes in the slant range domain. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ISSF-STAP."

    "abstract": "Grid-connected system stability is frequently compromised by dynamic interactions between inverters and the grid. Conventional active dampers-typically employed to mitigate such stability issues-exhibit delayed responses to emerging oscillations and rely on fixed parameter settings that lead to excessive power loss. To address the inherent latency and fixed-parameter limitations of conventional active dampers, this paper proposes a novel active damper employing a preoscillation stabilization framework. This framework uniquely integrates real-time impedance-based stability assessment with adaptive virtual resistance control. The core novelty lies in its ability to continuously monitor system impedance characteristics and trigger adaptive damping measures as the system approaches predefined stability margin thresholds, rather than reacting to existing oscillations. This preemptive approach, combined with a closed-loop virtual resistor regulator that precisely maintains critical stability margins, significantly enhances adaptability to grid impedance variations and improves power quality compared to conventional delayedresponse active dampers. The operational effectiveness and robustness of the proposed active damper are validated through detailed time-domain simulations."

    "abstract": "A significant increase in the switching frequency of silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors can be achieved through soft-switching techniques such as Zero-Loss Switching (ZLS). ZLS consists of two complementary techniques: ZeroVoltage Switching (ZVS) turn-on and a fast turn-off with no current through the MOSFET channel. Thus, the size and cost of the passive components in the converter can be reduced. However, even under ZLS, some residual loss persists, due to the charge transfer within the devices' parasitic capacitances. In this work, a calorimetric method is presented to measure this power loss, supported by a rigorous uncertainty analysis that provides precise and reliable results even at very low power dissipation levels. Experimental tests show that switching loss under ZLS condition can be up to two orders of magnitude lower than under hard-switching. However, this loss should not be systematically neglected, as it limits the maximum achievable switching frequency. Furthermore, they are found to increase with both switched voltage and current, consistent with a resistive-like behavior linked to the parasitic capacitances. Hence, the proposed methodology forms a solid basis for accurately characterizing ZLS residual loss."

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) is a key research area in remote sensing. With advances in imaging techniques, cross-domain CD (CDCD), between optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has gained significant attention. However, CDCD is challenging due to their differing modalities, which provide complementary information. Previous methods rely on transformation-based approaches involving two tasks: image translation (SAR to optical) and CD. Recent multitasking approaches reduce this gap but demand highly compute-intensive training due to complex generative models. Notably, remote-sensing foundation models (ReFM), built solely using remote-sensing data, remain underexplored for addressing this issue. We propose a novel deep-learning (DL) architecture, ReFUnet, which integrates a pre-trained ReFM with a locally trainable custom Siamese U-Net in a single network for change detection in optical and SAR images. The approach leverages generic embeddings from the extensively pre-trained ReFM alongside locally trained embeddings. This design aims for the reduction in training resource requirements. ReFUnet efficiently fuses these embeddings and employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-based CNN classifier to generate change maps. It outperforms current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. An ablation study further confirms KAN’s superiority over Multi-Layer Perceptrons in this architecture. ReFUnet sets a promising direction for the adaptation of ReFMs in cross-domain CD of optical and SAR images."

    "abstract": "Building change detection (BCD) in remote sensing images primarily involves using multi-temporal images of the same region to extract information about building changes. The development of data-driven deep learning has significantly advanced BCD. However, due to the slow frequency of building changes, it is challenging to obtain effective BCD data pairs, making it difficult to construct a class-balanced BCD dataset. This limitation severely restricts the performance improvement of BCD models. To address this issue, In this paper, a change mask-guided multi-temporal image pair generation (CMMG) is proposed, which utilizes the de-noising process to enlarge the latent representation space for multi-temporal image pair generation. To achieve this, first, a mask-guided building remote sensing image generation approach (MBG) based diffusion model is designed. This approach enables the controlled generation of building information while randomly generating non-building information. Second, a change-controllable multi-temporal background-diverse change detection image pair generation strategy (CDMG) is proposed. This strategy leverages a trained MBG and multi-temporal building masks whose changes can be controlled to generate diverse change detection image pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent generative capabilities, and the generated diverse and realistic change detection data significantly unleash the potential of plain change detection model, especially under conditions of limited training data."

Agile systems with selectable look direction and orbiting in mid-inclination orbits (MIO) provide an improved performance. Additionally, the use of single-pass multi-squinted StripMap acquisitions and the application of multi-squint techniques to long-dwell Spotlight collects shows high potential to reduce the number of necessary acquisition geometries from three to two.

These factors limit the efficiency and accuracy of detection, particularly for occluded targets. A local anomaly detection method based on supervoxel segmentation has been proposed for MPC data. The false alarm rate is reduced through supervoxel segmentation, and then a spherical model is used for localized background selection to minimize false alarms caused by background contamination from anomalies. Compared to applying advanced global anomaly detectors directly to MPCs, the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and is more capable of detecting occluded targets."

    "abstract": "As one of the most typical geometric attributes, the azimuth angle plays a crucial role in various tasks such as target classification and generation, particularly when dealing with limited samples. However, due to the scarcity of labeled data, the sensitivity of parameters, and the variability of imaging results, precise azimuth prediction of targets in remote sensing images remains a challenge. We attribute the possible causes to two factors: the lack of an efficient angular encoding module, and the insufficient awareness to samples with adjacent angles. Therefore, an end-to-end Angle Regression-based Class activation mapping-guided Network (AR-CAMN) is proposed, achieving precise target azimuth prediction. Firstly, an angle extraction module based on trigonometric functions is employed for efficient angular encoding and feature learning. Then, an angle regression-based class activation mapping module is designed to enhance the model’s awareness and sensibility to adjacent angles. By using the paired feature maps of CAM as explicit attention constraints, the proposed method effectively enhances the representation of continuity and consistency for adjacent angles. Experiments conducted on the optical and SAR images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which achieves an average reduction of 6.45° in angle prediction error compared with existing representative algorithms."

Next, a review of the EMI equivalent circuit of 3-Level inverters is conducted and completed for 3-L SNPC. An automated design methodology for EMI filters is then defined and applied to derive the optimal design that complies with standards while balancing the previously defined trade-offs. Finally, the contribution of the EMI filter in terms of price and footprint is added to the inverter performances, providing complete insights into the overall system. The analysis is conducted at various power levels to emphasize the importance of addressing EMI requirements when selecting the suitable topology, as this can reverse performance trends."

The proposed approach leverages CALIOP Level 1B data and Level 2 Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) products to develop a profile-scanning algorithm for retrieving the vertical structure of atmospheric features. Additionally, MERRA-2 reanalysis data and ICOADS observations are employed to analyze near-surface meteorological conditions (including relative humidity, temperature inversion, and wind speed) associated with sea fog events in the study region (15°N–60°N, 110°E–180°E). A seasonally adaptive detection algorithm is established to distinguish sea fog from other weather conditions (e.g., stratus clouds and stratus precipitation) by accounting for variations in atmospheric stability and boundary layer dynamics. ICOADS reports serve as ground truth for validation. The results demonstrate robust detection performance, with seasonal accuracy rates of 89.29% (spring), 92.86% (summer), 83.33% (autumn), and 92.31% (winter).

Through a comparison between grid-forming and grid-following control, it is shown that the passivity theory might be insufficient in assessing the risk for instability in grid-connected converter systems. Theoretical findings are validated via time-domain simulations."

Despite progress in natural image methods, existing approaches have failed to adequately account for the importance of object motion features and local spatial context in temporal relationship descriptions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for describing temporal relationships in remote sensing object groups by incorporating object motion features and employing a global-local spatial encoder combined with a temporal decoder structure. Compared to existing methods, this approach significantly improves feature extraction and context optimization, achieving excellent experimental results on our dataset OGTR."

Additionally, we adopted a detection transformer (DETR) framework as the detector, enabling the generation of oriented object queries and designing a network that effectively considers both local and global rotational characteristics of objects. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we trained the network on an open-source dataset including very-high-resolution (VHR) images for AOOD tasks. The results showed that the proposed method achieved superior region proposal accuracy and rotation angle estimation performance compared to other networks."

Specifically, we introduce geometric cost-volumes and convolutional gating units to refine the disparity while improving the recognition of geometric details. In addition, we construct an improved multi-scale cost-volume model using feature pyramids to accommodate the diversity of remote sensing image scales. To further improve the accuracy of disparity maps in critical regions, we design a gradient consistency loss function to explicitly guide its optimization.

To solve this problem, the cross-modal enhanced interactive Transformer (CEAT) is proposed for HSI and LiDAR joint classification. First, in order to enhance the representation ability of spatial-spectral and elevation features, heterogeneous feature enhancement module is designed to mine the position information in features. Then, the cross-modal interactive module is designed to facilitate information exchange between heterogeneous features and improve the position awareness, thereby forming a more comprehensive feature representation.

This integration optimizes spectrum utilization but restricts perception capabilities, particularly affecting the detection of pedestrians and moving vehicles in urban environments, while still ensuring communication quality. In this study, we propose a single-channel ISAC base station (BS) solution for detecting and identifying moving targets. Specifically, we develop a 2D FISTA-based target detection algorithm grounded in compressive sensing principles, designed to enhance the efficiency of sensing and accelerate detection speed. Our approach begins by modeling the sensing signals received at the BS and formulating a 2D signal model based on the range-Doppler spectrum. The model leverages the sparse distribution of targets in urban road environments, which are typical application scenarios for ISAC, and formulates optimization problems to reconstruct the positions and velocities of the targets. The proposed algorithm extracts moving targets in ISAC scenarios by efficiently solving the 2D range-velocity map reconstruction problem. Simulation results demonstrate the capability for high accuracy in moving target detection and velocity estimation under challenging conditions in a complex urban road environment."

The emerging method, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), effectively addresses these problems with its high quality image synthesis and low training overhead. Nevertheless, 3DGS faces performance degradation due to the challenges inherent in the space object 3D reconstruction such as strong light contrast, incomplete observation, weak texture, and so on. In this work, an analysis is conducted on the challenges and a suite of strategies has been proposed to address these challenges. We use image-wise adaptive floater suppression to avoid the drastic lighting variations and improved gaussian densification to strengthen the reconstruction of sparse textured areas. Compared with other methods, we can achieve more realistic rendering effects and complete geometric surfaces along with realistic images."

Instead of relying on precise localization of specific faults or root causes, Sentry directly identifies and offlines a set of edge servers related to failures to ensure service level objective (SLO) while minimizing QoE degradation. Sentry constructs a state graph based on real relay streams, combining temporal modeling and graph neural networks to effectively filter out short-term network fluctuations and transform the complex combinatorial optimization problem into an efficient node-level prediction task. The experimental results show that Sentry outperforms existing solutions in both success rate and cost of failure handling, demonstrating strong overall performance and deployment potential."

    "abstract": "Optical wireless communication (OWC) has been recognized as a promising solution for establishing high-speed, low-latency data connectivity between air and water. During the propagation of optical beams across dynamic water surfaces, random scattering and refraction can result in information leakage issues, significantly increasing the probability of an adversary listener (Willie) detecting the signal transmission. In this paper, we investigate the covert performance of bidirectional air-water cross-boundary OWC systems under the detection of arbitrary underwater/aerial Willie for the first time. To characterize the detection accuracy at Willie and communication quality between a legitimate transmitter (Alice) and a legitimate receiver (Bob), the covert performance metrics including the covertness outage probability and covert throughput are computed based on the theoretical derivations of channel gain under dynamic wave, surface refraction, and particle absorption and scattering. The numerical simulation reveals the variation patterns of covert performance metrics with respect to multiple environmental and system parameters, which shows that wave intensity and transmitted beam’s divergence angle have opposite effects on detection performance of Willie locating at different positions, and both the optical wavelength beyond blue-green band and strong ambient light can increase Willie’s detection uncertainty. Furthermore, it can be seen that the upper bound on covertness outage probability reaches 1 and the achievable covert throughput approaches 0 in some cases, while covert threat regions exist in both atmospheric and underwater areas within several meters, which indicates that covert transmission strategy and system parameters are required to be further designed and optimized to enhance communication security."

Validation using 99 distinct TL layout cases shows the model’s computed peak currents all fall within the range of transmission-line modeling method results, while reducing computational time by 95.98%. Leveraging theoretically driven dimensionality reduction, the method provides a highly accurate and computationally efficient solution for electromagnetic compatibility analysis of intra-enclosure TL systems under high-altitude electromagnetic pulse."

To fully leverage these technological advancements, conventional far-field models must be replaced by more accurate near-field spherical-wave propagation models. This paper investigates a near-field communication system comprising a hybrid analog-digital beamforming base station (BS) and multiple mobile users, aiming to maximize system sum-rate through optimized codebook design, beam selection, and digital precoding. To accommodate dynamic user distributions, we propose two model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)-based frameworks that enable prompt adaptation by learning well-initialized models for fine tuning. The first framework integrates the MAML method with a deep neural network (DNN) to design near-field codebooks tailored to the user distributions, addressing the limitations of conventional uniform codebooks. The second framework employs a joint neural network (NN) for beam selection and digital precoding, combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep unfolding. The DRL NN formulates beam selection as a Markov Decision Process, while the deep-unfolding NN approximates optimal digital precoding through a lightweight iterative algorithm without matrix inversion. Simulation results show that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform conventional methods, achieving superior generalization and overall performance in dynamic near-field scenarios."

In the computation process, participants may maliciously attack the system for personal gain by providing false data. Blockchain provides a possible solution for this problem with its immutability and multi-party consensus. However, existing blockchain data throughput has long been queried owing to its exorbitant time and energy costs by consensus mechanisms. This paper proposes a light blockchain structure in distributed computing scenarios. A No-Proof consensus (NPC) mechanism is designed for distributed computing problems with no extra proving process such as Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake. This consensus mechanism notices that the distributed computing result has proven to be valid in the computation process automatically, which does not need to be verified again in the consensus mechanism. Further, the single-threaded data processing ability of the blockchain structure certainly leads to low efficiency when applied to distributed computation problems. An NPC-based blockchain is constructed in this paper to solve this problem. In this structure, the distributed computing is done off chain, and an oracle is designed to upload the computing results to the blockchain asynchronously. Upon the contribution in this paper, a distributed energy trading model is provided as a case study to verify the superiority of the designed blockchain in contrast with other similar structures."

This approach aims to improve mechanical reliability and enable industrial-scale production of compact ultrasound devices. The piezoelectric elements were contacted during the embedding process, involving exposure to heat and pressure, requiring a subsequent repolarization process to restore the piezoelectric behavior. Performance was validated against encapsulated wire-bonded reference samples through electrical impedance measurements and acoustic pitch-catch experiments using a hydrophone in a water tank, with different sound incidence angles. After repoling, the embedded single crystal transducer demonstrated expected piezoelectric behavior in impedance data and achieved a peak negative output pressure amplitude of 4.70 kPa (measured at 10 mm distance in water), compared to 4.45 kPa for the encapsulated wire-bonded reference sample, representing a difference of ≈ 5 %. Directivity patterns showed minimal differences in emission angle, with resonance frequencies varying between prototypes due to the inherent characteristics of different manufacturing approaches in the acoustic stack.

By leveraging Rectified Flow and dynamically adjusting model capacity based on task complexity, which is assessed through features like object counts and precision needs, our method allocates computational resources efficiently and effectively. This results in faster convergence, optimized computational resource usage, and improved precision across diverse manipulation tasks. Our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on widely-used CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv benchmarks, and is further validated through six real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods across all tasks."

    "abstract": "A novel adaptive robust icing and fault tolerant composite control for the trajectory tracking problem of a large blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft with ice accretion, actuator faults, unknown disturbances and uncertainties is proposed. Firstly, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model is developed from the nonlinear dynamics of the BWB aircraft, and a neural network (NN) based LPV controller is investigated for the trajectory tracking. The disturbance observer is designed to overcome the effect of external unknown disturbances. For the actuator faults of the aircraft, a low-complexity fault tolerant controller is developed by fault estimation. To improve the anti-icing performance of the BWB aircraft system, a new icing adaptive compensator is proposed. Simulation scenarios are presented to illustrate that the proposed composite controller has better performances on trajectory tracking under both icing and actuator faults."

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of misinformation on social media threatens public discourse, trust, and decision-making. Existing rumor detection methods—ranging from multimodal fusion to graph-based reasoning—have achieved promising results but often struggle to capture the multiview, heterogeneous, evolving, and adversarial nature of real-world rumor propagation. Common limitations include oversimplified graph structures, shallow temporal modeling (TM), and limited semantic grounding or robustness. To address these challenges, we propose temporal reasoning and detection of emerging network threats (TRIDENT), a unified and interpretable framework that represents rumor events as multiview heterogeneous temporal graphs enriched with external knowledge. TRIDENT integrates a novel partial differential equation–graph convolutional network (PDE-GCN) module for continuous-time temporal encoding, cross-view attention for joint reasoning over user interactions, content semantics, and propagation structure, and multimodal adversarial training to defend against label-preserving manipulations in both text and graph domains.

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression is a critical marker of cerebral small vessel disease; however, its prediction remains challenging due to inter-institutional variability and the inherently non-deterministic nature of lesion evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate preprocessing strategies and prediction frameworks for WMH progression using a large-scale, multi-institutional dataset from the PICASSO trial (67 institutions). We compared three preprocessing pipelines, harmonization, normalization, and their combination, with three prediction frameworks: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-to-FLAIR, WMH-to-WMH, and disease evolution map (DEM). These were assessed in conjunction with multiple deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate that harmonization substantially reduces inter-institutional variability and that the DEM framework consistently outperforms direct image-to-image prediction in volumetric and spatial agreement. Furthermore, we provide the first direct comparison of U-Net, GAN, and diffusion models under identical experimental conditions, showing that diffusion models deliver balanced performance in capturing non-deterministic lesion dynamics. At the same time, U-Net achieves the highest spatial agreement. Collectively, these findings establish the first comprehensive benchmark of WMH progression prediction across preprocessing strategies, prediction frameworks, and model architectures, and underscore the translational potential of DEM-based prediction with harmonization for individualized risk stratification and clinical decision-making."

The exogenous input is assumed to be completely unknown and the only stochastic assumptions are on the output measurements and the initial state. The algorithm includes the Kalman filter which is itself a special case of a system with an inherent delay of zero. The derived recursions take a similar form to the Kalman filter, and are straightforward to implement. The approach uses a standard characterisation of a system's inherent delay in terms of the incremental ranks of a sequence of Toeplitz matrices of Markov parameters. Two judiciously chosen rank decompositions of the relevant Toeplitz matrix corresponding to the inherent delay are used to develop the algorithm. Conditions for the convergence of the filter are also derived and consist of a controllability condition and a minimum phase condition. The paper also presents a smoothing algorithm that can estimate the states and inputs of the system over a fixed time horizon. The theory is illustrated on a field controlled DC motor system with an inherent delay of two and a mass-spring-damper chain system with an inherent delay of five."

In RDMA-based systems, however, they are often neglected because security mechanisms impose significant performance overheads. In this work, we design a secure RDMA data path that ensures confidentiality and integrity by protecting data in transit and at the remote side using encryption and checksums. To reduce security overhead, our system offloads cryptographic operations to the RDMA NIC (RNIC). However, hardware limitations and relatively slow cryptography performance in RNICs make a secure and efficient design challenging. We address these challenges with three key techniques: dynamic key reconfiguration, configuration-data batching, and context pooling. We also conduct a case study with RDMA memory disaggregation systems to evaluate when offloading is beneficial. We find that naive offloading degrades performance and that overlapping CPU's computation with RNIC's cryptography is essential to realizing its benefits. Our evaluation shows that overlapping achieves up to 9.63x lower P99.9 latency than a CPU-based secure RDMA data path on RocksDB."

While this dataset provides valuable insights, ensuring the reliability of its labels remains a key concern. In this study, a vanilla convolutional neural network classifier is applied to the TRDR dataset, coupled with a confident learning strategy to identify and address potential label inconsistencies. By refining the training data through confident learning, the classification accuracy on a balanced sample of the dataset improves from 90.6% to 92.1%.

Its stress tolerance and resistance to herbicides pose challenges for effective management. In this study, we map annual kochia patches using very high-resolution satellite remote sensing imagery. Field surveys (using drones and GPS) were conducted to collect samples for crop vs kochia classification. Very high-resolution Pleiades NEO (PNEO) imagery (30 cm) was collected for six regions (167 fields, nearly 1000 square kilometers) in Saskatchewan, Canada in August 2024. Kochia and crop areas were labeled, and 26 map features, including spectral bands and indices, were compiled. Through a Random Forest algorithm, survey data and drone imagery were integrated into a model to assess satellite-based mapping effectiveness of mapping kochia using satellite imagery. The workflow, implemented in Google Colab, enabled provincial scalability. Key variables observed to highly influence the robustness of our model included image bands of Green, Red, and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index. Using PNEO imagery, a 97% prediction accuracy was achieved, highlighting its potential as a scalable tool for monitoring and managing kochia across varying agricultural landscapes."

    "abstract": "In the domain of battery energy storage systems for Electric Vehicles (EVs) applications and beyond, the adoption of machine learning techniques has surfaced as a notable strategy for battery modeling. Machine learning models are primarily utilized to forecast the state of batteries, specifically focusing on analyzing the state of charge (SOC). A crucial barrier to the adoption of machine learning algorithms in SOC estimation is their lack of explainability. Current ML SOC estimators researched, are highly focused on model performance while neglecting model explainability. This lack of explainability is crucial for stakeholders as they require trust and assurance in models' predictions, particularly applications like EVs, where erroneous SOC estimation can cause potential safety hazards. This work focuses on the explainability of SOC estimation using the Tsetlin Machine. The Tsetlin machine (TM) is a novel intrinsically explainable machine learning algorithm that offers competitive accuracy across various applications with simple Boolean-based logic computation. This paper aims to bridge the gap of model explainability by also comparing the explainable AI technique SHAP with the novel TM algorithm. The results present the TM as a highly competitive algorithm for accurate SOC estimation while offering a precise quantification of the influence of individual attributes to the final prediction without the need for post-hoc techniques."

This paper presents a novel superpixel based approach incorporates Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with a modified segmentation method, for more precise building damage detection from VHR imagery.

Traditional methods, including linear and basic nonlinear approaches, often fail to capture the complex spectral-spatial interactions, noise, and sparsity in high-resolution datasets like those from the Chandrayaan-2 Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS). To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based framework with a patch transformer and innovative constraints for effective nonlinear unmixing. Our contributions include: (1) a patch transformer integrated into the generator to capture complex spatial-spectral relationships; (2) relaxation labeling in the latent space to refine abundance predictions and ensure spatial-spectral consistency; (3) a denoising constraint to enhance noise resilience, leading to reliable abundance maps and reconstructions; and (4) sparsity in abundance maps for efficient representation and improved interpretability. Additionally, synthetic data generation using superpixel segmentation and convolutional autoencoders enriches the training process. Experimental validation on the Cuprite and Chandrayaan-2 IIRS datasets demonstrates superior performance, with significant reductions in RMSE and SAD, addressing challenges of nonlinearities, noise, sparsity, and spatial variability. Our method shows transformative potential for hyperspectral unmixing, enabling accurate and reliable material detection in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial remote sensing applications."

    "abstract": "The interruption of DC faults remains a major obstacle to the widespread deployment of DC grid technologies. The rapid rise of fault currents and the absence of natural current zero-crossing points in DC systems have limited the performance and cost-effectiveness of conventional protection strategies, especially when compared to their AC counterparts. This has led to a growing interest in rethinking traditional protection paradigms, particularly the dependence on dedicated circuit-breaking devices. This paper investigates the feasibility of converter-integrated or breaker-less protection approaches for basic DC-DC converter topologies. By introducing structural modifications, specifically the integration of additional switching components, these converters are adapted to autonomously detect and clear faults on the grid side. Although these modifications may not directly improve efficiency or reduce cost, they can significantly enhance fault response time and the practicality of integrated protection schemes. The study begins with an analysis of conventional DC-DC converter behavior under pole-to-pole short-circuit conditions, followed by simulation-based validation of the proposed modifications. Results demonstrate that the modified converters can effectively interrupt fault currents, highlighting the potential of power electronic converters to serve dual roles in both energy conversion and system protection."

Specifically, we develop an asymmetric multimodal sparse attention (AMSA) mechanism to enhance unimodal features. For visible light, we create a learnable sparse-k operator that can filter the important information in the image. For infrared, we combine sparse-level features to enhance the infrared data’s global and local context.

    "abstract": "In today's tech-driven landscape, product innovation is critical for competitive advantage, but product management (PM) education often fails to keep pace with real-world industry demands. The rise of AI is reshaping product development, requiring skills beyond traditional PM expertise and widening the gap between academia and practice. Engineering curricula emphasize technical proficiency but often overlook essential aspects like product strategy, market dynamics, and innovation management. As a result, aspiring product managers must learn through experience rather than structured education. To address this, the authors developed an elective course “Product Management for the AI Era,” designed for final-semester engineering students. This course is not just a set of lectures but a collaborative learning experience that integrates practical frameworks, industry collaboration, and expert insights to equip students with the skills needed for AI-driven product innovation. The paper outlines the motivation for introducing this multidisciplinary topic with a non-traditional curriculum crafted with inputs from industry/startup practitioners and an engaging delivery format. We hope this helps narrow the academia-industry gap in product management education, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the AI era."

To enhance the representational power of features and allows for a more refined modeling of the importance of spectral band characteristics, we uses 1×1 KAN convolution to construct a deep convolutional layer as the first layer for selecting bands. In the KAN convolution layer, one band corresponds to a spline function, the band weight is represented by the control points of the spline function. By sorting the weights of the control points, the important bands are selected. This method builds additional layers to perform feature extraction and classification on the selected spectral bands. To enhance the band selection process, a multi-teacher approach is proposed to provide guidance, facilitating the model in selecting more optimal bands. It integrates band selection, feature extraction, and classification into an end-to-end framework, achieving joint optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed method BS-ConvKAN achieves promising performance."

The findings demonstrated that CNC can be effectively mapped from satellite with promising accuracy when assessed on independent data (R2 = 0.7 and 0.6, and NRMSE = 15% and 18% for S2 and PR, respectively). A seven-year crop model simulation enabled the assessment of crop performances across soil management zones (MZ), estimating nitrogen uptakes, nitrogen uptake efficiencies, residual soil nitrogen, and the conversion coefficient to convert CNC into actual nitrogen uptake.

    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in the penetration of renewable energy sources, power systems encounter challenges due to the lack of flexible regulation capabilities needed to manage the stochastic, intermittent, and fast variations in output power from these sources. Traditionally, hydro and coal-powered units have served as regulation resources for power system adjustments, but they have limited regulation and ramping capabilities currently for flexible regulation. As the demand for flexible regulation resources grows, new approaches are required to address this issue. This paper reveals and evaluates the value of multiregulation properties to incentivize the provision of regulation capabilities and investment/improvement in flexible regulation resources. A bi-level pricing scheme is proposed to evaluate the value of regulation capabilities based on the marginal utility indicated by dual multipliers. First, price signals for regulation capability is analyzed with dual multipliers. Furthermore, the components of local marginal prices are combined for value expression. Then, a bi-level pricing model incorporating dual multipliers as variables is developed to optimize the value of flexible regulation capabilities. Finally, a modified PJM 5-node example is used to validate the pricing model. The proposed mechanism not only facilitates pricing but also helps characterize the value of a unit's regulation capability."

In this paper, we study the generation method of adversarial samples in remote sensing image description task for security and stability. We propose a black-box attack method for codec structure. The target attack is realized by approaching the target sample code to the target sample, and the black-box attack is realized by the idea of integrated attack. This method does not need to know the specific encoding and decoding network of the model to realize effective attack. This method can be used to judge the robustness and security of existing methods, and also provides a basis for further improving the robustness and security of the methods."

To achieve a wide frequency range, the switching frequency must be increased; however, a higher switching frequency leads to increased switching losses. This paper identifies the minimum switching frequency required for wideband active impedance circuit. The steady-state performance of the current control system limits the emulation bandwidth of the active impedance circuit. A phasor-based analysis is employed to evaluate the minimum switching frequency in terms of both gain and phase, ensuring conformity with the target impedance characteristics. As a result, it is demonstrated that the switching frequency must be at least 29 times the emulated bandwidth to maintain an error within 50%."

    "abstract": "The GEO SAR earth observation system has the advantages of large observation swath and short revisit time, and is one of the main development trends of spaceborne SAR in the future. However, its characteristics such as ultra-long synthetic aperture time, ultra-large observation width and complex imaging geometry make the azimuth space-invariance of raw data no longer valid. The frequency domain algorithm has the disadvantages of complex process flow and low precision in processing azimuth space-variant signals. This paper mainly analyzes the time-frequency distribution and azimuth space-variance of LuTan-4 GEO SAR signals. Due to the serious azimuth space variance, constructing a two-dimensional matched filter based on the scene center target leads to pronounced defocusing and residual RCM for targets located at the azimuthal edges. Moreover, we propose a GEO SAR time domain fast imaging method based on the Iso-Range Iso-Doppler General Surface (IRID-GS) Grid. Theoretical analysis shows that the sub-aperture wavenumber spectrum structure is independent of the choice of Imaging Surface, and the traditional Fast Factorized Back-Projection (FFBP) is a special case of the proposed algorithm under straight trajectory and plane surface. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The high current gradients in addition to the parasitic inductances lead to voltage overshoots, which increase the switching losses or can even destroy the semiconductor. It is therefore important to quantify and experimentally determine these parasitics. This requires a fast and robust measurement method, which provides accurate values. The proposed method is based on the evaluation of oscillations caused by a negative step response and is universally applicable. In this paper, the commutation loop inductances in a GaN-based current source inverter are measured. Experimental results are presented and compared to simulation results."

High-cadence datasets, such as those generated from daily satellite imagery, have opened new possibilities for monitoring change across the Earth’s surface. These datasets enable applications ranging from land-use enforcement and disaster response to agricultural monitoring and environmental conservation. However, the scale and complexity of these datasets present significant challenges in identifying actionable insights, particularly when monitoring expansive geographic regions over extended time periods. Traditional change detection methods in remote sensing, dating back decades, have evolved from basic statistical techniques to advanced machine learning approaches. Recent developments leverage deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and Siamese networks, for bi-temporal and, increasingly, multitemporal change detection. These approaches enable the identification of nuanced patterns of change that are critical for understanding long-term environmental dynamics. This paper explores a novel multi-temporal change detection framework, leveraging high-frequency satellite imagery, the vision transformer neural network architecture, and a multidimensional time-series change point detection algorithm to identify meaningful changes across diverse geographies and change event types. By combining advanced machine learning techniques with the unique attributes of remote sensing data, this work aims to advance scalable and automated solutions for change detection, providing actionable insights."

We introduce the Low-Dimensional Feature Fusion Module (Dual-Modal Attention Fusion Module, DMAF Module) and the High-Dimensional Feature Selection Module (Channel Ranker). DMAF Module employs an attention mechanism to weight and fuse low-dimensional optical and SAR features, and uses a global self-attention mechanism in the transformer to capture the relationships between cross-modal features, achieving spatial and semantic alignment of optical and SAR features. The Channel Ranker utilizes a Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanism to select important channels from high-dimensional features, reducing feature redundancy and improving the effectiveness of feature representation. Experimental results demonstrate that MSFANet outperforms other methods on multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in optical and SAR change detection tasks."

Developed in Solidity and implemented via the Remix IDE, the contract is designed to enforce secure and efficient voting. The performance of the private PoA network was then compared with the Ethereum Sepolia public test network and private blockchain network Kurtosis using Proof of Stake (PoS). Experimental results show that Geth PoA successfully executed all smart contract functions with significantly lower gas costs and faster block times compared to Sepolia and Kurtosis. These findings demonstrate that Geth PoA offers a lightweight, efficient, and reliable platform for running smart contracts in controlled environments such as institutions or organizations.

However, conventional single-carrier phase-coded signals are sensitive to Doppler effects, which hinders the preservation of orthogonality in MIMO systems on moving platforms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fast-time phase-coded linear frequency modulation (PC-LFM) signal, which offers improved Doppler tolerance over traditional slow-time PC-LFM signals. Within the required Doppler range for imaging, the fitness function is defined by minimizing both the average auto-correlation peak side-lobe ratio (PSLR) and the normalized cross-correlation peak (CP). Waveform optimization is performed using the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) based on the Hadamard matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized waveforms exhibit excellent orthogonality and improved SAR focusing performance, making them highly suitable for DLLA 3D SAR systems."

    "abstract": "An effective thermal management of power electronics converters requires a balance between accuracy and computational feasibility of the adopted thermal model for their reliable and optimal operation. However, low-complexity models often lack accuracy under dynamic conditions, such as varying loads and cooling degradation, necessitating an adaptive thermal model. Traditional simplified models are prone to overfitting and are able to adapt the thermal model only if the optimal parameters are identified based on sufficient large amounts of data. To address this, the proposed method for thermal model parameters identification integrates the information of temperature slope and acceleration in the estimation error cost function. Furthermore, the generalization of the thermal model for different converter operation scenarios is enhanced by deploying a Bayesian inference to determine suitable weightings for the aforementioned additional terms. A Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)based optimization is performed to determine the thermal model parameters based on this Bayesian-weighted approach."

This work investigates physical layer authentication techniques that leverage intrinsic channel characteristics for secure, physically and spatially unique communication in high-speed broadcast networks. Specifically, we explore jitter-based fingerprinting and channel cursor adaptation as viable authentication mechanisms. Both techniques are evaluated in terms of their practicality for real-time implementation, distinguishability, and robustness to environmental variations. Simulation results demonstrate that jitter-based authentication provides overall superior uniqueness, with high distinguishability at high losses, whereas cursor adaptation performs better at low losses. The complementary nature of these approaches suggests potential benefits in their dual application in a multi-metric authentication framework."

This study investigates how blockchain can overcome key challenges, including measurement and accountability, stakeholder coordination, financial constraints, and governance barriers. Through a case study of Quantum Temple (QT), a blockchainenabled platform for cultural heritage preservation and regenerative tourism, we analyze how decentralization, transparency, smart contracts, and tokenization enhance value creation, delivery, and capture. Findings reveal that blockchain facilitates impact measurement, equitable revenue distribution, and decentralized funding models.

Accurately estimating LAI and LCC based on remote sensing at high spatial resolution is of great significance for forest dynamics monitoring. The APPLE-GO model is a novel forest canopy BRDF model established at high spatial resolution scenes, providing a new approach for the inversion of biophysical variables at high spatial resolution. In this study, a two-step method was used to retrieve LAI and LCC separately from forest at high spatial resolution imagery. The first step is estimating LAI using adaptive gradient descent algorithm, then based on the retrieval LAI, the leaf reflectance was converted by canopy reflectance using Look-up tables (LUTs) generated from the APPLE-GO model. The second step is retrieving LCC from derived leaf reflectance using the PROSPECT-PRO model. Retrieved LAI and LCC were validated against simulation in LESS. The results indicate a good agreement between retrieved and simulated LAI with RMSE of 0.310 and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.87.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing semantic segmentation is crucial for extracting detailed land surface information, enabling applications such as environmental monitoring, land use planning, and resource assessment. In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks. Detailed ablation studies further highlight the significance of the depth prompts in remote sensing semantic segmentation."

ELD is a critical challenge in power system operation, involving the allocation of generation loads among multiple units to minimize total fuel cost while satisfying system constraints. The proposed OPA draws inspiration from the predatory behavior of orca whales, aiming to enhance both convergence speed and solution quality in complex optimization landscapes. The algorithm was rigorously tested on a large-scale power system comprising 140 generation units, representing a highly complex environment for optimization due to the nonlinear and non-convex characteristics introduced by valve-point effects. Performance comparisons were conducted against well-established metaheuristic algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bat Algorithm, and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Simulation outcomes demonstrated that OPA achieved the lowest total generation cost of ${\\$}$1566089.13, outperforming competing algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency. These results suggest that OPA is a promising and effective approach for solving large-scale ELD problems with practical constraints. Future research may focus on further refining the algorithm’s parameters, integrating it with hybrid methods, and applying it to other complex power system optimization challenges to validate its robustness and versatility."

Fully exploring the spatial-spectral priors of HSI is the core issue for HSI denoising. In this paper, we propose a weighted group sparsity-regularized low-rank matrix factorization (LRMF) model in the gradient domain for HSI mixed noise removal. Particularly, we first introduce the powerful LRMF on the spatial and spectral gradient maps to exploit the global low-rankness of HSI, which factorizes them into the corresponding spatial factor and spectral factor. Moreover, considering the group sparsity of spectral-spatial gradient maps, we introduce a weighted group sparsity regularization on spatial factors, which captures group sparsity more efficiently as compared with directly regularize on gradient maps. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Numerous experiment results indicate that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods."

However, its broad spectral range increases susceptibility to both intentional and unintentional multi-source radio frequency interference (RFI). If not effectively suppressed, such interference can significantly degrade image quality, hindering subsequent applications. Various methods, including notch filtering in the frequency or time-frequency domain, have been proposed, but these often distort the echoes and the spectrum. Other methods that rely on interference modeling may underperform when the model is inaccurate. To address these issues, a multi-source RFI mitigation method for SAR based on matrix completion is proposed. Low-rank matrix completion theory is utilized to restore the damaged spectrum after interference notch filtering. An efficient algorithm is developed using a double Hankel matrix structure and matrix factorization decomposition, eliminating the need for singular value decomposition.

    "abstract": "Cross-scene classification aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target domain with different distributions, and semi-supervised domain adaptation is commonly used to achieve high-performance cross-scene classification based on a few labeled target domain samples. However, there are significant discrepancies between the source and target domains, which hinder dual-domain alignment and knowledge transfer, resulting in limited performance improvement. Therefore, to solve the above issues, a novel semi-supervised cross-scene classification approach called Cross-Augmentation based Adaptive Clustering is proposed. First, a cross-domain data augmentation structure is proposed to facilitate alignment between the source and target domains. By utilizing the CutMix operation to labeled and unlabeled data, the method bridges domain discrepancies and facilitates the pseudo-label propagation through consistency regularization. Second, a adaptive clustering method for pseudo-labeled target domain data is introduced, grouping target data into clusters and further improving the quality of pseudo-labels. This approach facilitate dual-domain alignment and knowledge transfer, therefore improving cross-scene classification performance. Finally, experimental results on two publicly available datasets confirm that the proposed method effectively improves cross-scene classification performance for remote sensing imagery."

Using data from 2018 to 2023, simple linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were employed to gauge the accuracy of PM2.5 predictions from both AOD sources. LR results showed significant MODIS and VIIRS AOD correlations with PM2.5 (P < 0.05), achieving R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values of 25.1% and 15.7%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Substations are critical components in electric power systems, serving as key nodes that connect generation sources, transmission networks, and load centers. Any failure occurring at a substation can have widespread consequences, potentially causing large-scale outages due to its direct connection to both the generation and distribution segments of the grid. Therefore, the reliability of a substation is a vital metric in assessing the overall performance of a power system. Different substations are built with various switching configurations which influences the system’s switching flexibility, fault tolerance, and ultimately, its reliability profile. These configuration differences result in varying reliability indices across substations. In this paper, the reliability of high voltage substations is analyzed using event tree analysis. This study aims to evaluate the impact of substation configuration types and their constituent components including main and backup protection systems, circuit breakers, and busbar protection on substation reliability indices. The results of this analysis are intended to serve as a technical reference for predicting substation performance and as a decision-making foundation for evaluating the reliability performance of power utility companies."

This paper examines co-registration accuracy in overlapping bi-temporal RS acquisitions co-registered with coherent and non-coherent approaches to evaluate the importance of the phase signal. We project and co-register overlapping radargram pairs to mitigate the horizontal changes related to the ice motion and vertical variations in mass balance. We used the log ratio to compare the co-registered data and highlight backscattering differences in the radargrams due to residual misregistration (and morphological changes). We analyze overlapping radargram pairs acquired in Antarctica in 2014 and 2016."

    "abstract": "This study utilizes high-resolution data from NASA's Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission to investigate water dynamics and upstream-downstream impacts across key reservoirs in the Nile Basin. Focusing on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Rosaries Dam, Merowe Dam, and the Aswan High Dam, the analysis spans 15 months (August 2023 to October 2024). By systematically selecting 30 points across each reservoir, monthly boxplots of surface water elevation were generated, revealing significant temporal and spatial variability. The results show that GERD’s filling phase led to a steady increase in water levels (peaking at ~615 meters from June to October 2024), while downstream reservoirs experienced sharp declines. Rosaries and Merowe recorded their lowest levels in July 2024, with delayed recovery starting in September 2024, while the Aswan High Dam showed a gradual decline from April to August 2024, reflecting reduced upstream flows.The findings highlight the hydrological interdependence of Nile Basin reservoirs, where upstream water management, particularly GERD’s operations, has cascading effects on downstream regions. This study demonstrates the value of SWOT satellite data in capturing transboundary water dynamics and emphasizes the need for cooperative water governance strategies, including coordinated reservoir operations and data-sharing mechanisms, to address downstream water stress. By offering actionable data for sustainable resource management, this research represents a critical advancement in leveraging satellite Earth observations to inform policy and foster resilience in the conflict-prone Nile Basin."

Deep learning (DL) methods have proven effective in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of ship-radiated noise classification and have seen widespread application. However, challenges arise due to limited data availability and the difficulty of hydrophone placement for underwater noise signal collection. Additionally, comparative studies across methods remain scarce. This study addresses these challenges by expanding the dataset in two terms of ship model diversity and signal duration. Data fusion with a channel attention module is conducted on three types of acoustic features, which are combined as inputs to the classification models. The classification accuracy of various models and feature combinations is systematically compared. To elucidate the decision strategy for model classification, the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) algorithm is employed to visualize the distribution of effective classification areas. By integrating acoustic features, our method improves classification accuracy meanwhile provides insights into the underlying reasons for this improvement."

We include a comparative evaluation against two widely used slice motor topologies, namely the temple motor and the slotless motor, based on a multi-objective Pareto optimization framework including FEM simulations and detailed closed-loop dynamic models.

Unlike standard design approaches that use numerical methods as reported in previous studies, the proposed approach streamlines the design process and shortens the product development time by relying on data from simulation models. The proposed optimization is carried out in LTspice, optimizing only the key parameters that affect the frequency response of the multi-resonant filter. The MRGD aims to maximize operational efficiency at high frequencies when used in SMPS and resonant power converters. The proposed concepts are assessed and validated through a hardware prototype. With the help of simulation and hardware verification, the MRGD demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving a 34.8% reduction in gate drive losses compared to an off-the-shelf conventional Voltage Source Gate Driver (VSGD) based on UCC27517."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "An ice crystal has uniaxial symmetry about its c axis and is therefore electrically anisotropic. Anisotropy in the real dielectric permittivity at radio wavelengths means that ice is birefringent to radar waves, including those commonly used to sound through ice masses. Radar birefringence can be targeted as a measurement signal to interpret ice anisotropy for ice rheology or ice-flow history; however, birefringent losses can also act as noise when targeting the reflected radar power as a measure of interface properties or attenuation. Here, we implement a method for correcting birefringent losses in multi-frequency radar sounding. Birefringent loss fringes occur at a regular interval that depends on the center frequency of the transmitted signal, so correlating loss fringes from independent measurements (i.e. from radar systems with different frequencies) enables a more precise and robust estimate of electrical anisotropy, which can then be used as a correction for birefringent power losses. We demonstrate our method with an example from a dual-frequency instrument recently used for sounding the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We choose an example where the loss fringes are visible within the specular englacial layers, but we argue that our correction method is useful even for a single diffuse reflector where the loss fringes may be obscured by variations in the reflector properties. Similar birefringent correction methods can be applied to planetary radar sounding cases, such as the two radar sounders orbiting Mars or the dual-frequency radar instrument onboard the Europa Clipper."

Security validation is conducted through black-box testing with Burp Suite and Invicti, and white-box analysis using DeepSource. The evaluation revealed three low-severity vulnerabilities and six threat categories addressed through specific mitigation strategies. Performance measurements show that the system processes vote casting in approximately 91.2 ms and tabulation in 0.030 ms per vote. While the results demonstrate adequate performance and low-risk exposure under controlled conditions, limitations include the lack of manual penetration testing, potential blind spots in business logic validation, and the use of a self-signed certificate. These findings indicate the proposed system is suitable for institutional use, provided that further validation and refinement are undertaken prior to production deployment."

In this study, we propose a method for evaluating prediction accuracy using spatiotemporal population distribution data from past flood events. Additionally, to enhance prediction accuracy as per the proposed evaluation metrics, we attempt to improve the evacuation behavior models of residents. While conventional evacuation behavior prediction models are built on survey results from residents, our proposed method makes it possible to conduct simulations that are more realistic by also considering the geographical characteristics of each resident's location and the timing of evacuation. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved 7.2% reduction in prediction error compared to traditional evacuation behavior models."

    "abstract": "LEO satellites have been widely applied in areas such as regional surveillance and remote sensing. However, a single satellite is limited by its revisit time and cannot provide continuous monitoring of the interested target area. By implementing a constellation of satellites and designing the constellation appropriately, high revisit frequency and even continuous coverage over designated regions can be achieved. This paper proposes an LEO satellite constellation for bistatic radar to achieve detection and surveillance of aerial targets in key regions. The coverage and detection performance of a constellation are closely related to its configuration, which determines the satellites’ positions within the constellation. The overall performance can be optimized by carefully designing this configuration. The constellation design problem can be modeled as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. However, when satellite orbital elements are treated as optimization variables, the decision space increases with the number of satellites, making it difficult for traditional optimization methods to find the optimal solution. This paper proposes a multi-orbit-multi-satellite (MOMS) optimization method, which uses four parameters to define the satellites in an orbital plane, significantly reducing the number of optimization variables for large-scale constellations. Additionally, it modifies the sorting mechanisms of the evolutionary algorithm to adapt to this method. The simulation results show that this method offers rapid convergence capability for large-scale constellations."

The conventional Pareto front estimation method faces difficulties in estimating complex-shaped Pareto fronts because it attempts to estimate the entire Pareto front at once. In contrast, the proposed method iteratively estimates each simpler segment of the complex-shaped Pareto front. The conventional method relies on a single response surface. However, multiple response surface methodologies exist, and their accuracy depends on the specific problem characteristics. To address this issue, the proposed method ensembles multiple response surfaces, each tailored to a specific segment of the Pareto front. To evaluate Pareto front estimation accuracy, this study compares the conventional and proposed methods using two- and three-objective WFG1 test problems with complex-shaped Pareto fronts. The comparison is conducted by varying both the number of known solutions used for Pareto front estimation and the number of concave and convex regions in the Pareto front. The results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble Pareto front estimation method achieves lower estimation errors than the conventional method in the majority of cases."

Efficient management of these diseases is critical for preserving the health of local crops. This study proposes a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to diagnose diseases in apple leaves. In this approach, the CNN serves as a feature extractor, while the SVM classifies the extracted features to determine the presence of diseases. This method provides an effective diagnostic tool, contributing to improved disease management in their crops. By combining a CNN with an SVM, high performance is achieved in diagnosing apple leaf diseases. The model was trained and validated using the PlantVillage dataset, with data augmentation and a sample from the Plant Pathology 2021 dataset to increase the diversity of the dataset. Augmentation techniques included rotation, flipping, zoom, translation, and cropping. The proposed model achieved 98.25% in metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score, outperforming traditional CNN models and other hybrid approaches. These results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the model, establishing it as a promising tool for disease detection in agricultural applications."

    "abstract": "As control systems increasingly rely on limited-bandwidth networks, quantization and data rate constraints present significant challenges for iterative learning control (ILC). This study aims to design a general framework of linear encoding–decoding pairs for quantized ILC under channel transmission constraints. We first develop a unified mathematical framework that integrates existing encoding–decoding schemes within the quantized ILC loop, enabling both the linear encoder and decoder designs to be parameterized by a common set. By employing a p-type controller, we derive a convergence criterion for quantized ILC using the general linear encoding–decoding pair. Furthermore, we introduce a control signal fidelity metric (CSFM) to quantify the discrepancy between the control signal generated with and without a general linear encoding–decoding pair. Based on the CSFM, we provide systematic guidelines for selecting the parameters of the linear encoding–decoding pair. Finally, we establish practical selection rules for the parameters of linear encoding–decoding pairs when finite-level quantizers are used. These rules ensure that no saturation occurs while minimizing both the steady-state output tracking error and the CSFM, thus facilitating the practical quantizer selection in quantized ILC. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations involving industrial robot joint models."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of aerospace power distribution systems, conventional solid-state power controller (SSPC) modeling approaches exhibit significant limitations in multi-physics coupling coordination, complex characteristic representation, and predictive capability, which is difficult to meet the design requirements of high reliability and high efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a collaborative electromagnetic-thermal-mechanical co-modeling and simulation method for SSPC applications. By integrating detailed electrical circuit simulations with finite element thermal-mechanical analyses, a unified cross-domain modeling framework encompassing electrical, thermal, and mechanical fields is established. A multi-time scale coupling strategy related to SSPC operating conditions is designed to efficiently and accurately capture steady-state and rapid transient behaviors, balancing computational efficiency and simulation precision. The proposed method is validated on a 270 V/200 A SSPC module, demonstrating a good match between simulated and experimental results, with errors of key electrical and temperature parameters below 5%, and thermal strain differences less than 10%, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed methodology provides a comprehensive and precise tool for SSPC design optimization and reliability evaluation, and effectively improves the accuracy, efficiency and reliability of product development."

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning technology has automated the diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract disease, enabling doctor-machine collaborative diagnosis. However, the images captured by wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) easily suffer from varying brightness levels of low-light degradation due to the complex structure of GI tract and the limitations of the light source, which impacts both human and machine diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, images may contain varying degrees of structural and semantic details even under a similar brightness level, which still can compromise segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a dual-generalization framework for low-light WCE images. Our framework includes an Image Guidance and Laplacian Fusion Module (IGLFM), a Brightness Level Generalization Module (BLGM) and a Wavelet Segmentation Generalization Module (WSGM). IGLFM and BLGM can restore low-light images across different brightness levels and WSGM can enhance segmentation accuracy by generalizing the varying degrees of details across images. With BLGM and WSGM, our framework enables two aspects of generalization: generalization to input images with different brightness levels and generalization to images with varying detail levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance under varying brightness levels and improvements in segmentation accuracy, surpassing the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with gains of 4.70 dB / 0.022 (PSNR/SSIM) on Kvasir-Capsule dataset and 1.61 dB / 0.018 on RLE dataset. WSGM consistently improves segmentation accuracy across six popular networks, achieving up to +4.7% mIoU and +5.3% Dice improvements on RLE dataset.

However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms."

The proposed approach enables independent control over each subband—such as order, bandwidth, and return loss—while supporting flexible placement of transmission zeros (TZs) for enhanced out-of-band selectivity. The synthesis is built upon a new class of characteristic polynomials defined in the nonnormalized <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\omega $</tex-math> </inline-formula>-domain, which intrinsically realizes composite low-pass and multi bandpass filtering behavior without requiring frequency transformation.

    "abstract": "Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown its great superiorities in resource savings and information exchanges. However, while its unique background knowledge guarantees accurate semantic reasoning and recovery, semantic information security-related concerns are introduced at the same time. Since the potential eavesdroppers may have the same background knowledge to accurately decrypt the private semantic information transmitted between legal SemCom users, this makes the knowledge management in SemCom networks rather challenging in joint consideration with the power control. To this end, this paper focuses on jointly addressing three core issues of power allocation, knowledge base caching (KBC), and device-to-device (D2D) user pairing (DUP) in secure SemCom networks. We first develop a novel performance metric, namely semantic secrecy throughput (SST), to quantify the information security level that can be achieved at each pair of D2D SemCom users. Next, an SST maximization problem is formulated subject to secure SemCom-related delay and reliability constraints. Afterward, we propose a security-aware resource management solution using the Lagrange primal-dual method and a two-stage method. Simulation results demonstrate our proposed solution nearly doubles the SST performance and realizes less than half of the queuing delay performance compared to different benchmarks."

    "abstract": "The mid-band frequency range, combined with extra-large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA), is emerging as a critical enabler for future communication systems. However, deploying mid-band ELAA systems presents significant challenges due to the high complexity and overhead associated with signal processing tasks such as channel state information (CSI) acquisition. This paper introduces an efficient transmission framework that incorporates a distributed hardware architecture, distributed channel modeling, and a dual time-scale transmission protocol. Building upon this framework, a practical implementation is proposed, leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based radio frequency (RF) front-ends and linear receivers as the hardware foundation. Additionally, a novel transmission strategy is developed, exploiting both statistical and instantaneous CSI. The proposed framework includes approximations of the ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) to guide DFT beam selection based on statistical CSI. Furthermore, two user scheduling strategies are introduced, utilizing statistical CSI and location information, respectively, with angular division implemented in a distributed manner. Reduced-dimensional instantaneous CSI is then employed for both local and centralized processing. To support system design, the proposed transmission strategy’s ergodic SE performance is analyzed, focusing on the DFT RF front-end and the eigenvalue characteristics of channel correlation matrices. Numerical results reveal that the proposed framework and transmission strategy achieve SE comparable to fully-digital architectures, while significantly reducing overhead and complexity."

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have got a great success in high-resolution remote sensing analysis, especially Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer. However, CNNs have a failure in modeling the long-range dependency because of their fixed receptive fields and Transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity relative to image resolution. The RWKV model achieves breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) through its linear-complexity sequence modeling; however, it exhibits anisotropic limitations in vision tasks due to the constraints of its one-dimensional scanning mechanism. To address these challenges, we adapt the RWKV architecture to high-resolution remote sensing and propose the Remote Sensing RWKV (RSRWKV) model, which incorporates a Linear-Complexity 2D Attention Mechanism. Specifically, RSRWKV employs a novel 2D-WKV scanning mechanism that bridges sequential processing with two-dimensional spatial reasoning while maintaining linear computational complexity. This design facilitates the aggregation of isotropic contexts in multiple spatial directions. Then, the MVC-Shift module further optimizes multiscale receptive field coverage, whereas the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module improves cross-channel feature interaction and semantic saliency modeling. Experimental evaluations on the NWPU RESISC45, VHR-10 v2, SSDD and GLHWater datasets demonstrate that RSRWKV surpasses CNN and Transformer baselines in classification, detection and segmentation tasks, establishing a scalable framework for high-resolution remote sensing analysis.

With the increasing number of installed wind power generation units worldwide, efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring strategies become more relevant. Gearboxes and bearings are critical components in wind turbine (WT) operation, and enhancing the monitoring of these components contributes to improving wind power technology reliability and overall performance. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have emerged as tools for fault diagnosis in gearboxes and bearings in many different rotating machines, with the capacity to extract features from data and perform fault diagnosis in a more automated way. Even though DL methods can achieve high accuracy rates in diagnosis tasks, proper model training and application pose several challenges. In rotating machines fault diagnosis, DL models learn from labeled datasets; thus, these models can show poor generalization to classify data from unseen conditions. Such problem is concerning for WTfault diagnosis, where public available labeled datasets are scarce. In addition, DL models have inherently low interpretability, raising concerns about its application to real scenarios. In this context, this paper presents a literature review of the recent research on DL methods applied to fault diagnosis of WT bearings and gearboxes. The review focuses on the main challenges faced in this field, presenting and discussing the main strategies proposed to address them, including Transfer learning and explainable artificial intelligence techniques. This work aims to support future research and development on WT condition monitoring by providing a critical overview of current methodologies."

However, the large number of switches, driver circuits, and magnetics in the converter can lead to low efficiency under light-load conditions. Although phase-shedding method can effectively improve light-load efficiency by shutting down one or two bridges when the load current decreases, implementing these strategies in resonant converters based on integrated magnetic cores is challenging due to the magnetic coupling between phases. To address this issue, this paper proposes and optimizes a planar integrated magnetic core structure that integrates all magnetic components, significantly enhancing power density. This structure effectively mitigates the coupling between phases, simplifying the implementation of the phase-shedding method and further reducing core losses with additional optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed optimized design is validated through experimental testing on a 2.5 kW three-phase CLLC resonant converter prototype based on SiC devices."

Based on a 40nm CMOS technology, the proposed dual-path-based smart write scheme with DGA write driver achieves power savings of 86.27% at early judge termination and 67.64% at write complete termination, with no additional timing overhead compared to other write termination schemes.

To enhance antipollution flashover performance in porcelain based oil filled transformer bushings, silicone rubber coatings are widely used. However, silicone rubber undergoes significant degradation when exposed to transformer oil, necessitating material enhancement. This study investigates the aging performance of TiO₂ doped silicone rubber composites thermally aged in synthetic ester oil at 80°C for 250 hours. TiO₂ was selected for its high thermal conductivity, dielectric strength, and potential to improve aging resistance. Composites with 0, 1, 5, 10 and 15 wt.% TiO₂ nanoparticles were synthesized. Ester oil aging degraded all specimens physicochemical, thermal, and electrical properties. Weight gain analysis showed reduced oil absorption in TiO₂ doped samples compared to unfilled specimens. FTIR analysis revealed scission of Si-O-Si backbone and Si-CH₃ side chains post aging, resulting in reduced surface hydrophobicity. Thermal stability, evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis, showed decreased residual weights and increased surface cracking in all aged samples. Tracking and erosion resistance, assessed per IEC 60587, declined in aged specimens. Also, infrared thermography revealed significantly lower surface temperatures in TiO₂ filled composites during tracking and erosion testing. Surface charge studies indicated reduced charge accumulation and faster decay rates in aged samples, with TiO₂ composites showing better retention properties. Among tested formulations, the 10 wt.% TiO₂ composite exhibited superior resistance to ester oil aging degradation, demonstrating its potential as an enhanced coating material for transformer bushing applications."

This study investigates the application of deep learning techniques to enhance both the detection and localization of PD events in generator stator windings, as well as to predict the associated apparent charge. Using a comprehensive finite element method (FEM)-based simulation model, PD data are generated and subsequently analyzed with various neural network architectures, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), CNN + long short-term memory (LSTM) hybrids, and transformer. The models are evaluated on two primary tasks: PD localization and apparent charge prediction. The transformer model demonstrates superior performance in PD event localization, largely due to its self-attention mechanism, which captures long-range dependencies within the data. In contrast, the CNN model outperforms the other models in charge prediction, achieving the lowest max deviation and max variation, thereby minimizing prediction errors. The study also explores the trade-offs between model complexity, computational efficiency, and prediction accuracy, offering valuable insights into optimal model selection for specific tasks in industrial applications."

However, traditional TC monitoring methods often rely on separate models for different tasks, requiring multi-step workflows and pre-alignment of TC centers, which introduces inefficiencies and limits their robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep-learning framework for Universal TC Monitoring (UTCM). The UTCM model leverages satellite infrared imagery to simultaneously perform three key monitoring tasks: TC center location, intensity estimation, and R34 wind radius estimation. The model integrates a ResNet152-based feature extraction module with a multi-task branching module, enhanced by a cross-branch learning mechanism to capture inter-task relationships. Additionally, a physics-informed constraint derived from the mathematical relationships among TC center, intensity, and R34 wind radius is embedded into the loss function to improve accuracy and physical consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that the UTCM model outperforms single-task models, achieving 3.81%, 4.74%, and 4.03% improvements in TC center location, intensity estimation, and R34 wind radius estimation, respectively. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining satellite infrared imagery with physics-informed deep learning for robust, efficient, and accurate TC monitoring, contributing to improved warning systems and disaster management strategies."

    "abstract": "Long-term fractional snow cover (FSC) data is a critical input for hydrological, climatic, and energy balance models, making its monitoring essential for understanding global climate and hydrological processes. AVHRR, as a unique long-term remote sensing sensor, provides valuable snow cover data, but its low spatial resolution and limited spectral bands present challenges for accurate snow cover retrieval. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an improved AVHRR FSC mapping algorithm by combining time-scale decomposition with XG Boost, using MODIS observations to enhance spatial resolution and accuracy. The model generates AVHRR FSC products with 500 m resolution, significantly improving FSC accuracy compared to the original AVHRR data, with RMSE reduced from 0.196 to 0.107. These results highlight the potential of AVHRR in long-term snow cover monitoring and the benefit of combining machine learning and higher-resolution data."

Firstly, change detection using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is applied to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, leveraging spectral and backscatter features to accurately identify unchanged areas. Subsequently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed for feature extraction, enabling the extraction of deeper, abstract features from the images. Finally, Random Forest (RF) is used for mapping, capitalizing on its ability to process high-dimensional data effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved excellent class separability, with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 88.2% and an average Kappa coefficient of 0.853. In addition, the CNN_RF classification conducted on the Yellow River Delta from 2019 to 2024 reveals that the extensive eradication of Spartina alterniflora is achieved as a result of government intervention."

Previous work relating to agile imaging focuses mostly on scheduling, for example by dividing point, line and area targets into straight line segments that are scheduled to be consecutively imaged. A question that is little addressed in the literature is how to define curved imaging target paths for agile satellites. We present a simple approach to generate a curved imaging target path for agile imaging that considers coverage goals and an angular velocity constraint. The approach is verified by commanding the curved imaging paths to the push-broom hyperspectral imaging satellites HYPSO-1/2. The approach is able to automatically define suitable imaging paths given HYPSO-1/2’s maneuvering constraints, and specified ground target and observation time."

High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grids can be used to supply these plants, as they are widely employed to transmit large amounts of renewable energy over long distances. In this paper, a low-frequency transformer-based solution for providing the required output voltage for electrolyzers is explored. Specifically, this paper focuses on designing a transformer cascade that enables high-ratio, high-power voltage conversion. The applicability of transformer scaling laws to this scenario is examined and the increase in transformer window size at different voltage ratings is analyzed. A detailed comparison of single-stage and two-stage transformer solutions is performed, considering factors such as material usage, losses, and leakage impedance. The proposed solutions are modeled and simulated using Ansys Maxwell software. The results indicate that the increase in material costs for a two-stage solution is considerably lower than predicted by conventional scaling laws."

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated significant computational efficiency due to its explicit scene representation and fast differentiable rasterization algorithm. However, its direct application to satellite remote sensing is hindered by the precise camera pose requirements and the challenges posed by complex lighting conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an improved 3DGS algorithm (Shadow-GS) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of 3D satellite image reconstruction. First, we mitigate 3DGS’s reliance on precise camera poses by converting the Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) parameters of satellite images into equivalent pinhole camera parameters, simplifying the projection process. Second, we introduce a shadow-aware irradiance model to learn the irradiance under different solar angles, enabling the method to handle multi-view satellite images with varying lighting conditions. Experimental results on the DFC2019 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in satellite scene reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Deep learning recognition methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing images are adapted from approaches used in optical image recognition. However, due to the fundamental differences between SAR and optical images, directly applying optical image interpretation methods to SAR images faces certain limitations. Many researchers have introduced the attribute scattering center (ASC) model to address the challenge of using deep learning methods for SAR image interpretation. Existing mainstream methods include ASC-CNN fusion approaches. However, most fusion methods generally have several issues: (1) the ASC extraction process must be completed in advance, making the approach non-end-to-end; (2) directly combining the low-dimensional features of ASC with the high-dimensional features of CNN leads to mismatched features; (3) the fusion process is often complicated, making it difficult to develop a general and effective enhancement methodology for SAR automatic target recognition (ATR). To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a performance enhancement paradigm based on the ASC model, namely an ASC-based Scattering Enhancement Matrix (SEM). The matrix is generated by a brief dual-encoder single-decoder network and performs pixel-level dynamic enhancement on original SAR images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the performance of various networks in SAR image target recognition tasks, particularly when faced with insufficient training samples."

Traditional models utilizing curve-fitting methods require large amount of measurement data to match with, which lacks accuracy and generality. In contrast, this work proposes a physics-based model that directly links microscopic magnetic dynamics to macroscopic material properties, providing an intrinsic description of nonlinearity. The model translates the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations into equivalent circuits that capture the rotational dynamics of a magnetic domain, where the three-dimensional magnetization is represented by voltages, and the magnetic fields by currents. This approach clarifies the physical origins of nonlinear magnetic losses and permeability variations. Simulation results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately simulate magnetization processes, frequency-dependent complex permeability, B-H loop and magnetic core losses under different DC bias conditions, with validation against datasheet data for a commercial ferrite core (N87)."

However, the manual analysis of flight videos by experts is labor-intensive. Moreover, the wide variety of anomalies that can cause network interruptions makes it impractical to develop dedicated automated solutions for each type, particularly due to the limited number of examples available for many anomalies. We thus propose a method to automatically detect anomalies in scenarios where no prior information about the visual appearance of anomalies is available, using drone-acquired videos. The approach relies on the computation of an anomaly score based on a generic feature vector. Results demonstrate that this approach is effective in scenarios without any examples of anomalies and requires very limited computational resources for learning."

First, given that ExG signals usually exhibit distinct specific patterns, the DWT for them can be simplified by focusing on certain wavelet levels. This excludes redundant convolution operations and resulting wavelet coefficients, reducing the computation load. Second, the algorithm employs a splitting strategy that distributes the DWT computation load across the intervals of other MCUs' tasks, such as data sampling, to reduce the peak computation time. To verify the performance of the proposed computationally efficient algorithm, we implemented it in the MCU (nRF52832) using the MIT-BIH ECG dataset as input.

The results indicate that the TBDs between FY-3D/MWRI and AMSR2 are lower than those between F18/SSMIS and AMSR2. Then, we compared the sensitivity of seven semi-empirical snow depth retrieval algorithms to TBDs from different sensors. The results show that the AMSR2 algorithm exhibits a lower mean difference, while the SPD algorithm shows a lower standard deviation (std) compared to other global algorithms. China-specific algorithms are less sensitive to TBDs compared to other semi-empirical algorithms in China, with the mean and std of snow depth difference less than 0.8 cm and 1.9 cm, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a direct estimation method for surface albedo tailored to high-latitude regions and evaluate its accuracy based on MERSI-II observations. The validation of ground measurements indicates that our algorithm achieves high accuracy, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.040 and an absolute mean bias of 0.022. Furthermore, our study reveals that the reliability of retrieval results is significantly influenced by the quality of MERSI-II cloud mask products, which demonstrate an overestimation of cloud cover compared with ground-based clear-sky observations."

This research proposes a personal information anonymization validation algorithm to address such issue. First, the YOLOv8s model is employed to detect anonymized images' color block targets and extract their coordinate information. Subsequently, an enhanced yolov8s-ATS model is proposed specifically for detecting small-scale faces and license plates, and obtaining their coordinate information. Finally, the algorithm determines the success of anonymization by analyzing the occlusion relationships among facial, license plate, and color block targets. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv8s-ATS model achieves a 2.4% improvement in detection accuracy for faces and license plates and a 1% increase in anonymization detection rate."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing images in environmental monitoring demand high spatial and temporal resolution, which are challenging to achieve with a single sensor. To address this challenge, spatiotemporal fusion provides an effective solution. This paper presents a novel method based on the Vision Trans-former (ViT). A multi-scale ViT extracts fine-grained spatial and temporal features, which are then fused using an adaptive feature fusion module and enhanced with texture compensation to predict high-quality images. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach better utilizes spatial prior information of reference images, reduces fusion errors, and enhances usability. Evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance."

This strategy addresses localized overheating in motor winding due to imbalanced phase currents during fault-tolerant operation. First, the electromagnetic torque model and the thermal model of FTPMSM are proposed, enabling precise calculation of the motor's output torque and temperature. Then, the IOFTC is proposed to reduce the maximum winding temperature during fault-tolerant operation. Additionally, a simplified solution method is proposed for the six-phase FTPMSM to facilitate the application of the IOFTC in engineering. Finally, the effectiveness of the IOFTC is validated on a simulation platform, which can ensure stable output torque and significantly reduce the maximum winding temperature during fault-tolerant operation, thereby enhancing the motor's electromagnetic torque output under fault conditions."

However, the characteristic of small winding inductance leads to a rapid current change rate, making it difficult to apply the current hysteresis control. For the hysteresis controller-based open-circuit fault-tolerant control, this paper applies a series inductor between the stator windings of the YASA machine and the inverter to suppress the current fluctuations. Additionally, the traditional hysteresis controller is improved by introducing self-adaptive duty cycle, thereby increasing the switching frequency without adding computational burden to the controller. By combining these two methods, the current fluctuation and peak-to-peak torque can be reduced by 95.2% and 91.65%, respectively."

The study analysed the mapping of fire regimes and spatio-temporal fire patterns. The k-means algorithm has been used to cluster the fire regimes based on various fire regime variables. Six distinct fire regimes have been identified, and statistical analyses have been conducted to observe fire trends over time. The study revealed more than 88% of the land has been affected by vegetation fires. Cropland burning has accounted for most fire events, particularly in the northern Indo-Gangetic plains, where agricultural residue burning has become prevalent.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In recent decades, radio-echo sounding (RES) has been extensively applied to study the flow and form of polar ice sheets. In certain regions within the ice sheet, the RES reveals a structure referred to as a 'basal unit', which differs from the overlying ice in terms of its characteristics, structure, and origin, and plays a significant role in the ice's rheology and flow dynamics. However, methods for detecting basal units in RES data are semi-quantitative and can lead to inconsistent identification. To address this issue, we propose an automatic ‘basal unit identification method’ based on signal feature and weight control. The method improves upon previous works in three aspects. 1) It simultaneously uses the signal and image features of RES and reduces inaccuracies associated with image analysis. 2) This method assigns weight to signal features that are affected by particle concentrations consistent with backscattering in basal units, reduces the interference of concentration on signal characteristics, and improves the ability to identify basal unit. 3) It provides weights related to signal feature recognition and calculates a composite recognition result that automatically identifies basal units. To validate the method’s effectiveness, we applied it to airborne RES data collected in recent years from the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM) and Princess Elizabeth Land (PEL) regions in East Antarctica. A comparative analysis of the new method and previous methods indicates more accurate basal unit identification due to stronger resistance to interference from particle concentrations consistent with backscattering."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation for EO is a process that involves assigning a specific label or category to each pixel in an image, enabling precise analysis for land cover applications such as environmental conservation, urban planning or disaster management. Deep learning-based segmentation models have proliferated in recent years, but they often are not well adapted to the unique properties of multi and hyperspectral images, frequently used in remote sensing. Mask2Former is a universal segmentation model based on the concept of masked attention and employs a pretrained classification model as backbone to create intermediate representations. This article presents a preliminary adaptation of Mask2Former for the segmentation of multispectral remote sensing images. This adaptation includes modifying the backbone to accept multispectral inputs and adapting the data processing pipelines to leverage all available spectral bands effectively. The computational cost of the method has also been analyzed as an initial assessment of potential scalability and efficiency for large-scale applications. Experimental results using the FiveBillionPixels dataset reveal a notable improvement in segmentation accuracy when incorporating multispectral bands, outperforming RGB-only performance without a relevant increase in computational cost."

Using state-of-the-art facilities involving a temperature chamber and a microwave analyzer, permittivity measurements were conducted at temperatures from -70°C to 0°C and across frequencies from 0.1 GHz to 50 GHz. The results led to the development of a temperature and frequency-dependent model for the real part of the ice dielectric constant. This model differs from the current expressions for the real part of the pure ice relative permittivity, such as Matzler and Tiuri models, by introducing a weak frequency dependence. The updated model is anticipated to enhance the accuracy of microwave remote sensing applications for Cryosphere studies, particularly in scenarios involving cold ice and broad frequency bands. Future work will aim at measuring the imaginary part of the dielectric constant as well and validating the new permittivity model through simulations and real-world remote sensing data comparisons."

Focused on formation mechanism on drought, the theory and method of drought prediction and changes in disaster risk need to be paid more attention. In the research, three drought indices were utilized to construct a Synthetical Drought Characteristic Index (SDCI), aiming to accurately characterize drought events. Furthermore, a deep learning model, integrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), VGG network, and Convolutional Long Short - Term Memory (ConvLSTM), was developed to predict the SDCI. Subsequently, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) interpretative model was established to screen out features of greater significance to the deep learning model. The research comprehensively analyzed the screened factors in terms of temporal evolution, spatial distribution patterns, and factor interdependencies. The results demonstrate that the CBAM-VGG-ConvLSTM model is highly effective in predicting drought events and SHAP model can identify features with a greater impact on drought. By correlating historical drought events with the interpretative model to analyze the contribution of each feature, more effective remote sensing meteorological indices for drought prediction can be screened out."

    "abstract": "High-resolution remote sensing images (RSIs) are usually characterized by complex backgrounds and significant intra-class and inter-class scale variance, making long-range contextual information (LRCI) essential for semantic change detection (SCD). However, image cropping operations tend to truncate the LRCI inherent in RSIs, that would compromise the integrity of geometric features and disrupts the dependency of semantic correlations. To address these limitations, we propose a context synergy and multitask interaction network (CSMINet). Specifically, an extra context synergy branch is introduced to aggregate LRCI from broader image regions, compensating for the loss of contextual correlations in cropped images. CSMINet comprises three pivotal modules: the context synergy guidance module (CSGM), the local-dominant context-synergy fusion module (LCFM), and the decoder feature-aligned interaction module (DFIM). The CSGM is utilized to filter valuable LRCI that enhances contextual associations. The LCFM achieves fine-grained feature fusion, which is dominated by local features and synergized with long-range contextual information. The DFIM facilitates efficient information interaction across subtasks, bridging the gap between semantic representations and change targets. Extensive testing on two benchmark datasets validates the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming six comparative methods across various evaluation metrics and achieving Fscd of 62.13% and 67.83%, respectively."

We observe that different gate designs of the manufacturers and low temperatures result in different dominant mechanisms contributing to the leakage current. Existing physics-based p-GaN gate HEMT models have been verified for these mechanisms by comparison to measurements. Based on physics-based models, a simplified model is presented to describe the dominant mechanisms with fewer parameters over the wide temperature range. The parameter extraction does not require any detailed information about the devices, which is often not available. This provides a basis for using the gate leakage current as a temperature-sensitive electrical parameter (TSEP). Even fabrication spread of GaN HEMTs can be taken into acount in the proposed simplified model by adjusting only two parameters."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an analytical algorithm for minimizing the output capacitor RMS current in asymmetric multi-input interleaved converters. By jointly considering the first and second harmonics of the capacitor current, the method determines optimal phase shifts between converter modules without requiring iterative computation. Experimental validation on two- and three-module three-level boost converters confirms that the proposed technique accurately predicts the phase angles that achieve minimal capacitor current. Reducing the capacitor RMS current not only lowers losses but also enhances reliability and extends component lifetime."

    "abstract": "The Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy (VERITAS) mission is designed to produce the first Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of another planet using bi-static Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To achieve its scientific goals, the DEM is required to reach 300 m posting and 10 m vertical accuracy. While these metrics are routinely surpassed in Earth observation projects, spacecraft orbit uncertainties and atmospheric influences make the Venus case more challenging. As an alternative to reference stations not available on the surface of Venus, naturally-occurring radar-bright features have been proposed to provide additional constraints for the absolute referencing of DEM and orbit calibration. In this study, we present simulation results of localizing such Ground Control Features (GCFs) in 3D under noisy conditions similar to the ones expected from VERITAS. We also consider the influence of spatiotemporally-variable atmospheric delays affecting the radar measurements in X-band (the frequency applied by the VERITAS SAR instrument). Finally, we discuss the potential of 3D GCF localization to provide the necessary constraints to achieve the DEM vertical accuracy requirements as determined by the mission."

In the spectrum of healing, IMDs are positioned between drugs and surgery and have increasingly become acceptable as well as available, thereby providing patients with life-saving therapies like cardiac pacing to well-being monitoring like glucose tracking. One of the groundbreaking applications of IMDs has been neurostimulation based Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), where not only ailments like Epilepsy and Parkinson's Disease have been successfully addressed but effective pain management has been achieved. The advancement in treatment based on neurostimulation needs a closed loop system where the patient needs are addressed quickly. The impediment in that pursuit has been the existence of artifacts in the neural sensing path. This review presents an overview of challenges presented by artifacts and the state-of-the-art in circuit-based artifact cancellation techniques applied to achieve concurrent neural sensing and stimulation."

This approach is particularly advantageous for handling commercial satellite imagery or sensitive ship annotations. Four FL models—FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and FedMedian—are evaluated and compared to a local training baseline, where the YOLOv8 ship detection model is independently trained on each dataset without sharing learned parameters. The results reveal that FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over training on smaller local datasets and achieve performance levels close to global training that uses all datasets during the training. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate FL configurations, such as the number of communication rounds and local training epochs, to optimize detection precision while maintaining computational efficiency."

However, the resonant tank capacitor is particularly susceptible to aging and eventual failure, as it is subjected to high-frequency charging and discharging cycles that accelerate wear and degradation. To address this issue, a new capacitance estimation method has been presented, specifically designed for the online condition monitoring of the resonant tank capacitor. An in-depth analysis is provided on the voltage gain characteristics of resonant tank to accurately estimate capacitance values, thereby enabling proactive detection of capacitor degradation. Notably, the need for additional external circuitry is eliminated by this approach, simplifying implementation and reducing costs. Simulation studies have been conducted to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Understanding the impact of the control design on the converter output impedance is thus essential. In the lower frequency range, asymmetric control elements such as the phase-locked loop (PLL) or DC link control introduce frequency coupling, resulting in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system structure. Deriving the MIMO converter impedance model can be a complex and demanding task. This paper presents a structured approach to model the converter output impedance based on its signal-flow graph that accounts for asymmetric control loops and frequency coupling. The technique is applied to analyze the impedance of a real converter system, focusing on the lowfrequency range. The obtained analytical impedance curves are validated by experimental impedance measurements that capture frequency coupling. Finally, the validated converter impedance matrix is used to assess and mitigate a low-frequency instability observed in a power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) setup."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detection plays a crucial role in diverse maritime applications. Although artificial neural networks (ANNs)-based methods have achieved remarkable detection performance, their substantial energy consumption limits practical deployment on edge devices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural systems, exhibit significant advantages in energy efficiency by encoding information through sparse spatiotemporal spike patterns. Additionally, attention mechanisms can effectively mitigate the inherent limitations of local receptive fields, thereby enhancing target feature representation and suppressing background clutter , which improves detection accuracy. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an energy-efficient attention-based spiking YOLO network (EAS-YOLO) for SAR ship detection. Specifically, we adopt a spike-driven paradigm leveraging sparse additive computations to significantly reduce energy consumption. Moreover, we incorporate a spiking attention mechanism designed to capture content-dependent global interactions and effectively learn long-range contextual information, further enhancing detection performance. Experimental results on the HRSID dataset demonstrate the advantages of SNNs in terms of energy efficiency for SAR ship detection tasks when deployed on edge devices."

A two-layer control architecture is introduced, where the upper layer handles charging scheduling while the lower layer focuses on voltage regulation. The framework is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and trained using an Actor-Critic structure capable of managing mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. Simulation results on a modified IEEE 14-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with conventional methods like Deep Q-network (DQN), Proximal policy optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), our approach achieves faster convergence and superior voltage stability across varying levels of EV penetration, ensuring all nodal voltages remain within safe operational limits.

However, due to the generally low quality of DAS signals and the complexity of noise types, the application of the technology is limited. In response to the current problem, this study extends a non-local mean filtering method based on PDNet (a phase denoising technology in the InSAR field). This method makes full use of the characteristics that the noise in the simulated DAS signal obeys a zero-mean distribution in the phase domain and satisfies the conditions of a stationary ergodic process. By identifying the similarities between signal samples at different times at the equivalent optical fiber position, the original simulated DAS signal is processed. Experimental results show that this method can significantly reduce the phase noise of the DAS signal and retain key signal characteristics."

    "abstract": "Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (BiSAR) is a SAR imaging system where the receiver and transmitter are located on different platforms. The imaging performance of BiSAR is influenced by its observation geometry. Therefore, the imaging performance can be improved by adjusting the bistatic configuration. In practical applications, specific imaging tasks have performance requirements, e.g., spatial resolution and SNR to be better than a desired value. Therefore, it is necessary to find the suitable bistatic configuration that meets the performance requirements in order to accomplish the task. Consequently, this paper models the problem as a nonlinear inequality system (NIS) and the goal is to determine the feasible regions of bistatic configuration that satisfy the NIS. To solve this problem, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decision space partitioning strategy (DSPS-MOEA) is proposed. It can obtain a set of solutions evenly distributed within the feasible region of the NIS, so as to describe the boundary of the feasible region. The appropriate configuration can thus be selected from the feasible region according to the actual environment and flight constraints for a real imaging mission."

    "abstract": "Rainwater harvesting (RWH) can assist in securing a valuable supplementary resource to mitigate water scarcity. The effectiveness of RWH systems depends significantly on the appropriate placement of RWH structures. However, identifying suitable sites effectively over large areas remains a challenge. Traditionally, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used as a decision support system for RWH site selection. However, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) techniques in this domain. This study examines if ML methods can enhance RWH site identification, particularly check dams in the Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu, India, using high-resolution geospatial data. The biophysical variables considered include elevation, geology, geomorphology, soil, land use and land cover, slope, and annual streamflow. Three ML models—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)—were trained and tested using a dataset of 450 ground-verified RWH locations across two distinct cases: Case I using the original dataset, and Case II incorporating 232 additional unsuitable locations. Model performance was evaluated based on overall accuracy (OA) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) score. While all ML models produced comparable suitability maps, limited training data for unsuitable sites in Case I resulted in large false positives (F P ), especially for SVM and KNN. Case II showed substantial improvements in accuracy and spatial predictions, particularly in identifying suitable zones along stream networks. Compared to AHP, the ML models achieved higher overall accuracy and Cohen’s κ score. This study demonstrates the efficacy of ML algorithms in integrating geospatial and ground-truth data for RWH site selection, offering a scalable and data-driven approach. It also highlights the implications on the quality of training data that can significantly impact the performance of ML approaches applied to RWH siting, particularly when the number of training data points is limited."

    "abstract": "Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a crucial vegetation parameter that determines the efficiency of sunlight absorption and utilization by leaves. It is closely related to the biological and physical processes of vegetation. The acquisition methods for LAI include ground measurement and remote sensing inversion. Remote sensing inversion, as a significant means for large-scale monitoring, holds great significance for the evaluation of global LAI remote sensing products. In this study, we selected the Yucheng Farmland Ecological Station in Shandong Province and utilized Sentinel-2 satellite data to retrieve LAI. When implementing the inversion process with the PROSAIL model as the theoretical basis, the traditional algorithmic approach generally requires iterative estimations of multiple biophysical parameters. This relatively complex parameter retrieval mechanism may result in suboptimal computational performance and a relatively high demand for computing resources. Therefore, we constructed a Sentinel-2 LAI batch inversion algorithm centered on the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) hybrid model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This algorithm initially simulates Sentinel-2 L1C-level data using the PROSAIL model and processes it with the 6SV model. Subsequently, the GPR model is optimized and trained using active learning technology. Finally, batch inversion is achieved through steps such as image processing and data extraction. By comparing the ground-measured LAI data with the inversion results and evaluating them using the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, MAE, RMSE, and EE, the results indicate that the Sentinel-2 LAI inverted from March to December 2020 shows good consistency and periodicity with the ground-measured values. The R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, value reached 0.805, the RMSE was 0.55, and the MAE was 0.46. Compared with the inversion results of the PROSAIL model, the difference values between the two LAI pixel maps are concentrated between -0.092 and 0.165. This suggests that the batch inversion algorithm can efficiently and accurately obtain LAI data and has high consistency with traditional methods, providing powerful support for vegetation research."

    "abstract": "Migratory birds face immense challenges while migrating long distances across countries in their pathways as well as in their destination site. Due to increasing human population, urbanization, anthropogenic activities and changing climate, the migration route of the birds are affected, thereby influencing the pattern of migraton. India is home to many migratory birds, various birds visit India throughout the year. India particularly has 3 major seasons namely summer, monsoon and winter. Therefore, one migratory bird for each season is considered for better analysis of changing climatic conditions. The birds are Blue-tailed Bee- eater (Merops philippinus – summer migrant), Jacobin cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus – monsoon migrant) and Rosy starling (Pastor roseus – winter migrant). This study projects probable habitat distribution in current and future climatic conditions under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) i.e. SSP 126, 245, 370 and 585. To predict the habitat suitability, different AI/ML algorithm was run and based on the ROC plots and AUC values, random forest (RF) algorithm was selected to perform the further analysis. First the model is run to predict the current suitable habitat areas for all three birds. Then its run for all four future scenarios using ACCESS-ESM1-5 modeled CMIP future data for the years (2041-60, 2061-80, 2081-100). In this study its found that the suitable habitat of Clamator jacobinus seems to shift towards the southern part of India in future climatic conditions, under different SSP’s. Similarly for the winter migrant to India i.e Pastor roseus the suitable habitat area appears to be decreased in future indicating rise in temperature. But negligible change is observed in suitable area for the summer migrant Merops philippinus. By examining the spatial distribution of suitable habitats for key migratory species, the study seeks to provide insights into the potential risks and opportunities for conservation planning in the face of climate change."

FNet leverages the Fourier transform to extract low- and high-frequency features and constrains the outputs of different features, enabling semi-supervised training, which can greatly reduce the dependence on labeled data. In addition, we established a dataset of urban villages in Guangzhou. Experimental results demonstrate that FNet is highly competitive in recognizing urban villages in both semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings. This study not only advances the efficient identification of urban villages, but also highlights the potential of frequency information in remote sensing image analysis."

However, silicon carbide metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (SiC MOSFETs) are subject to coupling failure modes in the PCTs due to the instability of the gate structure. This digest focuses on the failure mechanism analysis of SiC MOSFETs with different gate structures in the PCTs: trench gate structure and planar gate structure. Temperature calibration of SiC MOSFETs with different gate structures is performed and the effects of gate structure on the PCTs are quantified.

Using the IPMSM voltage equations, the d- and q-axis flux linkages and inductances are computed while accounting for temperature-dependent resistance variations. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is then employed to interpolate and extrapolate flux values over an extended operating range, ensuring accurate LUT generation. The final flux and inductance LUTs are formatted for direct integration into electric machine emulators, enabling real-time validation and optimisation of electric drive control strategies.

This can be a limitation in practical remote sensing applications, where accurate alignment is necessary for downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we focus on onboard computing contexts, where computational and memory resources are constrained. We introduce a registration module that reuses encoder components of a CD model, avoiding the introduction of significant additional parameters. Instead of dense keypoint predictions, which are often computationally expensive, our approach identifies key patches to predict a transformation matrix, leveraging a sparse cross-attention to manage modality differences. We evaluated the trade-offs between performance and efficiency under affine distortions prevalent in remote sensing imagery and provided insights into the limits of registration accuracy and robustness in resource-constrained environments."

This study introduces a stratified intensity correction approach to mitigate the overlap striping effect commonly observed in multispectral ALS point clouds. By integrating an octree-based region-growing algorithm with an iterative weighted least squares regression, our approach effectively segments the multispectral ALS point clouds into homogeneous regions, thereby enhancing the consistency of intensity values across overlap scans after applying intensity correction to each identified homogeneous region. We conduct a comparative analysis using a multispectral ALS dataset and evaluate the coefficient of variation (cv) in two distinct areas across three channels. Our method demonstrates a reduction of cv by 1.4–9%, indicating improved stability and reliability. These results suggest that our approach not only visually reduces striping effect but also enhances the data quality of multispectral ALS data for environmental monitoring and resource management."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present and experimentally verify a method based on the adaptive matrix block weighting (AMBW) algorithm to achieve large-strain measurement in long-distance, high-spatial-resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR) systems. The system generates two-dimensional (2D) cross-correlation images representing strain information by calculating cross-correlations between the reference signals (RS) and measurement signals (MS) for each segment of the sensing fiber, thereby determining the strain distribution along the fiber. In practical applications, however, strain-induced stretching causes spatial misalignment between the measurement and reference signals. Consequently, the cross-correlation images become contaminated with bad points and outliers, leading to a significant reduction in measurement accuracy. To mitigate the above effects and enhance measurement accuracy, we employ the AMBW method to process the 2D cross-correlation images. Unlike conventional image denoising techniques such as Wiener filtering (WF), Gaussian filtering (GF), and median filtering (MF), the AMBW algorithm leverages both the redundancy and inherent correlation within the 2D cross-correlation data by adaptively adjusting the size of the matrix blocks used in similarity weighting based on the spatial distribution of local outliers. This adaptive capability allows it to effectively eliminate bad points and outlier. Experimental results show that the proposed method accurately measures strain gradients from 500μϵ to 5500μϵ with a spatial resolution of 2 mm, operating at a wavelength scanning rate of 10 nm/s over a 56 m sensing fiber. The proposed approach offers an effective solution for long-distance, high-spatial-resolution, large-strain measurement in OFDR systems, underscoring its strong potential and practical value."

However, their use has not been extended to producing detailed and interpretable Android malware analysis reports. This study integrates LLMs into Android malware analysis by creating a dataset for instruction tuning and fine-tuning the Qwen-7B model using the LoRA method. The model MalQwen is developed by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-7B with 489 malware samples containing decompiled code and expert-labeled security reports. MalQwen outperforms models like Gemini and LLaMA, achieving a BERTscore of 0.84 for SMS malware and a Perplexity score of 3.30 for Scareware. These findings confirm MalQwen’s superior performance in generating precise malware reports, validating LLMs as a powerful new method for Android malware analysis."

Crucially, FL cuts communication overhead, an essential benefit in bandwidth-limited IoT environments. However, repeated gradient exchanges between edge clients (e.g., sensors, mobile devices) and the central server expose vulnerabilities to gradient leakage attacks (GLAs), allowing adversaries to reconstruct private training data from shared gradients. While various gradient protection strategies, such as differential privacy, sparsification, and clipping, have been introduced to mitigate this risk, most existing GLAs are designed for specific protection schemes and fail under heterogeneous deployments. In this work, we propose a unified GLA framework that targets diverse gradient protection techniques in FL systems. Our approach tackles two core challenges: (i) aligning protected gradients with their raw counterparts to enable robust feature extraction, and (ii) identifying critical features for efficient and accurate data reconstruction.We introduce a Taylor-based gradient approximation method for alignment and design a feature reconstructor that enhances both performance and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across various FL scenarios demonstrate the framework’s superior reconstruction capability under different protection schemes, emphasizing the need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms in IoT networks."

Existing clustering-based methods, constrained by their heavy dependence on color features, frequently produce unreliable pseudo-labels that ultimately limit model performance. To overcome these limitations, we present Segment Anything Model-based Semantic-Interactive Clustering Optimization (SAM-SICO), a novel framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model’s semantic segmentation capability with adaptive clustering optimization for weakly-supervised person search. Our framework harnesses the representational power of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enable detector-free semantic feature learning while significantly improving clustering precision. The proposed solution makes three key advances: the Semantic Contour Embedding (SCE) module leverages SAM’s zero-shot segmentation capability to produce highly accurate human body masks; the Relation-driven Semantic Feature Interaction (RSFI) mechanism effectively mitigates clothing-color bias through innovative dynamic affinity matrix construction across multiscale semantic masks and visual features; and the Adaptive Clustering Optimization (ACO) algorithm introduces parameter adaptation to optimize intra-class compactness and inter-class separation metrics.

    "abstract": "In smart cities, real-time monitoring of patients’ health conditions is crucial for ensuring timely interventions. However, due to the extensive geographical coverage required, manually tracking patients’ conditions poses significant challenges. To address this issue, Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) networks have been developed to facilitate data transmission. However, given the limited availability of base stations and various signal issues, maintaining optimal wireless performance in H-IoT networks remains a significant challenge. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes a message-passing neural network algorithm to determine a near-optimal user assignment strategy within the H-IoT network. By leveraging the graphical representation of message passing and the aggregation-update mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs), the proposed algorithm effectively combines both the network model and historical data to optimize decision-making. Unlike conventional GNN-based methods, which either treat user assignment as a black-box regression problem or require centralized training with complex constraints, the proposed algorithm introduces a hybrid architecture that exchanges small-sized messages iteratively and subsequently optimizes via a graph-based rule. The objective function of the proposed algorithm is clearly defined as a nonlinear problem, which is subsequently derived mathematically via the message-passing rule to find an autonomous decision. The solid mathematical formulation and hybrid algorithm enhance scalability, improve interpretability, and support distributed operations with minimal communication overhead. Consequently, the proposed algorithm achieves near optimal performance while maintaining low computational complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional methods in terms of different user and cell sizes, adaptability to varying base station power transmission, robustness in diverse wireless pathloss environments, and computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the “higher-order” means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs."

One of the challenges for ML models, however, is their reliance on the abundance of high quality data. Specifically for localization, a significant challenge is to obtain training data that ''covers'' the entire landscape, in order to ensure a high accuracy for the ML approaches. This issue is compounded when trying to localize multiple transmitters. To address this problem, we introduce a new data augmentation pipeline, termed Physics-informed Augmentation and RF Modeling (PhARMNet), that can combine existing data with a physics-based simulation model, producing a larger dataset with an improved coverage of the landscape of interest. Our results show that PhARMNet offers significant advantages over traditional path loss models. For localization, we demonstrate that augmenting training data with PhARMNet-produced samples improves localization accuracy, particularly in out-of-distribution regions and multi-transmitter settings."

Traditional methods often face challenges due to noise and outliers in intercepted signal sequences. This article proposes a novel two-stage self-supervised framework to predict pulse repetition interval (PRI) sequences of MFR signals, consisting of a preprocessing stage and a prediction stage. The preprocessing stage employs robust enhanced trend filtering (RETF) and interpolation to reconstruct the PRI pattern of the MFR signal sequence. In the prediction stage, the reconstructed PRI sequence is fed into a segment recurrent neural network (SegRNN) model, trained in a self-supervised manner, to generate predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances PRI prediction accuracy, outperforming existing algorithms even under non-ideal conditions."

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the tunability of RFETs allows for parameter adjustment at runtime.

This paper investigates the challenges associated with a hybrid load–generation site comprising offshore wind farms (OWFs), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and hydrogen production units, with a focus on its impact on grid compliance. The study begins with a detailed numerical modelling of the entire hybrid site in PSCAD, incorporating real-world technologies such as Siemens-Gamesa wind turbines, ABB eStorage Max-STPP BESS and Siemens Silyzer 300 electrolyser systems to ensure accurate representation of industrially deployed components. The proposed hybrid site includes a 1.2 GW OWF, a 400 MW BESS, and a 400 MW electrolyser plant, all operating behind a single 400 kV grid connection point. Scenario-based simulations reveal several critical challenges associated with the operation of hybrid load–generation sites. These include the slow dynamics of electrolysers, high reactive power requirements from transmission infrastructure, and constraints in fault ride-through performance. To address these issues, potential mitigation solutions are thoroughly analysed and evaluated. The findings, verified through PSCAD simulations, provide a comprehensive understanding of regulatory compliance in large-scale hybrid energy systems and present practical recommendations for the development of future grids."

    "abstract": "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), with its powerful observation capability, is naturally suited for celestial radar observation tasks. Due to FAST’s inability to transmit signals, we utilize Sanya Incoherent Scatter Radar (SYISR) as the transmitting radar to form a bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system with FAST. However, the non-cooperative relationship between the transmitting and receiving radars introduces complex system errors, such as clock synchronization errors and radar pointing errors. These errors result in significant motion through range cells even after motion compensation based on range curves calculated by ephemeris, leading to severe defocusing. To address this issue, this paper proposes a motion compensation method based on Beetle Antennae Search Algorithm (BAS). The method models the range curve as a 5th-order polynomial and employs image entropy as the objective function. By leveraging BAS’s global optimization capability, it adaptively optimizes range curve parameters, effectively improving compensation accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate that this method can effectively overcome the impact of bistatic SAR system errors and significantly enhance image quality, providing technical support for FAST’s participation in radar celestial exploration missions."

This paper models and analyzes the detection capability of PMMW imaging for civil aircraft at multiple distances and angles under different flight altitudes and observation angles through computational simulation. The raytracing method is used to simulate PMMW imaging in typical observation scenarios. The simulation results reveal the influence of observation distance and pitch angle on the brightness temperature difference.

Their propagation in snow is affected by snow's physical properties, which modulate the microwave signal and enable it to carry information about the snow layer. The L-band microwave radiative transfer model is the foundation for the retrieval of snow depth on Arctic multiyear sea ice. In this study, the snow depth on Arctic multiyear ice is retrieved based on Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT). First, the key process of forward simulation is improved to enhance the accuracy. Then the snow depth retrieval algorithm combining L-band model with radar altimeter data is selected, and the feasibility of applying the improved SMRT model to the multi-year ice snow depth retrieval is verified. Finally, the average monthly snow depth from January to March of each year between November 2012 and April 2021 has been analyzed. The comparison between the retrieval results and the snow depth product indicates that the algorithm used in this study is more effective in determining the distribution of snow depth in the Arctic. The verified result using Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) data from 2013 to 2015 shows that the retrieval snow depths are in good agreement with OIB data, with a RMSE of 0.07m. This indicates the validity of the snow depth retrieval algorithm on Arctic multi-year ice based on the SMRT model."

To overcome the limitations, a cross-modal efficient attention segment model (CEASeg) for RS images is designed. CEASeg first extracts multi-level features through a well-designed dual-branch network. Next, we design two efficient blocks for cross-modal fusion. The attention-based cross-modal fusion block (ACMFusion) can learn feature correlations between two modalities and perform weight up-sampling, while the partial cross-attention fusion block (PCAFusion) emphasizes the global interaction information of deep features. The promising experimental results on two datasets show that CEASeg outperforms the state of the art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Target detection, as a research hotspot in the field of remote sensing image processing, plays a crucial role in applications such as environmental protection and military reconnaissance, in terms of reliability, speed, and accuracy. However, target detection techniques based on a single data source face the issue of a high false detection rate. Multi-source remote sensing image fusion technology is an important means of obtaining high-quality feature observation data. Compared to a single sensor, this technology overcomes limitations in observation content and data acquisition time, enabling more accurate interpretation of the observation scene. It not only improves the quality of the image and the visualization effect, but also enhances the target information, thus improving the accuracy of subsequent target detection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a target enhancement detection method based on the fusion of optical and SAR images. This method enhances scene detail information using optical images and improves the scattering feature information, such as geometry, material, and spatial distribution characteristics of the target using SAR images. The effectiveness of the fused-image target recognition method is demonstrated through the example of oil tank identification. Experimental results show that the method effectively reduces false detections of oil tank targets and overcomes the limitations of using single optical or SAR images for target detection. In terms of mAP50 metrics, the method shows an improvement of 0.3% and 31.7% compared to models trained with optical and SAR images alone, respectively. Furthermore, this model can be extended and applied to other target recognition studies based on the fusion of multi-source remote sensing images, thereby improving target detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) based synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted perturbations can mislead predictions on clean images. A universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) is a single perturbation that can cause the target model to misclassify most images when applied to images in a dataset. This property makes it highly relevant to real-world application scenarios. However, existing UAP generation methods rarely consider SAR’s unique imaging characteristics, leaving room for improvement. In this paper, a feature enhancement strategy-based universal adversarial perturbation named FES-UAP is proposed, which is designed specially for SAR images. Before the generation of UAP, augmentation of the SAR scattering features is conducted to improve its performance. The enhancement strategy amplifies the weak scattering features of the SAR images while preserving the main scattering features. Moreover, over-fitting can be prevented by the random rotation of the original images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher transferability without prior knowledge of original data. Furthermore, the introduced method maintains high transferability under limited data conditions."

    "abstract": "Treatment adherence is critical to the success of tuberculosis (TB) therapy, particularly during the initial intensive phase. However, traditional and digital adherence tools such as SMS reminders, Video-Observed Therapy (VOT), and Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) face several limitations, including scalability issues, high costs, lack of environmental monitoring, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a low-cost, IoT-enabled smart drug dispenser that integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, and a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor to ensure both environmental compliance and scheduled medication delivery. The system interfaces with a web-based application developed using PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP, allowing healthcare providers to remotely monitor environmental conditions and adherence data. Calibration tests demonstrated that the DHT22 sensor met World Health Organization (WHO) standards after humidity offset correction. Functional testing yielded $100 \\%$ dispensing accuracy with a timing deviation of only one second. Designed with affordability (costing under USD ${\\$}$100) and energy efficiency (estimated 387-day battery) in mind, the system operates on minimal power, making it suitable for low-and middle-income countries. This integrated platform supports real-time monitoring, improves treatment reliability, and enhances pharmaceutical integrity, offering a scalable solution aligned with WHO’s goals to minimize TB treatment default and reduce the emergence of drug-resistant strains."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral video data, with its high spectral resolution and unified imaging and spectroscopy, holds great potential for fine-grained object recognition and tracking. However, traditional hyperspectral imaging sensors are large in size and heavy in weight, hindering the integration on small platforms. Moreover, high spectral similarity exists between adjacent narrow-band video frames, leading to significant information redundancy. Based on a spectral adaptive imaging model, this paper proposes a task-solving framework for typical video object tracking. By establishing an imaging quality index evaluation criterion and time constraints, the proposed method can adaptively select the optimal detection and tracking band from spectral video data. The paper conducted experimental validation and analysis on multiple hyperspectral object tracking videos. Results show the proposed spectral band adaptive video object tracking method can screen out the optimal spectral detection and tracking narrow band. The method proposed in this paper can effectively improve processing and analysis efficiency and reduce data acquisition cost, facilitating the design of a simplified spectral imaging detection system."

    "abstract": "Landslide, as one of the most numerous and frequent geological disasters, often brings huge loss of life and property to the people, so landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is very important. At present, graph convolutional network (GCN) has become an important tool to improve LSM model because of its ability to process graph structure data effectively. However, GCN has the problem of high computation and memory consumption when processing large-scale graph data. To overcome this problem, a dual-superpixel graph convolutional network (DSGCN) based on superpixel segmentation is proposed. The model uses the SLIC algorithm to perform superpixel segmentation on the image, and then performs convolution and feature fusion both within and between the superpixels, thus effectively reducing the computational complexity and making full use of the spatial relations inside the superpixel. The experimental results show that DSGCN model has significant advantages in landslide susceptibility assessment. Compared with traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and densely connected networks (DenseNet), DSGCN performs well on several performance indicators, especially on OA, F1 score, Kappa and AUC. DSGCN is 95.09%, 70.23%, 0.6779 and 0.9932 respectively, which shows its superiority in landslide prediction. It also provides accurate and reliable support for landslide prediction in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) on the Tibetan Plateau is essential for understanding its impacts on regional and global climate dynamics. Remote sensing-based ET algorithms have been widely used, yet each algorithm has uncertainties that result in variability among ET estimates. To incorporate different algorithms based on their applicability, we refined the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework with flexible hybrid statistical distribution assumptions. By determining the optimal distribution of each model and initializing BMA with prior distribution parameters, we merged four widely used ET products to estimate monthly ET over the Tibetan Plateau at a 0.1° spatial resolution from 2007 to 2021. The proposed method effectively integrates multiple ET estimates assessed by in situ measurements. It improved the average correlation coefficient by 12.25% and reduced the average root mean square error by 4.25 mm/month."

    "abstract": "Aircraft detection and recognition in satellite imagery can provide crucial technical support for military and civilian applications such as battlefield early warning and air route control. However, existing methods struggle to meet the high accuracy demands due to the interference from complex scenes, as well as the high intra-class variations and low inter-class differences from the aircraft. To address the above challenges, this work fully exploits the potential of existing detectors and proposes a multi-model ensemble prediction framework for aircraft detection and recognition. Specifically, the complementary strengths of Transformer and CNN architectures are leveraged by incorporating multi-scale image inputs and decision-level fusion. The ensemble prediction mitigates the interference from complex scenes and assists the network in making more accurate decisions. On this basis, the oriented progressive prediction is proposed by cascading multiple prediction stages after the region proposal network for each model, which refines the detection and recognition results. Besides, diverse augmentation strategies are employed to generate various training samples, which enhances the model’s generalization capability. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can improve the mean Average Precision (mAP) by over 10% compared to single-model prediction."

OpenMP's multi-threading capabilities enable simultaneous execution of forward and speculative backpropagation steps, significantly improving training speed. The application is planned for synthesis on a state-of-the-art FPGA to demonstrate its potential for hardware acceleration. Our CPU-based experimental results demonstrate that speculative backpropagation achieves a maximum speedup of 24% in execution time when using a threshold of 0.25, and accuracy remaining within <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3-4 \\%$</tex> of the baseline across various epochs.

Deploying detection models on hardware platforms offers advantages such as low power consumption, real-time processing, and operational stability. However, the increasing complexity of deep learning models poses significant challenges for hardware implementation, while the reduced image resolution needed for rapid detection compromises pixel details, impacting accuracy for small targets. This paper presents a lightweight single-stage detection network, based on the YOLO architecture, optimized for efficient deployment on hardware-limited platforms. The proposed model achieves a 39.2% reduction in parameters, a 33% decrease in GFLOPs, and 34.44% fewer layers, processing images at 3.4ms per frame with only a 3.7% decrease in mAP50. This design ensures compatibility with resource-limited hardware, simplifying the implementation and making it ideal for embedded and edge systems. Balancing speed, accuracy, and efficiency, it excels in real-time ship detection in low-resolution SAR image, making it highly suitable for maritime applications in hardware-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion addresses the challenge of reconstructing High-Resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs) from High-Resolution Multispectral images (HR-MSIs) and Low-Resolution HSIs (LR-HSIs), a critical task given the high costs and hardware limitations associated with acquiring high-quality HSIs. While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) framework designed to enhance cross-domain feature extraction and enable effective feature map reusing. The framework first processes HR-MSI and LR-HSI inputs through specialized subnetworks that mutually enhance each other during feature extraction, preserving complementary spatial and spectral details. At its core, HyFusion utilizes an Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB), which combines shifting-window attention and dense connections to expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing into a coupled network architecture, HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral imaging. Our code will be publicly available."

In this method, the DSM imagery of the point cloud is constructed, and the Laplace operator is used to extract the regions with obvious height variations. Then the KAZE feature extraction algorithm is used to calculate the rotation and scaling matrices, and further generate the registration matrix. Finally, the translation is calculated to realize the point cloud rough registration. In this study, two buildings are used for method validation. The average error is about 0.7m and the average processing time is about 200s.

However, the radar sensors used by TRI often employ large or movable antennas; such sensors are typically expensive and have low flexibility. In recent years, autonomous driving has developed millimeter-wave radar sensors quickly, reducing radar’s hardware cost and size. Multi-input multi-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR), a low-cost and high-flexibility millimeter-wave radar system, can acquire measurements under adverse weather conditions. This study focuses on the dynamic deformation monitoring of a railway bridge in Shenzhen, China, by MIMO-SAR. Results show that dynamic loading displacements of different bridge parts were captured during train passing, with a maximum displacement of 0.6 mm. In addition, the vibration frequency of the bridge displacement was analyzed with feature mode decomposition (FMD). Three feature modes were obtained by applying FMD to the deformation time series. The results demonstrated that the low-cost MIMO-SAR system can precisely measure the dynamic deformation caused by the loadings of the passing trains. An innovative and cost-effective approach to structural health monitoring has been presented in this study, which offers a transformative solution for structural safety and sustainable urban development."

This framework assumes a pair of a patch-sampling HS image and a luminance image as observations, where the resolution of the two images is almost the same. The sampling HS observation has limited spatial information but full-band spectral information, so a desirable HS image can be reconstructed by effectively spreading the spectral information. We also propose a reconstruction method for hyperspectralization. The proposed method evaluates the spatial and spectral piecewise smoothness of an HS image using hybrid spatio-spectral total variation and utilizes the patch-preserving hard constraint to keep the spatial and spectral information included in a luminance image and an HS observation, respectively. In the experiment, we confirmed the reconstruction performance of the proposed method to verify the utility of hyperspectralization. As a result, we illustrated that the proposed method can effectively estimate spectral information of no sampled pixels keeping captured spectral information."

This paper presents a newly compiled VNIR spectral reference library, comprising reflectance spectra of 249 mineral samples over the 350 to 1350 nm wavelength range, which were acquired by the CSIRO from single crystals, crystal aggregates, pulp and rock samples. The collection comprises representatives from the following mineral groups: sulfides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates, phosphates, molybdates/tungstates, nesosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates and phyllosilicates. Many mineral species amongst those mineral groups are host minerals of critical metals, such as Co, Ga, Ge, Sb, Sc, W, and Rare Earth Elements (REE). Importantly, the spectral library also comprises gangue minerals common to the respective commodities, such as iron oxides in regolith-hosted REE-deposits. In addition to the VNIR, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region, between 1300-2500 nm, was also collected and is only provided here for comparison purposes rather than detailed spectral peak assignment/analysis. The validation of the 249 mineral reference reflectance spectra is an ongoing process. Based on completed X-ray diffractometry, the reflectance spectra currently comprise 98 pure mineral species samples, 117 samples that are impure, but where the target minerals form an assemblage with typically associated minerals. Selected samples may require further validation methods, such as scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The reflectance spectra as well as metadata for each sample, such as location and validation, are being made publicly available on https://spectroscopy-dev.csiro.au/reflectance."

    "abstract": "The spatial discretization into traffic analysis zones (TAZs) is a crucial yet often overlooked step in transport systems analysis in an urban area. Beyond general guidelines and case-specific experience, the formulation of an automatic or semiautomatic approach remains an open challenge. Nevertheless, the joint availability of remote sensing images, whose segmentation allows identifying homogeneous regions and separating built and non-built areas, of databases that collect information on the activities performed therein (shops, workplaces, etc.), and of floating car data (FCD) provided by GPS sensors on mobile phones and cars, exhibits a remarkable potential in this framework. This paper introduces a novel method for the automatic definition of traffic analysis zones in urban areas, based on the multimodal fusion of satellite multispectral imagery and ancillary geospatial data (OpenStreetMap, land cover, and FCD) and aimed at maximizing homogeneity within zones and minimizing the number of trips with origin and destination in the same zone. The proposed approach integrates the above data sources to generate a TAZ configuration that can be directly applied in travel demand forecasting models. The methodology was applied to a case study in a neighborhood of Rome, Italy."

    "abstract": "High spatiotemporal resolution weather radar observations are essential for the monitoring, forecasting, early warning, and in-depth investigation of hazardous weather phenomena and their underlying mechanisms. In the context of limited radar observation equipment, leveraging super-resolution algorithms for weather radar data is an effective approach to obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution observations. To this end, we propose an improved spatiotemporal super-resolution algorithm for radar precipitation echoes, termed RadBDG-INL, which integrates bidirectional deformable convolutional GRU with implicit neural representation learning. Leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution data from X-band phased-array radar, the algorithm enhances the spatiotemporal resolution of S-band dual-polarization radar observations, doubling the resolution from 6 minutes and 1000 meters to 3 minutes and 500 meters. Compared to the optical flow method followed by bicubic interpolation, the RadBDG-INL approach achieves improvements of 9.4% in PSNR and 2.54% in SSIM. Additionally, subjective evaluations by meteorological experts indicate that RadBDG-INL demonstrates a noticeable advantage. These results underscore the significant potential of RadBDG-INL for advancing spatiotemporal super-resolution in meteorological radar precipitation echo applications."

The present study focuses on utilizing DWR radial velocity observations to retrieve local wind fields, which play a key role in transporting mass, momentum, and energy across the atmosphere and influencing meteorological processes. The study evaluates the quality of velocity volume processing (VVP) wind profiles and validates them against radiosonde observations and other reanalysis data. VVP is a well-known technique for wind field retrieval, however, it has not been rigorously evaluated over the region of interest, i.e., the southern Pensula, India. The study found that the high conditional number poses significant challenges in retrieving wind with desirable accuracy. Statistical analysis of the quality-controlled winds demonstrates a strong correlation of 0.86 for the U component and 0.77 for the V component between DWR-derived and different sources, with RMSE values of 3.16 m/s and 3.10 m/s, respectively. The study evaluates the reliability of DWR-derived wind profiles as a complementary data source for numerical weather prediction (NWP) applications. This research highlights the potential for enhancing weather forecasting accuracy, especially in areas with limited radiosonde coverage, by providing alternative wind profiles."

    "abstract": "Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery is widely used in land cover classification and target recognition due to its rich scattering information. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary nature of PolSAR data, along with its complex scattering characteristics, makes feature extraction a challenging task. To address this, we propose a novel feature extraction method for PolSAR data based on 2D Compact Variational Mode Decomposition (2D-C-VMD). This approach decomposes the original features into modes with narrow Fourier bandwidths and enhances feature representation by reconstructing each mode using a binary support function. Specifically, 2D-C-VMD is first applied to decompose the PolSAR data, extracting modal components from different frequency ranges. A binary support function is then used to reconstruct each mode, ensuring that each mode contributes to signal reconstruction only within its support region, thus preventing interference between modes.To validate the effectiveness of this method,classification experiments were conducted on Radarsat-2 Flevoland dataset and UAVSAR Yucatan Lake dataset, and the experimental results show that this method can significantly improve the classification accuracy."

The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) offers a low-cost, high-resolution complement to spaceborne datasets and can provide detailed 3D forest structure data. The current study evaluates plot-level AGB estimation using UAV-LiDAR derived height and crown diameter, calibrated GEDI-L4A AGB and GEDI- L2A rh98 heights, and spectral variables from UAV-multispectral and RGB datasets. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the 10 most important predictors were used as predictor variables. In this sense, a random forest (RF) regression model was developed using calibrated AGB and height values and spectral variables from UAV data. The results showed that the model, including calibrated AGB, height, and spectral variables from UAV data, performed best, with training evaluation metrics of R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.95, RMSE = 13.66 Mg/ha, MAE = 6.56 Mg/ha). AGB predictions range between 29 Mg/ha to 303 Mg/ha, with standard errors ranging between 0.17 Mg/ha to 11.1 Mg/ha. This hybrid approach substantially enhances the accuracy of AGB prediction and addresses several uncertainties in AGB modelling. These results provide a robust framework that can be used to improve forest carbon stock assessments, advance global AGB monitoring, and support sustainable forest management and ecological research methodologies."

An interface impedance network with integrated partially-rated power converters is placed between the source and the load, making the overall system a direct single-stage AC/AC converter. Through appropriate design of the impedance network topology and the control system applied to the power converters, it is possible to perform the voltage compensation when the power converters have fractional currents and terminal voltages within acceptable range.

This paper proposes an enhanced thermal stress balancing algorithm using dual-SM selection for the nearest-level PWM. By selecting two SMs for PWM operation, the proposed method ensures that the SM with the lowest temperature is always loaded, thereby enhancing overall thermal stress balancing performance. Additionally, distributing switching losses across two SMs effectively reduces temperature peaks. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation and experimental results."

These issues make it difficult to establish accurate relationships between building components, leading to incorrect reconstruction results. To overcome these challenges, we introduce APC2Building, a completion-based generative geometric reconstruction network, that converts airborne point clouds to buildings. APC2Building utilizes a multi-scale cross-attention mechanism to fill in missing building points. This mechanism leverages the geometric features of building structures to generate a dense point cloud. After that, the network applies skip cross-attention combined with mesh convolution to reconstruct the polygonal mesh model from the completed dense point cloud. Experimental results show that APC2Building significantly improves the quality of reconstructed mesh models. It also outperforms existing methods on a real-world airborne LiDAR building point cloud dataset."

    "abstract": "Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is crucial for marine ecosystems. Traditional L-band microwave radiometers can achieve SSS retrieval by correcting sea surface brightness temperature (BT). However, the calibration process is influenced by various complex factors and cannot be quantified to date. The Spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) can directly reflect changes in sea surface roughness, providing a new method for SSS retrieval. The spaceborne GNSS-R observations of the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) in conjunction with Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) have successfully retrieved SSS. However, in addition to the proven factors such as wind speed and wave height, there are still many potential influencing factors for SSS. Therefore, in this study, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-Transformer fusion model based on BDS-3 and Galileo reflection signal data was proposed to incorporate rainfall and sea surface currents under low to medium wind speeds (<20m/s) into the retrieval. The Tianmu-1 data with global coverage was used to invert global SSS accurately. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between SSS and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data retrieved using the CNN-Transformer fusion model based on BDS-3 reflected signals was as high as 0.87. Compared with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, the retrieval accuracy of BDS and Galileo signals in the proposed model has been improved by 33.45% and 34.64%, respectively. The Bais of the BDS-3 signal retrieval ranges from -0.122 psu to 0.049 psu. The Bais of Galileo signal retrieval ranges from -0.568 psu to -0.202 psu. This provides a reference for the future application of spaceborne GNSS-R in SSS retrieval, especially in complex sea conditions and processing high spatiotemporal complexity data, which has significant advantages."

However, due to the limitation in the platform incident angle, measured SAR images often suffer from insufficient angular coverage, which reduces the robustness of intelligent methods such as neural networks. To effectively augment SAR samples, this paper proposes a differentiable framework for SAR target image generation from novel views. Specifically, the framework utilizes 3D Gaussian distributions and spherical harmonics to represent the target attributes. By leveraging 3D Gaussian splatting, the differentiable framework reconstructs the target scene representation by training on the samples from existing viewing angles. Finally, SAR imaging space transformation and differentiable accumulation are used to render the SAR images from novel views. Experiments conducted on both simulated datasets and MSTAR measured data, along with method comparations, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Recently, multispectral remote sensing has emerged as a promising alternative, offering rich spectral information. However, current multispectral detection methods are hindered by low spatial resolution and the scarcity of comprehensive datasets, leading to reduced detection accuracy and limited applicability. To address these gaps, we present PATROL, the first high-resolution multispectral dataset specifically designed for aerial target detection. Derived from two advanced satellite systems - GFDM and CM-01, PATROL comprises 1,301 high-resolution images with 2-meter ground resolution and 512×512 pixel dimensions, featuring diverse scenarios including varying weather conditions and complex backgrounds, with all targets cross-validated using ADS-B data to ensure annotation accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed detection framework achieves significant improvements over existing methods in challenging conditions. Each target is annotated with precise bounding boxes across all available spectral bands. Our baseline experiments demonstrate that the multispectral nature of PATROL enables more robust detection compared to single-band approaches, achieving up to 8.5% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) under challenging conditions such as low visibility and heavy cloud coverage. The dataset and baseline implementations are publicly available to facilitate future research in aerial target detection.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

By simulating airborne circular scanning SAR images of point targets and ship models, a comparative analysis of the image characteristics under different conditions was conducted. The results illuminated that the w-K full aperture algorithm with fine focus operation had better imaging capability than coarse opaeration."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the directional land surface emissivity (LSE) retrieval from the mid-infrared observations acquired by the advanced MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI-II) on Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) satellite. First, the radiometric calibration biases in the MERSI-II channels 20 (~3.8 pm) and 21 (~4.05 pm) are corrected against the channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua satellite. Then, a method, which combines a cubic split-window method to estimate bi-directional reflectance and the RossThick-LiSparse-R model, is developed to retrieve the directional LSEs from the daytime MERSI-II mid-infrared observations. Next, the directional LSEs in the MERSI-II channels 20 and 21 in July of 2020 over the Eastern Asia (18°N~50°N, 95°E~130°E) are retrieved from the daytime MERSI-II observations. Finally, the results are cross-validated with the MOD11C2 product. The results show that the calibration biases in the MERSI-II channels 20 and 21 are 0.51±0.44 K and -0.33±0.41 K, respectively. The directional LSEs range between 0.75 and 1.0 depending on land cover types. Over the sparsely vegetated and bare areas, where the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is less than or equal to 0.3 (NDVI≤0.3), the LSEs vary from 0.75 to 0.9, and the retrieval errors are about 0.06 against the MOD11C2 product. Over the densely vegetated areas (NDVI>0.3), the LSEs change from 0.9 to 1.0, and the retrieval errors are about 0.004 against the MOD11C2 product."

The method attains an embedding rate of 383.45 bits per second (bps), outperforming several existing techniques in terms of capacity. However, the increased capacity introduces compromises, such as elevated Bit Error Rates (BER) under certain signal processing attacks and decreased imperceptibility, as indicated by a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 21.21 dB. The scheme demonstrates selective robustness, particularly maintaining effectiveness against highrate resampling attacks. This makes it suitable for scenarios where embedding capacity is prioritized over robustness or audio quality. Future enhancements may focus on improving synchronization and perceptual transparency through psychoacoustic modeling or adaptive parameter tuning."

However, the domain adaptation challenge, particularly the domain shift between different geographical regions and sensor types, significantly hinders the widespread application of deep learning models in this field. This study aims to develop an effective domain adaptation approach for landslide detection using the SAMRS (Segment-Anything Model for Remote Sensing) framework. We propose a three-stage methodology: utilizing SAMRS's pre-trained features as the foundation, leveraging its rich geospatial knowledge; implementing a global histogram matching module that aligns feature distributions across domains by matching cumulative distribution functions of RGB channels; and developing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework where the adapted SAMRS model guides a lightweight student network's training on the target domain. Experimental results on various geographical regions and sensor types demonstrate that our approach effectively bridges the domain gap while maintaining high detection accuracy, significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data in target domains. This study provides a practical solution for cross-domain landslide detection in real-world applications."

Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks. The remote accessibility of such critical grid components creates entry points for attacks that adversaries could exploit, posing threats to the stability of the system. To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetrations through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations."

RS-ScaleGAN can learn from one single natural image and generate realistic synthetic data samples. We applied the RS-ScaleGAN generated synthetic image samples in refugee tents detection near the Syrian border and compared the results with the traditional data augmentation methods. Our experiment results show that the RS-ScaleGAN model effectively generates diverse, high-quality remote sensing image samples, and significantly improves the classification model performance compared the the traditional methods.

In this paper, we present FlexBitsSNN, a RISC-V-based general-purpose processor architecture. It incorporates multiple custom extension instructions along with a variable number of timesteps for spike encoding. FlexBitsSNN accelerates inference in both one-dimensional and twodimensional SNN networks. The custom instructions, invoked via inline assembly in C, provide greater flexibility compared to traditional processors and support complex SNN architectures. The FlexBits-SNN processor executes SNN inference tasks with an arbitrary number of timesteps and achieves over a 90% reduction in inference time as compared to conventional RISCV ISA. Performance evaluation under 55 nm CMOS process demonstrates a peak energy efficiency of 6.42 pJ/SOP (Synaptic Operation), highlighting its suitability for efficient SNN inference."

This letter proposes an unsupervised target detection method (U-TDM) based on a complex-valued extreme learning machine (CV-ELM), the essence of which is to transform the target detection problem into a pixel binary classification problem. The SAR image is first divided into several unlabeled patches, and fuzzy c-means (FCM) is used to construct the reference target patch set and the clutter patch set. Based on these two patch sets, CV-ELM is used to classify the neighboring patch of the pixel to be detected. Since the pixel intensity and distribution of target-of-interest and clutter are different, unsupervised pixel classification could be realized without ground-truth through U-TDM. Experimental results on GF-3 data and Sentinel-1 data show the efficiency of the proposed method in target detection with a heterogeneous clutter environment."

This method firstly performs time-frequency analysis on the SAR echo signal, uses Lv’s Distribution to detect and estimate the center frequency and modulation rate of the linear frequency modulation broadband interference signal, then performs pulse compression on the echo signal, converts the broadband interference signal into a narrowband impulse response, uses frequency domain notching to remove broadband interference, and finally performs reverse matched filtering on the signal to obtain the interference suppressed signal. Interference suppression experiments were carried out using the data from the Lutan-1 SAR satellite, which can effectively remove the influence of the linear frequency modulation interference signal, proving the effectiveness of this method."

In this work, an ensemble of deep Koopman models is proposed to reinforce the theoretical foundation of Koopman-based control for induction motors powered by voltage source inverters. The methodology is validated through simulation, with a focus on the selection of measurable state variables and the incorporation of stator flux linkage physics. When trained on sequences of three control vectors, the models achieve accurate predictions of stator current and flux linkage for sequences extending up to 40 control vectors, equivalent to 1 ms into the future. Detailed descriptions and evaluations of torque and stator flux linkage control are provided, yielding mean tracking errors of 1.2% for torque and 0.07% for flux linkage relative to nominal values. The simulation results support the potential of Koopman theory as a robust framework for induction motor linearization, combining the predictive accuracy of deep learning with the stability and interpretability of linear control methods.

Collaboration between drones further enhances the robustness of perception systems. However, existing multi-drone datasets assume fixed swarm formations and constant altitudes, limiting the ability to monitor targets at varying distances. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Altitude Collaborative Perception Dataset (MACP), which facilitates research on high-andlow altitude collaboration by incorporating UAVs at different altitudes. The MACP dataset, generated using the CARLA simulator, includes 24,000 images captured by five drones at altitudes of 30m, 50m, and 70m, observing dynamic targets such as vehicles and pedestrians. Along with the dataset, we propose a novel model that incorporates normalized depth estimation to improve depth accuracy across varying altitudes, leveraging ground priors. Additionally, we introduce a Homologous Point Geometric Consistency Loss (HPGCL) to ensure geometric consistency between homologous points across different views, enhancing 3D object detection. Experimental results on the MACP dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as BEVDet and BEVStereo in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and mean Average Translation Error (mATE). Ablation studies demonstrate that the Perspective Transformation Module (PTM) and HPGCL can significantly improve detection accuracy.

The PDL module integrates training samples from the new task with prototypes from previous tasks to train the classification model, which is then used to learn a prototype for each new class.

In cascaded architectures, downstream converters often act as Constant Power Loads (CPLs), introducing unique challenges that are not adequately captured by traditional dynamic models. While the behavior of SRCs with resistive loads is well understood, modeling SRCs under CPL conditions remains relatively unexplored. This paper presents a unified modeling framework for the SRC-CPL system using the Dynamic Phasor (DP) method. A large-signal model is first developed to capture the system's nonlinear transient and steady-state behavior. Subsequently, small-signal linearization is applied to derive analytical expressions for key transfer functions: control-to-output, audio susceptibility, and output impedance. Conditions for reducing these to canonical forms are provided. The proposed models are validated through circuit simulations and experimental measurements involving a practical, finitebandwidth CPL operating under above-resonance conditions. The results confirm the accuracy of the models and highlight the impact of CPL dynamics on transient performance, offering critical insights for the design and control of resonant converters feeding constant power loads."

MSDGNet comprises three primary modules: the Spectral-Detail-Global (SDG) encoder, the Multi-Scale Attention Feature Fusion (MSAFF) module, and a simple decoder. The SDG encoder captures comprehensive features by focusing on spectral, detail, and global contextual information, enhancing the model’s ability to distinguish complex land cover types and resist noise. The MSAFF module applies a multi-scale attention mechanism to dynamically weight key features across scales, refining the segmentation performance with limited annotation. Experimental results on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Zurich Summer datasets validate the effectiveness of MSDGNet, showing it outperforms other state-of-the-art models in overall accuracy (OA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU). This model offers a practical solution for large-scale remote sensing applications where minimizing annotation costs is essential."

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect unseen objects only relying on few training samples, but low-resource images are hard to provide robust representation for unknown testing scene. There currently exist some works focusing on applying prototype learning to tackle with this challenging task. Nevertheless, prototype learning was always incorporated in FSOD by simple feature weighting during feature extraction, which hampers to fully leverage the categorical discrimination capability of prototype learning. To address this problem, a prototype-learning-based similarity metric decision is applied for FSOD in a single end-to-end training process, namely, Proto-RCNN. Firstly, these object patches from support images are employed for calculating the class prototypes to avoid the inference of complex background. Secondly, the similarity distances between features of potential proposals and the class prototypes are measured for judging the foreground classes. Without any bells and whistles, it has been proven to be very effective by conducting comparison experiments with advanced FSOD detectors."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) identifies targets with unique spectral characteristics without prior knowledge. In recent years, deep learning-driven HAD methods have pushed the boundaries of innovation, yet these models often falter in accurately modeling the background in complex scenes with noise interference, leading to a challenging conflation of anomalies with the background. Moreover, a significant proportion of deep detection models are finely tuned for specific background contexts, thereby exhibiting a constrained ability to generalize in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, this study proposes a frequency domain mask-guided diffusion model (FMDiff). By analyzing amplitude spectrum disparities between anomalies and backgrounds, FMDiff constructs a frequency mask that weights background regions (with values close to 1) and suppresses anomalies (with values close to 0). This mask directs a dual-phase diffusion process: in the forward diffusion, it imposes noise selectively on background pixels; in the reverse phase, serving as a condition for the denoising network to effectively estimate and remove background noise. Experimental results illustrate that FMDiff achieves superior performance and is highly competitive with other sophisticated state-of-the-art methods."

Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale."

    "abstract": "Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is considered a probe of plant photosynthetic activity. Most radiance-based SIF retrieval strategies leverage the oxygen absorption features from different sensor spectral configurations on board various platforms. Atmospheric effects at high altitudes largely influence these oxygen features, necessitating careful atmospheric correction. Existing atmospheric correction methods relying on radiative transfer models (RTM) are mostly applied to upwelling radiance. However, very small pixels/footprints over heterogeneous canopies can violate their assumptions, such as a fully illuminated, homogeneous, and Lambertian surface. Furthermore, upwelling radiance simulation at both canopy and sensor levels is challenging, primarily due to the low reflectance of vegetation in the red spectral region, hindering the accurate retrieval of surface reflectance and SIF. This work proposes using upwelling irradiance at the sensor level to mitigate atmospheric effects in SIF quantification. Upwelling irradiance refers to the downwelling irradiance that reaches a surface with uniform diffuse reflectance and then travels directly upward to the sensor. We hypothesize that upwelling irradiance and radiance (including SIF) experience similar atmospheric influences, enabling effective mitigation of atmospheric effects on SIF retrieval. Upwelling at-sensor irradiance was derived through two methodologies: (1) MODTRAN RTM (E<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sens</inf>) and (2) a ground Lambertian reference target (E<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sens-tar</inf>).

Since synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are unaffected by severe weather, SAR-optical fusion has become a common approach for cloud removal. However, existing methods often struggle to recover high-frequency information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, SARDiff_CR, which integrates diffusion models into a wavelet-based cross-domain fusion Transformer. By utilizing diffusion models in a compact latent space, SARDiff_CR generates high-frequency prior features that align with the ground truth distribution. Experimental results on the globally and seasonally diverse SEN12MS-CR dataset demonstrate that SARDiff_CR significantly outperforms most existing SAR-assisted cloud removal methods."

Methods such as deep learning and computer vision have been widely adopted to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of individual tree crown detection. However, deep learning algorithms require a large number of samples which are time-consuming to obtain by manual selection. Therefore, we aim to use airborne Lidar-based single-tree segmentation to quickly obtain enough training samples, which will then be used as references for the following Deep learning-based individual tree segmentation from VHR aerial images (National Agricultural Imagery Program, NAIP, data, 0.6 m). Meanwhile, a noise filter process was proposed to improve single tree segmentation from LiDAR cloud point data, and the Deep learning algorithm of YOLOv11 instance segmentation model was adopted. Results show that LiDAR-derived single tree segmentation has a relatively high accuracy (F 0.87) and can quickly generate enough training samples. By visual comparison, the canopy edge of LiDAR-derived single trees well matches with the VHR images, except for some areas with a large visual angle in VHR images. As a result, VHR segmentation results show a high precision, with mAP@50 of 0.836. Besides, we found that the deep-learning method is sensitive to the accuracy of reference samples from LiDAR. In conclusion, the proposed process in this study demonstrated the feasibility of integrating LiDAR and VHR images for a rapid and reliable individual tree segmentation, which is practicable for large-scale applications in the future."

The proposed approach instead exploits only one CR and at least two non-coincident parallel SAR acquisitions. It is thus very useful in application scenarios, such as the emergency ones, where the proper deployment of different CRs on the scene to be illuminated, along with the corresponding measurement of their positions, can be difficult.

Current deep learning-based super-resolution approaches encounter challenges, including an insufficient number of training samples, limited generalization capabilities, and overly simplistic degradation assumptions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an unsupervised hyperspectral image super-resolution method, incorporating a blurring kernel estimation based on Gaussian distribution learning. Specifically, An alternating optimization framework for blind HSI SR modeling is proposed, wherein the blurs are approximated using a learning-based approach that leverages randomly generated weighted Gaussian blurs. The HSI images are then estimated using a deep image prior (DIP) network. The proposed method demonstrates a plug-and-play mechanism that addresses HSI SR tasks through the optimization of the DIP network during the process of evaluating solution alternatives, thereby obviating the need for traditional training and reducing data dependency. Extensive simulation results reveal that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in HSI SR tasks, demonstrating enhanced results in most datasets and excellent generalization capabilities across diverse degradation scenarios."

First, by leveraging prompt learning and contrastive learning, unimodal semantic encoders are pre-trained to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations, where each modality serves as a cross-modal prompt for the other. Second, a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanism and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks is designed to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Experimental results demonstrate that ProMSC-MIS substantially outperforms conventional image transmission combined with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Notably, it reduces the required communication cost by 50%–70% at the same segmentation performance, while also decreasing the storage overhead and computational complexity by 26% and 37%, respectively. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training and semantic fusion strategies. Our scheme is highly suitable for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a customized design T-shirt embedded with a porous structured dry electrode for ECG monitoring. The porous electrodes are based on graphene nanoplatelets (GNP-3A) and polyamide 66 (PA66) materials. First, through electrical performance testing, it is demonstrated that the proposed dry electrode has high conductivity, with a skin contact impedance of 17.6 kΩ at 100Hz, significantly lower than commercial Ag/AgCl wet electrodes. In addition, the electrode can accurately capture ECG signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 34.76 dB, which is an 8% improvement over traditional Ag/AgCl wet electrodes. Additionally, the design optimizes wearability by using soft and highly elastic fabric and integrates electrodes using metal snap buttons to reduce the discomfort typically caused by traditional wet electrodes, thereby enhancing comfort during prolonged use. Subsequently, to evaluate the performance improvements of the smart ECG T-shirt in terms of comfort and signal acquisition, a self-constructed ECG monitoring system was used to record single-lead ECG signals from adult males wearing the smart ECG T-shirt, under different motion states such as resting, walking, and jogging. The P-Q-R-S-T characteristic peaks, motion artifacts, and noise were assessed and compared with commercially available ECG monitoring T-shirts. The comparison results indicate that the integrated design of the electrode and T-shirt effectively balances comfort and performance in practical applications, with no skin irritation or discomfort observed during prolonged use. This work offers an innovative and practical solution for daily, comprehensive, wearable, and scalable ECG monitoring, showing great promise for future applications."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a pivotal enabler for 6G and beyond wireless systems owing to its multi-GHz bandwidth. One of its novel applications is in wireless data centers, where it enables ultra-high data rates while enhancing network reconfigurability and scalability. However, due to numerous racks, supporting walls, and densely deployed antennas, the line-of-sight (LoS) path in data centers is often instead of fully obstructed, resulting in quasi-LoS propagation and degradation of spectral efficiency. To address this issue, Airy beam-based hybrid beamforming is investigated in this paper as a promising technique to mitigate quasi-LoS propagation and enhance spectral efficiency in THz wireless data centers. Specifically, a cascaded geometrical and wave channel model (CGWCM) is proposed for quasi-LoS scenarios, which accounts for diffraction effects while being more simplified than conventional wave-based model. Then, the characteristics and generation of the Airy beam are analyzed, and beam search methods for quasi-LoS scenarios are proposed, including hierarchical focusing-Airy beam search, and low-complexity beam search. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CGWCM and demonstrate the superiority of the Airy beam over Gaussian beams in mitigating blockages, verifying its potential for practical THz wireless communication in data centers."

However, conventional control methods face difficulties in fully optimizing the compensation performance of energy storage systems while ensuring system stability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an improved adaptive control method. By integrating a voltage outer-loop adaptive algorithm with second-order frequency division technology, the proposed approach effectively suppresses DC bus voltage fluctuations and achieves notable capacity savings in HESS under identical compensation conditions. Bode diagram analysis demonstrates that the improved adaptive algorithm exhibits higher phase margins compared to conventional control methods, thereby significantly enhancing system stability. Furthermore, based on simulation results, this study establishes a control-in-the-loop experimental validation platform. The experimental results confirm that the proposed control method delivers substantial improvements in both HESS capacity configuration and system stability, verifying its effectiveness in practical applications."

In this manner, drones, as flying smart nodes in the wireless network ecosystem, facilitate diverse applications, such as industrial, civilian, and disaster response operations. However, the widespread adoption of drone networks introduces significant challenges regarding interoperability, privacy, and security. Advances in quantum computing exacerbate these issues by rendering classical cryptographic measures inadequate, necessitating the adoption of quantum-safe approaches. Existing solutions fail to address all potential threats or lack post-quantum security. This work sets out to propose a robust lattice-based authentication and communication protocol for drone networks, addressing these challenges. The protocol integrates dynamic credentials, timestamps, multi-factor authentication, and context information to enhance security. The scheme's security is analyzed using the DY and BPR models and formally verified via the AVISPA tool. Performance evaluations and comparisons with existing solutions demonstrate the protocol's functionality, showcasing a reasonable trade-off between security and performance. By leveraging modern cryptographic techniques, the proposed scheme ensures reliable and robust drone operations, effectively mitigating various attacks beyond session establishment while safeguarding privacy, and supporting dynamic network events."

Passive vision sensors offer a low-cost, lightweight solution for real-time terrain analysis and 3D scene reconstruction, making them ideal for onboard systems. We introduce OR-SLZNet, an original deep learning model based on ordinal regression to predict SLZs from UAV imagery. Unlike prior approaches, OR-SLZNet produces dense, multi-level safety maps by jointly leveraging photometric (e.g., color and texture) and geometric cues (e.g., flatness, slope, and depth), assigning each pixel an ordinal safety score that reflects landing suitability. With real-time inference (~0.02s/frame), the model supports onboard deployment and rapid decision-making in time-critical situations. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets demonstrate OR-SLZNet effectiveness and strong generalization across a wide range of structural complexities.

    "abstract": "Current housing price prediction (HPP) models face difficulties in identifying and explaining the causal impact of multidimensional societal factors. Existing statistical and deep-learning approaches rely heavily on correlation-based modeling, which limits their interpretability and adaptability to dynamic urban conditions. To address this gap, this study proposes an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent framework that integrates a cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) ontology with a Structural Causal Model (SCM) for intelligent societal factor selection and interpretable housing price prediction. AI agents operate through a self-adaptive cycle of perception, causal reasoning, and iterative learning. The CPSS ontology organizes complex societal variables into six core dimensions, enabling structured causal analysis, whereas SCM performs Bayesian-network-based factor screening. The selected factors are then used in an XGBoost model to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. The proposed CPSS-SCM framework provides quantitative evidence of the varying impacts of societal factors across urban environments, supporting transparent and region-specific real estate market analyse. Experiments conducted on 23,901 real estate transaction records from four districts in Taipei demonstrated significant improvements over traditional housing-factor-only models: the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreased by 5%, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was reduced by 11%, and the coefficient of determination (R²) score improved by 4%. The R² score consistently remained between 0.92 and 0.93 across districts, indicating excellent robustness. This integration represents a novel causal–predictive pipeline that improves both model transparency and predictive robustness in urban analytics."

Five cross-cutting gaps emerge: label scarcity, adversarial evasion, real-time scalability, behavioral ambiguity, and multi-chain visibility.

Their impact extends into emerging domains like the Internet of Things (IoT), where AI-generated code increasingly drives edge device behavior and smart system integration. However, LLMs often inherit and propagate biases present in their training data. These biases can surface in AI-generated code, leading to ethically problematic, algorithmically skewed, or even unsafe outcomes—particularly concerning in safety-critical and socially sensitive IoT environments. This research investigates bias in LLM-generated code and proposes a multi-faceted approach combining Contextual Code Analysis, Counterfactual Prompt Engineering, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to detect and mitigate such biases. We show how these techniques reveal hidden biases in naming conventions, decision logic, and coding patterns, and demonstrate how RLHF can reduce bias at scale while preserving functionality – achieving a 49% reduction. in bias across evaluated benchmarks. Our findings emphasize the need for rigorous bias evaluation frameworks, careful data curation, and transparent development workflows. The tradeoff between bias reduction and code precision is explored, with implications for the ethical use of AI in IoT systems and other high-stakes software contexts. Further research is encouraged in hybrid debiasing techniques, intersectional bias identification, energy-efficient modeling, and the development of standardized ethical coding practices."

The interaction force constraint is interpreted as a new force-constrained control barrier function (FC-CBF) by exploiting the generalized contact model with the prior information of the environment, e.g., the prior stiffness, for robot kinematics. The difference between the real environment and the generalized contact model is approximated by constructing an uncertainty observer, and its estimation error is quantified on the basis of Lyapunov theory. By interpreting strict interaction safety specifications as a dynamic constraint and restricting the desired joint angular velocities in kinematics, the proposed approach modifies nominal compliant controllers using quadratic programming, ensuring adherence to interaction force constraints in partially uncertain environments. The strict force constraint and the stability of the closed-loop system are rigorously analyzed. Experimental tests using a UR3e industrial robot with different environments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving the force constraints."

This study proposes a new BCI application approach and develops an accurate decoding model targeted at urination and defecation motor attempt tasks. Specifically, we designed a Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (UDCNN-BiTCN) to decode both the suppressed urination and defecation (S-UD) task and the urination and defecation (UD) task. Seventy-one participants (including 44 healthy controls and 27 SCI patients) were recruited for the experiment. The results showed that UDCNN-BiTCN achieved an average accuracy of 91.47% on the S-UD task and 91.81% on the UD task. The study also conducted within-subject cross-task transfer learning and cross-subject experiments, further validating the superiority of the model. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of this new paradigm from the perspective of classification performance. The research approach and findings in this study provide a valuable new perspective for BCI applications in the recovery of urinary and defecation functions."

As a compensation for the incompletion of the profile, a limited amount of scattering/prescribed data are provided, which in principle contain sufficient information associated with the missing part of the profile. The existing solvers can hardly solve this type of problems. On one hand, the well-developed forward solvers have no mechanism to accept the scattering data to recover the unknown part of the profile. On the other hand, the existing solvers for inverse problems cannot retrieve the complete profile with an acceptable accuracy from the limited amount of scattering data, even when the available part of the profile can be fed into the solvers. To overcome the difficulty, the EM forward scattering from an incompletely known dielectric scatterer is derived in this work. A deep learning scheme is then developed where the forward and inverse scattering problems can be solved simultaneously. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DL-based scheme in terms of two-dimensional (2-D) EM scattering problems."

While existing transformer-based methods excel in capturing global context, they often fail to maintain robust long-range semantic dependencies across input correspondences. To address this, we propose a novel correspondence pruning transformer network, called CPFormer-Net, which enhances long-range dependency modeling via structured context aggregation for accurate correspondence pruning. Specifically, we propose the CPFormer module, which integrates global context with local geometric cues to ensure both structural coherence and semantic consistency. Then, we propose the Semantic Graph Network (SEGN) module with a dual-branch architecture to improve representation. One branch applies Structured Context Aggregation (SCA) block with an agent attention mechanism to explicitly model long-range dependencies, enabling it to filter channels, recalibrate features, and guide attention, while the other branch employs pooling and normalization to preserve spatial relations. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrate that CPFormer-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inlier identification and correspondence matching."

However, existing methods generally follow the closed-set setting, assuming that unlabeled samples do not contain novel classes, which is hard to hold in practical applications. This paper aims to study semi-supervised HSI classification in the open-set setting, i.e., unlabeled samples fall into novel classes, and proposes a class-aware consistency learning (CACL) method. First, to explore discriminative spectral-spatial features, a position-aware transformer is developed, which effectively models spatial position priors between the center pixel and its neighboring pixels via a symmetric position-aware encoding. Then, to reduce the interference from novel class samples on the model’s discrimination, a prototype-driven consistency learning is proposed, which accurately selects unlabeled samples belonging to known classes via a known class sampler, and efficiently utilizes their spectral-spatial information by modeling consistent predictions across different views. Finally, to further improve the distinguishability between known classes, a prototype contrastive optimization is proposed to decrease the distance between samples from the same class and increase the distances between those from different classes in the feature domain. Furthermore, an adaptive segmentation threshold is designed to accurately predict known classes and reject novel classes. Extensive experiments verify that our CACL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving the overall accuracy of 81.65%, 88.61%, and 92.88% on the Indian Pines, Salinas, and Pavia University datasets, with 10 labeled samples in each known class.

    "abstract": "Oriented to low-altitude economy, integrated air-ground-space communication system and ultra-dense mobile communication network access, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces-mounted unmanned aerial vehicle (RIS-UAV) offer a dynamic solution for propagation challenges in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. This work aims to present a comprehensive analytical framework for RIS-UAV assisted mmWave communications in multiple scenarios, encompassing single-base station single-user terminal (SBSU), single-base station multi-user terminal (SBMU), multi-base station single-user terminal (MBSU), and multi-base station multi-user terminal (MBMU) scenarios. We first establish path-loss models and flexible beam management considering UAV translational and rotational posture movements separately within the SBSU scenario. For multi-user scenarios, we propose a space division multiple access (SDMA) over RIS scheme leveraging RIS element partitioning. For multi-base station scenarios, a mobile RIS-UAV phase coordination (MRUPC) strategy is proposed, utilizing the controlled mobility of the UAV to simplify phase compensation requirements for signals from multiple base stations. Extensive numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the derived path-loss model and the feasibility of the proposed beam management scheme for each scenario. The results demonstrate that SDMA over RIS effectively achieves multi-user mmWave beamforming. In addition, the proposed MRUPC strategy exhibits substantial performance gains (approx. 6-8 dB) over the static scheme in the MBSU scenario, validating the feasibility and superiority of leveraging UAV mobility for multi-base station coordination. This study comprehensively provides a systematic theoretical foundation and physical-layer solutions for the design and flexible deployment of joint RIS-UAV mmWave systems in complex wireless access scenarios."

    "abstract": "The stability of modern power grids is increasingly dependent on the performance of grid-forming converters. The Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM) has emerged as a key technology to guarantee grid support. However, its reliability is critically challenged by system uncertainties, such as wrong grid impedance estimation and interactions between neighboring converters. Recent studies have applied the μ-analysis to assess the Virtual Synchronous Compensator (VSG) robust stability. However, the superior robustness offered by the Virtual Synchronous Compensator (VSC) approach has not been investigated in literature. This paper fills this gap by presenting a robust stability analysis that highlights the benefits of the VSC over the VSG. The VSC hybrid structure, which separates power management from dynamic grid support, inherently shows higher robustness to system uncertainties. The paper highlights this advantage using the μ-analysis and proposes a methodology for its experimental validation. Theoretical and experimental tests reveal the VSC enhanced performance: it maintains stability for up to a tenfold increase in grid impedance, while the VSG fails at a sevenfold increase. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that in systems with multiple converters, the VSC mode enhances the overall system robustness compared to the VSG, making it a more reliable solution for future power systems."

    "abstract": "Sliding mode control (SMC) is widely used in the servo system of permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) and the problem of speed constraint exists in conventional sliding mode position controller (SMPC). The position speed integrated sliding mode controller (PSISMC) is an effective method to constrain speed for SMC due to its advantages of fast response and safety. However, the cascaded sliding mode surface structure of PSISMC makes the sliding mode surface design more complicated, and the low-speed crawling phenomenon in servo system of PMLSM may also affect the positioning accuracy. To handle these issues, a speed-constrained SMPC based on the control barrier function (CBF) is proposed in this manuscript. By introducing CBF, the speed constraint is transformed into a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem of q-axis current, achieving speed constraint while avoiding the use of cascaded sliding mode surfaces. A good speed constraining effect can be achieved by appropriately selecting the parameters of CBF. In addition, a new sliding mode reaching law consisting of the double power reaching law (DPRL) and a super-twisting-like integral term is proposed. Compared with the exponential reaching law (ERL) in PSISMC, DPRL can alleviate the contradiction between sliding mode chattering and convergence speed. The super-twisting-like term is proposed and designed to alleviate the low-speed crawling phenomenon. Finally, experiments have demonstrated the advantages of CBF-SMC in positioning and tracking performance, as well as the effectiveness of its speed constraint capability."

    "abstract": "Color is a powerful tool in data visualization, but for individuals with color vision deficiencies (CVD), hue can become a barrier rather than an aid. In this paper, we examine how real-world visualizations are perceived across vision profiles through three complementary studies. Study 1 assessed how normal vision participants rated 46 visualizations shown in original and simulated red/green colorblind versions. Study 2 collected matched responses from participants with diagnosed CVD. Study 3 involved in-depth interviews exploring how users interpret, adapt to, and evaluate inaccessible designs. Across studies, we find that simulations capture directional perceptual shifts but fail to reflect the interpretive breakdowns and emotional work described by real CVD users. Factor analysis reveals two dominant perceptual dimensions: functional utility and affective experience. While normal vision participants prioritize functional clarity, CVD users rely more on structural cues and emotional resonance, particularly when color is unreliable. Qualitative insights show that perceptual breakdowns occur not only in high-interference charts but also when redundant encoding or layout scaffolding is missing. We synthesize these findings and offer empirically grounded design recommendations to guide inclusive visualization practices. Our results argue that accessibility must go beyond color correction, embracing structural clarity, redundancy, and real-user validation to ensure inclusive visual communication."

    "abstract": "Mathematical applets have become essential tools in the teaching and learning of mathematics, offering interactive and dynamic representations of mathematical concepts. For students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, these applets must be designed to address their specific cognitive and learning needs to be truly effective. Despite increased efforts to support students with ASD in digital learning environments, no validated set of guidelines exist for designing mathematical applets tailored to these students. This study fills this gap by developing and validating a set of guidelines, operationalized for dynamic mathematical environments such as GeoGebra. In particular, the study advances beyond prior work by following a rigorous three-phase validation methodology involving two rounds of expert review with quantitative agreement analysis, and by explicitly grounding each guideline in the cognitive traits characteristic of ASD and their documented impact on mathematical learning. The multi-phase process starts with a literature review that incorporates cognitive traits of ASD, their impact on mathematical learning, and interface design principles. The guidelines are then refined through two rounds of expert validation, first by specialists in ASD and mathematics education, then by experts in GeoGebra applet development. Expert feedback is systematically integrated, ensuring both theoretical soundness and practical feasibility. The final guidelines provide a structured approach for designing mathematical applets tailored to the needs of students with ASD, while also serving as a foundation for further research in this field."

    "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of video surveillance systems, person re-identification (ReID) based on computer vision techniques has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. However, existing ReID methods still face challenges in handling sample pair difficulty variations and feature representation learning. This paper proposes an Adaptive Thresholding Triplet Loss (ATTL) method to address these issues. Compared to traditional triplet loss, ATTL dynamically adjusts the selection range of positive and negative samples through an adaptive threshold mechanism and introduces a global weighting strategy to optimize feature space structure. Specifically, this method first adaptively determines the positive and negative sample selection thresholds for each anchor sample based on the distribution characteristics of sample distances within the batch, thereby focusing the model more on discriminative difficult sample pairs. Second, by introducing class-level weight factors, global structural information is incorporated into the loss function, enhancing the discriminative power of the features. We conducted extensive experimental validation on three mainstream ReID datasets (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03). The experimental results show that even when the baseline model has achieved high performance levels, the proposed ATTL method still brings significant improvements. On the Market-1501 dataset, ATTL improved Rank-1 accuracy and mAP by 0.4% and 0.9% respectively. Visual analysis of feature distributions further confirms the advantages of this method in optimizing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. These findings provide new research directions for improving the performance of person re-identification systems."

    "abstract": "Target detection in remote sensing imagery, particularly for identifying sparsely distributed materials, plays a crucial role in areas such as defense security and surveillance, mineral exploration, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The likelihood of successful detection and the quality of results depends on various factors, including sensor specifications, platform characteristics, target-background interactions, spectral contrast of the targets, and atmospheric conditions. Traditionally, target detection in remote sensing has been approached with statistical algorithms that assume a linear image formation process. Understanding the geometry of image acquisition and the stability of spectral features across different imaging platforms is essential for developing an effective spectral target detection system. In this research work, we conducted a comprehensive target detection experiment to identify various artificial target materials. We utilized a benchmark multi-platform hyperspectral dataset, deploying targets on diverse surface backgrounds. Data was collected with instruments such as spectroradiometers, UAVs, and airborne platforms within a half-hour interval. The experiment was conducted on July 23, 2021, at the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Tait Preserve in Penfield, NY, USA. We validated the detection outcomes through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and spectral similarity metrics across various detection algorithms and imaging platforms. This comprehensive analysis of the multi-platform benchmark dataset provides valuable insights for addressing key challenges in hyperspectral target detection across realistic landscape settings."

    "abstract": "Radiometric calibration is the foundation for the quantitative analysis of imaging spectrometers. The linear gradient filter hyperspectral camera has the characteristic that the spectral central wavelength and half-wave width change linearly with specific positions. However, it suffers from issues such as central wavelength shifts in the spectral channel and inconsistencies in response between multiple sensors. Therefore, each band requires strict and precise laboratory calibration. This paper systematically summarizes the laboratory calibration process for the Luojia 4-01 satellite, including the calculation of spectral response functions, central wavelengths, and half-wave widths for each band, the evaluation of the linear relationship between sensor response and gain, integration level, and exposure time, and the calculation of relative and absolute calibration coefficients. Verification results show that the linear relationship of the three gradient filters is well-fitted. After relative calibration, the nonuniformity of the response decreased from 20% - 3% to 0. 3% - 0. 1%, with uncertainties for the relative and absolute calibration coefficients of 2. 27% and 5. 67%, respectively. Furthermore, the TOA reflectance uncertainty of the proposed method compared to Sentinel-2 reaches 4.6%, demonstrating high calibration accuracy. The proposed laboratory calibration method can be extended to other gradient filter hyperspectral imaging instruments."

To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreqCross, a novel knowledge distillation framework featuring two key innovations: a frequency-guided feature extraction mechanism that prioritizes high-frequency information essential for damage detection, and a cross-decoder transfer architecture that leverages the teacher model’s decoder as a reference to enhance student learning. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world disaster datasets demonstrate that our lightweight approach consistently achieves superior assessment accuracy compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Radar signal sorting plays a critical role in modern electronic reconnaissance. The affinity propagation (AP) algorithm, a reliable unsupervised clustering method, suits this task but encounters the batch expansion problem, where a single emitter is erroneously split into multiple clusters. To address this issue, this paper proposes a radar signal sorting method to reduce batch expansion. First, the traditional AP algorithm is improved by introducing a decay factor, and the improved AP algorithm (IAP) is applied for pre-sorting the pulse data. Subsequently, candidate merging centroids are extracted based on density. Finally, batch merging determination is performed by integrating the statistical features of the arrival directions of pulse clusters. The proposed method comprehensively utilizes the geometric, distributional, and statistical characteristics of radar pulse data, fully exploring the latent correlations and patterns among signals. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces batch expansion while maintaining high sorting accuracy, outperforming comparative methods. This provides an effective solution for multifunctional radar signal sorting."

Using this application a blind Earth science student was able to visualize and describe a variety of both vector and raster datasets in a way that has previously only been available with sighted assistance and enabled them to perform a range of processing tasks on spatial datasets including reprojecting data into various coordinate reference systems, simplifying vector geometries, and generating slope and aspect maps from a digital elevation model.

Based on injecting a common mode voltage across the arm, the required arm inductance is used to generate the basis for energy exchange. Meanwhile, its modular structure is ideally suited for medium and high voltage DC applications and allows for easy submodule(SM) replacement. Its central feature includes: 1) bidirectional flow of power and 2) internal energy complementation. A new degree of freedom is found to control the transmission of power. The operation of the MMDC is analyzed in the ideal case which means no internal energy loss is considered.

Such electrification allows to reduce the platform carbon emission by decommissioning local engines. The choice of a direct ac/ac MMC topology, together with the proposed control capabilities and ancillary services, are technology enablers to reduce both the investment cost and the operating cost of the system.

Combining satellite images and artificial intelligence technologies is efficient to detect large and subtle changes caused by selective logging. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time-series data and a Sentinel-2 optical image to detect selective logging using transformers. We proposed a dissimilar transformer (DisFormer) that values the dissimilarity among time stamps. An experiment with Sentinel-2 data and the dissimilar transformer achieved the highest overall accuracy of 86.83%, giving a better performance than the traditional Transformer. The results indicated that the DisFormer could detect subtle changes caused by selective logging that were not visible in Sentinel-2 optical images, despite both Sentinel-2 and Sentinel1 images having a spatial resolution of 10 meters. The study concludes that the use of DisFormer and NDSVI images enhances the performance of SAR time series images on selective logging detection."

    "abstract": "Fine-grained semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is crucial for applications like land use analysis and agricultural monitoring. However, existing methods struggle with distinguishing objects with small inter-class differences, leading to misclassification. To address this, we propose TCNet, a timestep-controlled cyclic network with three novel components: Knowledge Refining, Representation, and Pixel parts. The Knowledge Refining module iteratively refines segmentation features using information from past and future steps, enhancing the network’s ability to delineate similar objects. The Representation module bridges feature extraction and pixel-level transformation, improving class differentiation. Additionally, a specialized loss function in the Pixel part integrates results from multiple steps and applies comprehensive constraints across stages. We conduct extensive experiments on three different datasets, including the FBP dataset and the Potsdam dataset, where the FBP dataset contains objects of 24 fine-grained categories. The results showed that compared to baseline, TCNet's mIoU and OA increased by 11.6% and 9.2%, respectively, while TCNet also maintains a leading ability to settle conventional semantic segmentation tasks."

    "abstract": "Referring remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for achieving fine-grained visual understanding through free-format textual input, enabling enhanced scene and object extraction in remote sensing applications. Current research primarily utilizes pre-trained language models to encode textual descriptions and align them with visual modalities, thereby facilitating the expression of relevant visual features. However, these approaches often struggle to establish robust alignments between fine-grained semantic concepts, leading to inconsistent representations across textual and visual information. To address these limitations, we introduce a referring remote sensing image segmentation foundational model, RSRefSeg. RSRefSeg leverages CLIP for visual and textual encoding, employing both global and local textual semantics as filters to generate referring-related visual activation features in the latent space. These activated features then serve as input prompts for SAM, which refines the segmentation masks through its robust visual generalization capabilities. Experimental results on the RRSIS-D dataset demonstrate that RSRefSeg outperforms existing methods, underscoring the effectiveness of foundational models in enhancing multimodal task comprehension.

A DJI Matrice 300 RTK UAV equipped with a LiDAR sensor, a high-resolution RGB camera, and a multispectral camera were used to collect data on individual tree detection, tree height, and species composition. The LiDAR data was used to create a canopy height model and detect individual trees, while the multispectral data was used to classify tree species using a random forest classification algorithm. Allometric equations were then used to estimate the carbon stock of each tree based on its height and species. The results showed that the UAV-based method was effective in detecting individual trees (F-score=0.74) and estimating their height (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=0.94). The species classification also performed well, with an overall accuracy of 84%. The distribution of carbon stock values showed differences depending on the tree height and species composition. English oak showed significantly higher carbon stock values compared to white hornbeam and black locust. This methodology can be used to establish a baseline for carbon stock estimation and monitoring over time, which is essential for generating carbon credits and evaluating carbon sequestration rates."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of power electronics, power systems exhibit a “double-high” trend of highpenetration power electronics. Among them, the converters serve as the foundation for integrating multiple energy sources. However, conducting a thorough analysis of its wide-frequency characteristics presents a significant challenge. Accurate widefrequency coupling models are essential for analyzing the ability of power electronic equipment to withstand wide-frequency perturbations and determining the acceptance of new energy sources in the grid. Yet system complexity and device diversity require different modeling approaches, which makes traditional methods impractical due to their complexity. To achieve a balanced compromise between model relatability and accuracy, this paper proposes a backpropagation neural network with the embedded adaptive denoising training mechanism (EADT) method for harmonic disturbance coupling analysis in a singleconverter scenario. The approach eliminates reliance on detailed system parameters, enabling direct harmonic disturbance analysis via trained models to determine current coupling characteristics."

Traditional machine learning methods are limited in efficiently processing high-resolution remote sensing data, while quantum machine learning (QML) has the potential for parallel computing and exponential acceleration. However, the noise and limited qubits of quantum hardware in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era limit the application of QML. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Cut Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (CHQC-Net), which combines the classical ResNet-18 and the Matrix Product State (MPS)-based Quantum Neural Network (QNN). By employing a bit cutting method, large quantum circuits are decomposed into smaller subcircuits, reducing the required number of qubits and simplifying circuit implementation. Experiments on the EuroSAT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, highlighting the potential of quantum computing in remote sensing image classification."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a graph-based robust cloud removal method for satellite images via optical-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image fusion. Cloud contamination in optical satellite images significantly limits their usability for geoscience applications. In contrast, SAR images, acquired through microwave backscatter measurement, are unaffected by clouds because microwaves penetrate them. Consequently, recent studies have explored optical-SAR fusion, which combines SAR and optical images to estimate cloud-free optical data. However, most existing methods heavily rely on learning techniques to model the relationship between these two types of data, which often lack mathematical interpretability. Furthermore, they do not explicitly account for noise in optical images which is inevitable in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we develop a novel framework that simultaneously performs denoising and optical-SAR fusion without using any opaque mechanisms. Specifically, we construct a graph based on both optical and SAR images that captures the spatial structure of the entire image. Then, based on this graph and some assumptions for optical and SAR images, we formulate the fusion problem as an optimization problem and solve it by a primal-dual splitting method. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove clouds despite the presence of noise."

Its best performance was achieved at a maximum depth of 5, reaching $\\mathbf{9 4 \\%}$ accuracy on a dataset of $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ real user responses. Inference results from the model aligned with PHQ-9 severity scores in 94 out of $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ cases, indicating strong agreement. CART also demonstrated high computational efficiency, with the shortest training time and lowest memory usage compared to other models.

    "abstract": "A campaign was carried out offshore China in May and June of 2023, using a suite of calibration equipment including a seabed-based pressure gauge, which provided continuous measurements for more than two months. The sea bottom depth can be retrieved from the temperature, salinity and pressure of both the sea surface and bottom. The sea surface height (SSH) can be retrieved from the sea bottom depth by subtracting the datum, which can be determined by an overhead GNSS buoy. The seabed-based pressure gauge outperforms the traditional surface GNSS buoys in stability and reliability, especially under high sea state condition. The pressure gauge was mounted nearby the Sentinel-6A satellite nadir (~5 km), bringing the opportunity of the SSH calibration. The Level 2 data products (both high resolution and low resolution) of cycles 91-96, pass #153 were processed in the in-situ calibration. Only the 1Hz altimetry measurements 30km or closer to the seabed-based pressure gauge were considered in the calibration procedure. In the computation of the altimeter SSH, four configurations were tested. It can be shown that, the inclusion of radiometer can significantly improve the calibration results. The estimated SSH bias for LRM and SARM were similar. Meanwhile, the standard deviations of the SSH bias series for LRM and SARM were both within 1 cm. These results were somewhat over-optimistic, but the effectiveness of the SSH calibration approach using seabed-based pressure gauges can be demonstrated."

Based on VAMP deep unfolding, we provide a parameter convergence detector (PCD) to estimate the recovery error distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, both the sparse solution and non-sparse noisy estimation are utilized to estimate the distribution parameter and implement CFAR detection in PCD, which leverages both the VAMP distribution property and the improved sparse recovery accuracy provided by deep unfolding.

To address this issue, various mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature, including improved inverter designs, advanced pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies, and the use of filters. Recent studies show that a 4 -wire topology with a CM choke can also effectively mitigate CM current in VFD over a wide frequency range. Nonetheless, limitations of existing neutral filter topology at lower frequencies have prompted further research. This paper presents the design, and analysis of an optimized neutral filter topology for a 4-wire electric drive system, aiming to reduce CM current. The study presents an in-depth analysis of CM current in three-phase 4-wire Permanent Magnet (PM) synchronous motors through the high-frequency model of the motor, theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and practical measurement. The newly designed neutral filter incorporates three key design criteria: neutral current, efficiency, and resonance overshoot considerations. Both the theoretical simulations and practical measurements indicate that the proposed 4-wire topology exhibits significant lower CM current across a wide frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz compared to a well-filtered 3 -wire topology, and 4-wire topologies available in the literature. This demonstrates its potential for practical applications in reducing electromagnetic interference and improving system stability."

Using the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) within the Dense Media Radiative Transfer Theory (DMRT), we simulate scattering properties and microwave signatures of wet snow. The proposed model highlights the impact of water morphology on scattering coefficients, revealing non-monotonic relationships with wetness levels and distinct effects of water films and droplets. These findings surpass the capabilities of empirical models and provide valuable insights into the internal melting processes of wet snow, ultimately enhancing the interpretation of microwave observations and improving snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval accuracy. Validation was performed using field measurements from the NoSREx campaign, where the model demonstrated reliable agreement in simulating backscatter and brightness temperature during both dry and wet snow periods. To address gaps in temporal resolution and to further refine the model, a field campaign at the Altay National Meteorological Station was conducted in the 2024-2025 snow season and multi-frequency measurements were performed during the critical frozen-melting transition, advancing wet snow modeling and validation efforts."

Since noise is usually contained in the high frequency component along with structural information, WSSB can effectively remove noise in high frequency component and enhance features in low frequency components by applying spatial attention to the low frequency component and group spectral attention to the high-frequency component, respectively. Then, the high frequency features after noise removal are combined with the low frequency information to reconstruct the image. Finally, the high frequency features affected by denoising can be restored with the assistance of enhanced low frequency information via a local-global aware block consist of Swin Transformers and residual convolution. Extensive experiments on various datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, existing SAR-based change detection algorithms face challenges in noise removal and detecting subtle changes when applied to ground-based radar images. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved change detection method. The method constructs difference maps using an enhanced relative entropy and mean ratio method, fuses them with Non-Subsampled Contourlet Transform and local energy methods, and refines the result using bilateral filtering. Finally, optimal threshold Non-Local Means (NLM) based on the Fisher criterion is introduced in the MAP-MRF model for difference map segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the method significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of change detection."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) techniques can improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Some of the existing HSI-SR methods are realized by fusing high-resolution multispectral images (Hr-MSI) with low-resolution hyperspectral images (Lr-HSI). Most of these methods use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract image features. CNNs have a strong feature acquisition capability, but their receptive field limits their ability to acquire long-range relationships between different pixels. Therefore we propose a graph-based network (GNet) for HSI-SR. This method first acquires the primary features of different images, and then constructs the connections between nodes from the acquired spectral features of Lr-HSI and transfers them to the feature graph of Hr-MSI. We use GNet to obtain long-distance relationships between pixels and to facilitate information flow in multi-stream networks. The performance and competitive advantages of GNet are evaluated by comparing it with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

So, the proposed method can effectively integrate the target with the background, resulting in high-fidelity images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both authenticity and image quality removing clutter around ships.

    "abstract": "Accurately validating satellite surface reflectance data in rugged forested areas is of crucial importance for applications such as forest resource assessment, ecological monitoring, and climate change research. However, these areas have inherent complexities, characterized by diverse terrains, solar-viewing geometries, and canopy structures. This introduces significant uncertainties and errors when validating satellite reflectance using ground/airborne-based data. This study focuses on validating optical satellite reflectance data by leveraging airborne hyperspectral reflectance data reconstructed through the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. Pu'er City, Yunnan Province, China, was selected as the study area. Instead of directly validating the acquired airborne data against satellite data, the BRDF model was employed to reconstruct airborne reflectance data corresponding to the satellite imaging time. The results show that when validating near-infrared (NIR) reflectance data, direct validation using traditional airborne remote sensing data yielded a coefficient of determination (R) of 0.80, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.084, and a bias of-0.07. In contrast, the airborne reflectance data reconstructed by the BRDF according to the satellite imaging time improved these metrics. The R value reached 0.81, the RMSE was 0.035, and the bias was 0.0097. These results indicate that the BRDF-based method is more effective in validating satellite reflectance images in complex forest terrains. The findings provide valuable insights into the accuracy and reliability of satellite optical data, enhancing its applicability and understanding in challenging forest environments."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an improved modulation method of the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC/DC converter. The method is categorized as an optimized Triple Phase Shift (TPS) modulation. The TPS minimizes overall power loss of the DAB based on basic equations, which are newly derived to express loss of semiconductors and a high-frequency transformer as functions of switching phase angles. The derived equations are characterized by use of a floor function, and transformer currents and input/output direct currents can be represented universally regardless of switching angles conditions. Furthermore, as a result of this optimization, it was found that the DAB can be controlled very efficiently by dividing the operating region of output voltage and current into four modes, including both Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and Zero Current Switching (ZCS). The proposed method was applied to a 25 kW DAB converter, and its effectiveness was verified through both analysis and experimentation. The developed approach exhibited high efficiency, maintaining more than 98% across a wide operating range-output voltages from 300 V to 800 V and currents from 30 A to 60 A-and the peak efficiency was industry-leading value of 98.8%."

The dynamics of two different current offset mitigation strategies are compared with the basic single-step single-side modulation. The obtained control-to- output voltage and input current transfer functions are validated in simulations, which demonstrate the model effectively accounts for the high frequency dynamics of the different modulation strategies. Finally, by integrating an averaging filter of the measured variables into the model, the additional delay caused by the two-step phase-shift transition is observed in the results, which causes a higher phase decay at high frequencies than in the case of the single-step modulation."

OptiSarFormer integrates diverse modalities using a Siamese network architecture with hierarchical transformer encoders for efficient feature extraction. It features two shared encoder branches for SAR imagery and a third branch for independent optical image processing, aggregating all features, including SAR-based differentials, into a CNN-based decoder to produce a final change map.

To address the issue, a approach of target discrimination and strong clutter suppression is proposed in this paper. This method involves compensating for clutter Doppler, target discrimination and clutter suppression. Firstly, for the non-stationary clutter, the algorithm of derivative based updating (DBU) is adopted to solve the non-stationary problem. Subsequently, a space-time peak to side-lobe ratio (ST-PSLR) spectrum is proposed to discriminate the target from the strong clutter. Finally, the clutter is suppressed through STAP algorithm utilizing the discrimination result of the target. The numerical simulation result verify the effectiveness of this methodology."

To achieve InSAR monitoring of large-scale land subsidence, this paper utilizes PS-InSAR technology, which involves segmented processing followed by splicing. Based on the hydrogeological parameters and groundwater extraction data of the North China Plain, a numerical simulation model was established in this paper, and combined with the InSAR land subsidence monitoring results, it was verified that groundwater extraction has a profound impact on the development of land subsidence. The main research results are as follows: (1) Using Sentinel-1 image data from January 2018 to June 2019 and time series analysis based on SNAP and StaMPS software, the center rate of land subsidence in Cangzhou City is -125.6mm/y. (2) A quasi-three-dimensional groundwater numerical simulation model for the North China Plain was constructed by using groundwater simulation system software. According to groundwater mining data and the SUB sedimentation module, a ground subsidence model induced by groundwater mining in Cangzhou City was established. The simulation results show that if only the induced factors of groundwater exploitation are considered, the land subsidence center rate in Cangzhou City in 2019 can reach -130mm/y. The two experiments have proved that groundwater exploitation is the dominant factor in the inducement of land subsidence in Cangzhou City."

The December 2022 launch of The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) will bring new advances in gravity field and seafloor topography inversion. The use of neural networks for gravity inversion of seafloor topography instead of traditional methods such as SAS is a current research hot spot. In this study, the FCNN network is used to recover the bathymetry of the western Pacific Ocean north of the equator (147.5°E 155°E, 10°N 20°N), using the V32.1 gravity modeling released by the SIO team, which is based on the 30-year surface height data from the traditional nadir altimetry, and the VSWOT.02 gravity modeling released by the SWOT satellite, which is based on the 1-year surface height data, to compare the effect of the two data in the seafloor topography inversion. The study shows that the VSWOT.02 gravity data have improved the accuracy and resolution of the seafloor topography compared with the traditional gravity data, and the RMSE has been reduced from 205 m to 182 m, and more details of the seafloor can be observed."

However, the detailed controls of inverters are normally hidden by manufacturers which brings difficulties of analyzing the dynamics of the inverter itself as well as the whole power grids. Therefore, in this paper, a grey-box reverse derivation method is proposed, which enables us to reversely derive the internal control parameters of a grid-forming inverter based on its output impedance spectrum. Frequency-domain Bode diagrams and time-domain simulation waveforms are presented in different situations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this paper, we propose a multi-domain interaction detector (MDID) to detect various objects in extreme environments through the multi-domain effective integration of RGB-infrared images. The main feature interaction blocks consist of the dual wavelet enhancement block (DWEB) and the dual inception fusion block (DIFB). Specifically, DWEB can acquire valuable shared features between RGB-infrared image pairs in the frequency domain to mitigate modality feature conflicts during the feature extraction process. Then, DIFB can represent the object fusion information of varying scales and enhance the channel attention of the fused feature maps, which achieves the fusion of RGB-infrared image pairs in the spatial and channel domains. The experimental results with a challenging dataset confirm that our MDID performs better than the SOTA methods."

This study employed synthetically generated SAR images to evaluate the effectiveness of cross-correlation techniques, both incoherent and coherent, in mitigating these ambiguities. The approach was further validated using a real SAR image from the TanDEM-X mission, where controlled ambiguities were artificially introduced to test the robustness of the proposed methodology.

The number of parameters is 35% less than standard UNet. Three different datasets — the Massachusetts Roads Dataset, the DeepGlobe Road Extraction Dataset, and the CHN6-CUG Roads Dataset — were used to validate DepthLiteNet. When compared to state of the art techniques, our results demonstrates notable and consistent increase in Intersection Over Union (IOU) by values 0.98%, 5.62%, and 2.7% for the Massachusetts Roads Dataset, the DeepGlobe Road Extraction Dataset, and the CHN6-CUG Roads Dataset respectively."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing object detection (RSOD) algorithms can accurately capture the distribution of objects on the Earth’s surface with powerful spatial resolution. Deep learning-based RSOD algorithms have achieved excellent performance, which is mainly attributed to strong backbone networks with powerful feature extraction abilities. However, existing backbone networks typically use fixed receptive fields to extract image features, neglecting the requirement for varying receptive fields in RSOD. Additionally, the large number of parameters and high computational costs of these models limit their real-time performance. In this paper, a Decomposable Multi-kernel Convolutional Network containing a Multi-kernel Receptive Field Module (MRF) and a Feature Selection Module is proposed for RSOD. Specifically, the MRF module employs sparse convolutional computations to achieve feature extraction across multiple receptive fields, exploring the local spatial features of targets at multiple scales while reducing model complexity. Meanwhile, the FSM module leverages attention modeling in both spatial and channel dimensions for feature selection, enhancing effective object features across different receptive fields. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the publicly available DIOR and DOTA datasets, and the experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods."

While MMF has demonstrated improved predictive performance in remote sensing applications, its susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical issue. This study investigates the impact of spatial data content on adversarial attacks in MMF, focusing on how perturbations in remote sensing modalities affect system robustness. Using gradient-based attacks (FGSM, BIM, PGD), we evaluate the vulnerability of MMF models under varying spatial patch sizes. Our findings reveal that MMF models are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, even when only a single modality, such as HSI, is targeted. Although fusion improves accuracy on clean samples, it does not inherently enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. Experiments on the Houston13 and MUUFL datasets demonstrate relatively high accuracy on clean samples, while adversarial accuracy remains significantly lower, highlighting a critical trade-off. These results emphasize the need for specialized defense strategies tailored to the unique characteristics of remote sensing data to ensure the security and reliability of MMF models in critical applications such as environmental monitoring and military surveillance."

To mitigate this issue, a novel cost aggregation network is proposed, termed cost aggregation with pyramidal transformer (CAPT), which can effectively address the challenges ISAR image segmentation faces. Features are first extracted from the input image, then four-dimensional convolution is adopted to capture spatial relationships in the image for cost aggregation. Finally, the output image corresponding to the predicted projection mask is decoded by the affinity-guided transformer decoder (ATD). Multiple sets of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of CAPT for ISAR few-shot image segmentation."

Current deep learning-based methods rely on autoencoders under the linear mixing model assumption, where endmembers are represented by decoder parameters. These approaches limit their applicability in nonlinear and complex scenarios, and also make them challenging to impose constraints on endmembers, potentially resulting in poor endmember estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear blind HU method called GMMFU through decoder-based generalized mixing mechanism fitting grounded in the initial nonlinear mixing model assumption. GMMFU simultaneously estimates abundances and endmembers while fitting the mixing mechanism, expressed as a generalized form that surpasses current autoencoder-based methods. Additionally, GMMFU separates the endmembers from the decoder and constrains them to the hyperspectral image data distribution using the proposed endmember consistency and discrepancy losses. This improves the accuracy of endmember estimation, which in turn enhances successively the abundance estimation. Experimental results show that GMMFU outperforms other algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively."

    "abstract": "The car electrification is taking place for reasons of responsible resource and energy use. The components of electromobility, including the traction inverter, are enablers but also consume resources and energy themselves. The sustainability of these components is usually assessed with the help of a life cycle analysis (LCA). This paper focuses on the carbon footprint assessment of a 250 kW SiC traction inverter in B6 configuration during both manufacturing and use phases. Because the use of a car varies, different operating scenarios, including fixed hours, mileage-based, and mission profile-based cycles, were evaluated for the use phase. The results show that, in addition to the mission profile, e.g., the switching frequency and the choice of semiconductors, also influence the carbon footprint. A GaN-based ANPC inverter offers improved durability and lower annual emissions. Integrating use phase insights into early design, such as topology and semiconductor selection, enhances the carbon footprint."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a key element in addressing complex issues in many fields, thanks to its ability to analyze large amounts of data and provide innovative solutions. This study focuses on the application of AI to estimate turbidity values in the coastal waters of the Veneto region in Italy using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The primary goal is to assess the impact of atmospheric correction on the reliability of derived parameters, an essential factor in monitoring water quality and safeguarding marine ecosystems. The project integrates in situ data provided by ARPAV, the regional Agency of Environment Protection, with satellite imagery accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE), generating separate datasets based on L1C and L2A images, respectively. These datasets were employed to train and evaluate multiple Machine Learning (ML) models to identify the most effective approach for turbidity estimation and environmental monitoring optimization. The analysis highlighted that the use of atmospherically corrected data is not strictly necessary and underlined the need for strategies to improve model performance, especially in conditions of limited data availability. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using AI algorithms for water quality monitoring, providing a concrete basis for future developments. This approach has the potential to support timely and targeted interventions for the protection of the marine environment and public health."

To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal image registration method based on style transfer. On one hand, an unsupervised style transfer model is introduced to achieve modality fitting, transforming SAR images into optical images and effectively reducing modality differences. On the other hand, to enhance registration performance, we design a phase congruency-based feature matching algorithm. This algorithm offers advantages such as a higher number of features and improved robustness, which significantly enhance registration accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream handcrafted methods, enabling the registration of SAR-optical cross-modal image pairs effectively."

The emerging paradigm of onboard computing seeks to address several detection problems of interest directly onboard of a satellite, in order to minimize latency due to the downlink and processing chain. In this paper, we design a novel lightweight architecture for onboard spatial super-resolution of hyperspectral images with the goal of improving onboard detection methods that rely on such images. The core of our contribution is a novel neural network architecture that works in a line-by-line fashion thanks to a recurrent-attentive mechanism in the along-track direction. This design greatly limits the memory requirements and computational complexity of the model, making it suitable for onboard usage. We show that this novel architecture is competitive with respect to the state of the art in term of super-resolution quality, while providing significant savings in complexity and memory."

    "abstract": "Solar power generation has great potential as the most widely used renewable energy due to its environmental friendliness and zero emission of greenhouse gases or other pollution. However, the limitations of energy storage from batteries are one of the obstacles in this system. Optimizing the use of solar energy in batteries is expected to reduce household energy costs and reduce dependence on conventional energy sources. This study aims to optimize battery energy storage in solar power systems through the design of a microcontroller-based Autocharger Controller (ACC) Version 1 and the addition of a battery-supercapacitor combination. The research methods include the design of a microcontroller-based ACC version 1 and a battery-supercapacitor, testing the performance of PWM-type SCC and ACC version 1, as well as a cost-benefit analysis. Data collection was conducted using voltage, current, and temperature sensors. Data analysis was performed using efficiency comparisons calculated based on input and output power in solar power systems, state of charge (SoC), and depth of discharge (DoD) in energy storage, as well as feasibility analysis of the ratio-present value (NPV), Payback period, and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). The test results indicate that the ACC can enhance charging efficiency, as demonstrated by the test data collected at noon WIB, which showed a $\\mathbf{2 . 1 9 \\%}$ increase in efficiency. Based on the SoC level, the ACC has a lower level compared to the SCC; however, the depth of discharge (DoD) of the energy storage is lower for the ACC, at $45.60 \\%$, compared to the SCC’s energy storage discharge depth of $\\mathbf{5 2 . 4 0 \\%}$. The cost-benefit analysis of solar power systems using the ACC is more profitable than those using SCC, with a profit of approximately $\\mathbf{4 4 . 9 9 \\%}$. Optimizing the energy storage system through a microcontroller-based active power control (ACC) and the addition of a supercapacitor can enhance the solar power system, making it a worthy consideration."

It facilitates the identification and correction of accumulated drift errors, thereby significantly enhancing map accuracy and consistency. Compared to traditional perspective images, panoramic images provide richer environmental information. This effectively mitigates perceptual ambiguities in place recognition and reduces feature mismatches caused by the viewpoint limitations of perspective images. Furthermore, the omnidirectional view provided by panoramic images partially addresses the common reverse loop-closure problem, which refers to place recognition mismatches caused by viewpoint reversal when a robot retraces its original path. We propose a loop closure detection method based on a 3D panoramic semantic topological map, leveraging the advantages of semantic, depth, spatial information, and panoramic images. Benchmark experiments on the Pitts250K-P2E and YQ360 datasets demonstrate the method is efficiency and precision. Furthermore, it has the potential to enhance the PanoVPR model, thereby improving localization accuracy."

    "abstract": "Conventional canopy height mapping single-angle remote sensing approaches often suffer from limited information utilization and saturation effects, making it challenging to accurately capture the complex three-dimensional structure of forests. To address these issues, we propose a hotspot-driven multi-angle index that leverages the near-infrared-to-red band ratio of hotspot reflectances from a surface roughness perspective, thereby enhancing the representation of canopy height variations. Results have revealed the intended correlation between forest canopy height and surface roughness through the hotspot multi-angle index. Furthermore, the hotspot multi-angle index does not exhibit saturation as forest cover increases in real-world applications. There is a logarithmic relationship between this index and forest canopy height (R = 0.71, RMSE = 7.99 m), demonstrating its strong explanatory power and effectiveness in characterizing vertical forest structure. However, its effectiveness in representing canopy height is influenced by factors such as solar zenith angle (SZA) and terrain to some extent. Our results indicate that the explanatory ability of the index declines significantly at large SZA, such as 65° (R = 0.71 vs. 0.51); and large topographic variations can affect the performance of the multi-angle index in predicting forest canopy height, with 15° serving as a typical threshold. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of the hotspot-driven multi-angle index as a promising tool for large-scale forest canopy height mapping using multi-angle remote sensing observations."

The model innovatively combines UNeXt with the RWKV-SAM encoder, aiming to achieve an optimized balance between model lightweighting and segmentation performance. By introducing the RWKV-SAM encoder, the global perception ability and computational efficiency of the UNeXt model are enhanced for processing high-resolution remote sensing images. Experimental results on remote sensing image datasets such as Vaihingen and LoveDA demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves segmentation accuracy without a substantial increase in model parameters or computational complexity, especially excelling in boundary accuracy and detail restoration. Compared with the original UNext baseline, the improved model achieves a 10.35% increase in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the Vaihingen dataset and a 7.26% improvement in Overall Accuracy (OA) on the LoveDA dataset."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) achieves impressive results in novel view synthesis for small, single-object scenes through Gaussian ellipsoid initialization and adaptive density control. However, when applied to large-scale remote sensing scenes, 3D GS faces challenges: the point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) are often sparse, and the inherent smoothing behavior of 3D GS leads to over-reconstruction in high-frequency regions, where have detailed textures and color variations. This results in the generation of large, opaque Gaussian ellipsoids that cause gradient artifacts. Moreover, the simultaneous optimization of both geometry and texture may lead to densification of Gaussian ellipsoids at incorrect geometric locations, resulting in artifacts in other views. To address these issues, we propose PSRGS, a progressive optimization scheme based on spectral residual maps. Specifically, we create a spectral residual significance map to separate low-frequency and high-frequency regions. In the low-frequency region, we apply depth-aware and depth-smooth losses to initialize the scene geometry with low threshold. For the high-frequency region, we use gradient features with higher threshold to split and clone ellipsoids, refining the scene. The sampling rate is determined by feature responses and gradient loss. Finally, we introduce a pre-trained network that jointly computes perceptual loss from multiple views, ensuring accurate restoration of high-frequency details in both Gaussian ellipsoids geometry and color. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to assess the effectiveness of our method, which demonstrates competitive rendering quality, especially in recovering texture details in high-frequency regions."

    "abstract": "Cloud-induced gaps in optical satellite imagery hinder the continuous monitoring of vegetation dynamics using indices like NDVI. This study introduces a novel geometric-weighted method to reconstruct NDVI values during cloudy periods by leveraging cloud-free RVI data derived from Sentinel-1 radar imagery. The proposed method employs angular relationships between RVI vectors on neighboring clear-sky dates and the normal vector at the cloudy point to compute weighted contributions for NDVI reconstruction. The approach was applied to wheat fields in Iran (48 sites, 2021) and Australia (32 sites, 2022–2023). The method achieved the highest accuracy (RMSE = 0.020) when using two dates before and after the cloudy date. It performed best during early to mid-growth stages, with minimal error (RMSE = 0.014–0.021) in the first 60 days of the season. The proposed method showed a significant reduction in error (25% to 50%), offering a reliable solution for long-term vegetation monitoring under persistent cloud cover."

This paper introduces an optimization-based distributed backdoor attack, which requires only a minimal number of malicious participants’ backdoors to be embedded into the model. The experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods with respect to attack effectiveness and persistence, and successfully evades two anomaly detection methods specifically designed for discovering backdoor attacks."

They could become infeasible when the number of objectives is large. Some recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency of using a few solutions to synergistically optimize many objectives. This paper further refines and extends this idea for MaO. Specifically, we formulate this idea as a conditional set-optimization problem, termed the few-for-many (F4M) problem. Its optimization objective, referred to as the synergistic optimization index (SOI), is compatible with any user-specified scalarization method, enabling this formulation to flexibly model diverse MaO scenarios. Then, we introduce two specific forms of SOI: linear SOI and Tchebycheff SOI, followed by a theoretical analysis of their optimization complexity, monotonicity, and supermodularity. To apply the F4M formulation to MaO, we develop a greedy estimation-of-distribution algorithm (GEDA) and further design a generic multi-objective test suite (GMOTS). Extensive experimental studies illustrate the ability of GEDA in solving both continuous and discrete MaO problems."

While existing studies have explored various collaboration strategies and resource methods, there remains a notable lack of in-depth research on how to economically allocate a limited budget to acquire both human and agent computing capacities. To address this gap, we first construct a developer model based on theories from psychology and economics, providing a quantitative description of human working time and efficiency. Building upon this, we further investigate the impact of dynamic budget allocation strategies on consumer decision-making. Specifically, a novel budget recycling mechanism is introduced to redistribute unused resources, thereby enhancing system responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate a 56% improvement in resource utilization and a 32% increase in task completion.

Therefore, we propose an accurate and efficient 6-DoF localization method using a uniaxial rotating permanent magnet. In the proposed method, a stepper motor and a permanent magnet are applied to produce the magnetic field containing the extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic waves. Subsequently, the magnetic field and the pole orientation of permanent magnet are detected by a magnetic sensor and an encoder to collect the meta data of localization information. After that, the tracking algorithm is proposed to convert the meta data to the 3D position and orientation. The innovations of this method mainly contain three components: First, as the ELF magnetic waves are employed, the generated magnetic field with a wide range is able to be measured by the sensors under simplified hardware settings. Second, we apply the magnetic dipole model, combined with the geometric constraints derived from our uniaxial rotating structure design, to construct the analytic localization module of tracking algorithm to calculate the real-time 6-DoF localization. Third, the cross loss function is introduced into the localization refinement module of tracking algorithm to improve the method’s accuracy and reliability. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrates its high localization accuracy over a large operation range, and robustness to magnetic interferences. Therefore, our approach outperforms the conventional methods and has a good potential for various tracking applications."

    "abstract": "Ultrafast ultrasound imaging is essential for blood flow imaging. However, achieving an optimal balance between high frame rates and high image quality remains a challenge. Some advanced beamforming techniques can produce high-quality images, but often at the cost of reduced frame rates. In this work, we propose an FPGA-based beamforming method combining the sign multiplication coherence factor and simplified sign coherence factor (SMCF-sSCF), which achieves both high image quality and high frame rates. Meanwhile, the proposed beamformer is implemented on a 128-channel open ultrasound platform, supporting a maximum sub-aperture size of 64, and achieves dynamic focusing through a weighted vector. Simulation results show that, compared to conventional delay-and-sum (DAS), the SMCF-sSCF beamformer improves the contrast ratio (CR), the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) by 41.95%, 16.93%, and 4.89%, respectively, while reducing the full width at half maximum (FWHM) by 36.03%. In an open ultrasound platform, the SMCF-sSCF beamformer achieves a frame rate of 10,557 frames per second (fps) for 128×2048 images, corresponding to an output rate of 2.7 Gpixels/s. Furthermore, compared to a parallel DAS implementation, the resource consumption of LUTs, FFs, and DSPs increases by only 35.24%, 46.51%, and 33.33%, respectively."

Client behavior is evaluated through a dynamic reputation scoring module, with malicious clients being added to a revocation list. By incorporating revocable attribute-based encryption, RDFL supports dynamic user management, ensuring that only authorized participants can access or update the global model. In addition, RDFL employs Shamir’s secret sharing and a pseudorandom double-masking scheme to maintain aggregation accuracy and protect communication privacy despite client dropouts. Experimental evaluations on the Extended MNIST (EMNIST) and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that RDFL achieves strong security, communication efficiency, and model accuracy, making it suitable for FL involving a large number of clients with dynamic participation."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained broad applications across various domains but still struggle with hallucinations. Currently, hallucinations occur frequently in the generation of factual content and pose a great challenge to trustworthy LLMs. However, hallucination detection is hindered by the laborious and expensive manual annotation of hallucinatory content. Meanwhile, as different LLMs exhibit distinct types and rates of hallucination, the collection of hallucination datasets is inherently model-specific, which also increases the cost.

Further analysis on our dataset provides insight into factors that may contribute to LLM hallucinations.

    "abstract": "Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. Evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization."

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides excellent sensitivity but fluorescence readouts often face ambiguity of detection at low template concentrations. Reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) integrated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) enables easy, cost effective, label-free detection and supports portable assays, however, non-specific impedance responses often reduce assay specificity. To overcome these limitations, we apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a post-processing strategy for heterogeneous biosensing signals. NMF decomposes data into physically interpretable latent components by enforcing non-negativity, making it well suited for effective amplification and detection analysis. Two datasets are analyzed: cycle-dependent fluorescence intensity from RT-PCR and frequency-dependent impedance magnitude from RT-LAMP EIS. NMF successfully discriminates amplification-specific contributions from residual noise, improving sensitivity in fluorescence data and specificity in electrochemical measurements. The resulting component scores enable robust classification of positive and negative samples achieving an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 86.7%, outperforming conventional both optical and electrochemical schemes. Using hepatitis C virus RNA as a representative case, we demonstrate that non-negative decomposition framework offers a generalizable strategy for improving the accuracy of molecular diagnostics across diverse biosensing platforms."

    "abstract": "This work introduces a dual-polarized (DP) slot-excited dielectric-filled cavity antenna phased array designed for 5G and beyond AiP solutions using low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology. The primary challenge is to maximize a two-dimensional (2-D) beamsteering range with a compact form factor in a DP operation. Most reported LTCC AiP arrays have ≤ 55° beamsteering range at 5G mmWave frequencies and lack experimental validation for DP 2-D beamsteering operation. In contrast, the proposed antenna element in the infinite array enables ±60° 2-D beamsteering in the 5G n261 (27.5-28.35 GHz) band with the form factor as small as 5mm×5mm×1.3mm. This performance is achieved by introducing a wide-angle impedance matching (WAIM) structure directly at the antenna aperture, comprising a dual-layer metasurface formed by periodically arranged electrically small patches in a staggered configuration. The antenna is jointly optimized with a DP feeding network to minimize parasitics in the multilayer LTCC stack and a co-integrated printed circuit board (PCB) carrier to mitigate package-carrier coupling often neglected in previous works. It is fabricated in a single LTCC process without air gaps to ensure precise layer-to-layer alignment and eliminate losses from additional support structures inherent to conventional air-gap WAIM stacks. A custom equivalent-circuit model enables efficient analysis of scan-dependent impedance matching for the optimization. A 128-element AiP prototype employs 4×4 subarrays of four DP elements on the PCB carrier and is packaged with ball grid arrays (BGAs) to facilitate integration. This modular approach allows scaling to large arrays while considering the critical effects of the package stack-up and DP feeding. The simulated active reflection coefficient is < -8.5 dB within ±60° (with a scan loss marginally above 3 dB) at 27.5-29.5 GHz. Measurements confirm simulations for all relevant performance metrics in ±60° 2D-range."

    "abstract": "Although text-guided infrared-visible image fusion helps improve content understanding under extreme illumination, existing methods usually ignore semantic differences between textual and visual features, resulting in limited improvement. To address this challenge, we propose a Text-Guided Semantic Alignment Network, termed TSANet, for extreme-illumination infrared-visible image fusion. The network follows an encoder-decoder structure, with two image encoders, two text encoders, and one decoder. It uses a Semantic Alignment and Fusion (SAF) block to bridge the two image encoders in each layer. Specifically, the SAF block consists of two parallel Semantic Alignment (SA) modules, corresponding to the infrared and visible modalities, respectively, and a Spatial-Frequency Interaction (SFI) module. The SA module aligns the visual feature from the image encoder with its corresponding textual feature from the text encoder, to guide the network focus on key semantic regions of infrared and visible images. The SFI module aggregates the spatial and frequency information extracted from the modality-aligned features of two SA modules for complementary representation learning. The network progressively complements two image modalities by connecting the SAF blocks from top to down, and finally provides a visually pleasing fusion effect by feeding the output of the last block into the decoder. Recognizing that existing datasets lack illumination diversity, we contribute a new dataset specifically designed for extreme-illumination image fusion. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of TSANet over seven state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WentaoLi-CV/TSANet."

    "abstract": "The cross-regional interconnections of the power system complicates the network topology behind it, which undoubtedly brings great computational challenges to the related simulation analysis. To address this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for power grid topology renormalization based on the Louvain community detection algorithm. This framework aims to coarse-graining the original power grid into a smaller-scale network, thereby significantly simplifying its topology while preserving key properties. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted extensive simulation experiments on a class of synthetic power grids and six real-world power grid datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can nearly perfectly retain the critical structural characteristics and power flow properties of the original power grid during the renormalization process. From a practical application perspective, our findings provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the structural evolution and dynamical behavior of large-scale power grids."

Existing telemetry and monitoring tools provide the plumbing to collect rich measurements and show potential for synchronizing the twin with its physical component.

In this paper, we present the idea of a Neural Measurement Field (NMF), a learning-based adapter that unifies where the measurements are taken (space/location), when they are updated (time), and what information is synchronized (content) into a single continuous intensity function, trained online to maximize decision utility under the budget."

We identify various factors that cause throughput variations at varying timescales. Given our analysis, we design StarNet, a new learning-based throughput prediction system. StarNet incorporates satellite network-specific insights and accurately predicts future throughput for end users.

While unikernels offer superior performance and minimal resource overheads, their traditional update mechanisms require costly rebuilds and restarts, leading to service disruption and state loss. MorphOS addresses this by integrating eBPF to enable dynamic, verified code execution for seamless updates to packet processing logic. It employs an out-of-band verification service to offload computationally intensive verification tasks and utilizes hardware-assisted memory isolation (Memory Protection Keys) for enhanced execution hardening. Our evaluation of MorphOS with four VNF implementations demonstrates significant benefits: MorphOS drastically reduces reconfiguration time, effectively amortizes verification costs, and achieves up to 3× better performance compared to Linux-based VNF deployments, all while preserving the inherent lightweightness of unikernels. MorphOS thus paves the way for adaptable, efficient, and state-preserving networked applications in cloud environments."

These tools support data-driven management strategies aimed at enhancing productivity and sustainability in cotton farming systems. The experiment was conducted at the University of Queensland’s Gatton campus during the 2023–2024 growing season. Direct observations included the canopy height and the dry matter from the biomass cuts, just prior to crop defoliation, to capture peak biomass conditions. Eight multispectral images from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were captured throughout the season. To address temporal gaps between UAV flights, we applied a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to fit growth curves for each plot and each VI. Derivative-Based functions were used on the fitted curves to generate the curve-derived metrics (CDMs). CDMs from both single and multiple dates of the OSAVI index were used as predictors into machine learning (ML) models for the final plant height (m), dry matter (Mg/ha), and yield (kg/ha), achieving strong predictive performance (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.85, 0.87, 0.84; RMSE = 0.05 m, 0.73 Mg/ha, and 118 kg/ha, respectively).

The trained model can produce maps highlighting the areas with a change on forest types, using a pre-event and post-event image pair, either S1-S1, S2-S2, S1-S2, or S2-S1. The performance was validated and demonstrated in southern Sweden between 2018 and 2023. FCCDNet achieved land cover classification accuracy of 93.26% and change detection accuracy of 90.56% when using S2-S2 pair, significantly outperforming four other algorithms tested. When using S1-S2, S2-S1, or S1-S1 pairs, changes can also be detected but with lower accuracy (65.94% - 76.68%). The results show that FCCDNet can achieve forest change detection with higher accuracy than commonly used methods, and can tolerate certain levels of replacement from multispectral images to SAR images in cloudy conditions. The FCCDNet model also showed robustness against salt-and-paper effects of mapping and exhibited sensitivity to changes with smaller amplitude. The FCCDNet model and data processing framework could support the dynamic monitoring of forest resources with high automation and fast response."

This challenge becomes even more complex when the source and target data differ in modality representation, such as when acquired using sensors with varying characteristics. In remote sensing, for example, data may differ in acquisition modes (e.g., optical vs. radar), spectral properties (e.g., RGB vs. multispectral), or spatial resolution. This scenario, known as Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (SSHDA), introduces additional challenges due to the heightened distribution shift caused by modality heterogeneity. This work builds upon SHeDD (Semi-supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation via Disentanglement), a recently proposed method for SSHDA, adapting it to address a more challenging scenario where the target domain has extremely limited labeled data. By introducing a novel adversarial module to compel the domain-invariance of features and incorporating a mean teacher approach to improve pseudo-labeling, the enhanced framework demonstrates robust and stable performances. Empirical evaluations on a well-known remote sensing benchmark for scene classification involving heterogeneous data (radar-multispectral) show that the proposed method outperforms both its predecessor and state-of-the-art competitors.

The research process involves identifying the user roles and system requirements through a Use Case Diagram, followed by Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in order to clearly define access privileges. These data access control rules and roles are then conveyed into specific processes in Data Flow Diagrams, illustrating the flow of data between layers and user activity control. The system was evaluated using access accuracy metrics and simulated misuse scenarios through negative testing. Results show that integrating access control with structured data flow enhances data integrity and user accountability.

    "abstract": "LiDAR relocalization has become a crucial component across multiple disciplines, such as robotics and automation, navigation and localization, and sensor networks, driven by significant advancements in computational capacity and a marked reduction in the costs of LiDAR scanners. In indoor environments, the low availability of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) poses a challenge for LiDAR relocalization. Current LiDAR relocalization methods rely on a large dataset of real LiDAR scans or synthetic LiDAR scans to train a pose regression network. However, Acquiring a large set of real LiDAR scans with exact ground truth poses is costly. Moreover, synthetic LiDAR scans differ from real LiDAR scans, which introduce large relocalization errors. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel LiDAR relocalization method implementing a 3D model and deep pose regression networks based on difference detection. The proposed method applies a coarse-to-better strategy. In the coarse relocalization phase, the initial pose of the LiDAR scanner will be estimated using an off-the-shelf pose estimation method. Then, the estimated pose will be used to generate a synthetic LiDAR scan using a low-detail 3D model, which only contains main structural surfaces. A difference detection network will be applied to detect differences between the synthetic LiDAR scan and the real LiDAR scan, and therefore, the pose regression network will mask the points representing differences and only focus on the same parts. Experiential results show that our proposed method outweighs previous pose regression networks trained with original synthetic LiDAR scans."

    "abstract": "For the demand of solving large-scale phase unwrapping (PU) in synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology, one of the relatively mature methods is to first divide the interferogram into sub-interferograms, and then solve each sub-interferogram separately and splice them together to obtain the PU result. To improve the processing speed, one of the strategies is to generate convex hull regions that can enclose dense residues and then abandon solving these regions to reduce the computational load. However, this method also decreases the utilization of effective information in the discarded regions. In this paper, we propose an elaborate and fast large-scale phase unwrapping method (EFLS). Based on the quality map, EFLS divides the sub-interferograms into high-quality and low-quality regions. By modifying the constraint conditions of the optimization model, it prevents the errors in the low-quality regions from spreading to the high-quality regions, thus solving the problem of solution accuracy in traditional mask-based methods. It masks the low-quality regions and only solves the high-quality regions, improving both the processing efficiency and information utilization while ensuring the solution accuracy."

    "abstract": "As a wideband radar system, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is susceptible affected by other high-power radiation sources, which can cause radio frequency interference (RFI) artifacts in ground observations. Given that RFI significantly impacts data processing and image interpretation, screening and artifacts detection of RFI have become top priorities for spaceborne SAR systems which generate massive data daily. In this paper, a novel screening and artifacts detection method based on change detection techniques is proposed. Due to the time-varying feature of RFI artifacts in time-series SAR images, local areas affected by RFI can be masked by the change detection operator. The screening step is performed by quantifying the feature differences between RFI artifacts and ground-truth information, and an RFI-free background is constructed based on the results, enabling effective artifacts detection of RFI-containing images. Experimental results of Sentinel-1A products indicates that the method can accurately screen RFI-containing images from massive time-series images and effectively detect the location of RFI artifacts."

Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images provide complementary information by reflecting the characteristics of different land cover types from varying perspectives. However, these images belong to different modalities, leading to discrepancies and irrelevancy in representing ground objects, complicating multimodal semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal interaction Transformer (CIT) network that facilitates information exchange and adaptive fusion of optical and SAR images, which addresses the feature alignment discrepancies in different scenes. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on the publicly available Pohang dataset. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CIT achieves a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 93.27% and an overall accuracy (OA) of 97.06% on the Pohang dataset."

Despite numerous efforts to develop methods to reconstruct time series surface reflectance, attention is rarely focused on mountainous areas. In this study, we aim to generate seamless surface reflectance in mountainous areas with consideration of topography. An integrated framework with topographic correction and time series modeling based on the harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 dataset (HLS) has been developed. First, we removed the spatiotemporal varying terrain effects in HLS reflectance using topographic correction methods. Then, we modeled the corrected reflectance time series using harmonic analysis to fill gaps and remove outliers. Finally, we generated seamless reflectance using the constructed time series model. We evaluated the generated seamless reflectance and compared the performance of different TOC methods. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework with the PSC method is superior in the generation of surface reflectance images with better elimination of terrain textures in winter seasons."

Many studies have used high-dimensional weather data to improve forecast accuracy, however, these approaches often introduce challenges such as increased computational complexity and noise from irrelevant or redundant features. This study explores the enhancement of solar power prediction using a reduced, highly relevant feature set derived from a combination of four feature selection methods and evaluates its effect on cross-city projections through transfer learning. Using various ML algorithms, we then evaluate the prediction performance in both same-city and cross-city scenarios. Our findings reveal that in same-city projections, reducing the feature set to 50% yields minimal loss in accuracy. For cross-city projections, transfer learning enhances model adaptability, achieving an improved performance with the reduced feature set compared the full set. This novel combination of feature reduction and transfer learning not only simplifies computational requirements but also lowers data collection and preprocessing costs, making predictive models more scalable. These findings provide actionable insights, showcasing a new approach to robust and interpretable solar power forecasting that has not been explored in this way before."

In this study, we constructed a NTL Downscaling Generative Adversarial Network (NTL-DSGAN) model utilizing NPP-VIIRS NTL data and multi-source spatial variables, resulting in the creation of yearly GAN-based 130-meter downscaled NPP-VIIRS (DSGAN-VIIRS) NTL data for Shanghai. When validated against 130-meter Loujia1-01 NTL imagery, our DSGAN-VIIRS NTL imagery effectively mitigates the blooming effect compared to the 500-meter NPP-VIIRS NTL data, demonstrating improved data quality. Furthermore, the DSGAN-VIIRS NTL data show stronger correlation with socioeconomic indicators, yielding higher coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) values than those of NPP-VIIRS NTL data, which is comparable to or even exceeds the performance of Luojia1-01 NTL data.

Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise-like content (speckle) with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE [1] on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model."

However, relatively few studies have applied deep learning methods to MTT based on heterogeneous sensor fusion. This paper introduces a fusion queries generation mechanism for integrating heterogeneous sensor data, enabling an end-to-end multi-target tracking (MTT) method called RIFT (Radar and Infrared sensor Fusion tracking with Transformer). The method leverages continuous multi-frame infrared (IR) measurement sequences to capture detailed target orientation motion characteristics and mitigate the impact of missed angle measurements resulting from mutual occlusion among targets. Specifically, we employed an encoder-decoder architecture to process the radar measurement sequences to generate initial state estimates, which are then combined with IR data in the fusion queries mechanism to update azimuth estimations and produce fusion queries. These queries guide the radar decoder to predict subsequent target states, enabling iterative regression that fully exploits multi-sensor inputs to achieve a high-accuracy, continuous MTT method. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional sequential filtering and existing state-of-the-art Transformer-based MTT methods."

These challenges are particularly significant in regions like Northeast China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), where climatic and geographical complexities further hinder the production of high-accuracy soil FT products. This study applies a categorical triple collocation (CTC)-based merging method to merge multi-source soil FT products (SMAP, ESDR, ERA5) from 2018 to 2020, fully accounting for nonstationary classification errors in original products. Validation using meteorological stations and six dense in-situ observation networks demonstrates that the merged product achieves more stable classification accuracy than the original products, consistently ranking among the top two in performance at most sites. This stability highlights the method's ability to reduce the impact of temporal/spatial heterogeneity in the original products. The proposed approach enhances the reliability of soil FT products and provides a robust framework for merging multi-source soil FT and other categorical variable products in related fields, particularly on a global scale where ground observation data remains sparse."

To address this problem, we propose a new POA estimation method for vegetated hilly areas based on the seven-component scattering power decomposition model (7SD).

The method transforms the DOA estimation of FH signals into that of single-frequency signals, significantly reducing computational complexity and laying a foundation for effective interference suppression. The approach begins by classifying FH pulse signals based on their carrier frequencies. Next, the DFP technique is employed to extract the difference-frequency signal, effectively aligning the carrier frequencies of each pulse and eliminating intra-pulse modulation.

    "abstract": "The moving target imaging is difficult due to its noncooperative property, which poses a great challenge to SAR systems. In this paper, a moving target imaging method based on keystone (KT) transform is proposed to realize fast refocusing. Firstly, the consistent compensation processing of the stationary scene and the moving target is completed in the range-frequency domain according to the platform parameters, and the echo information of a single moving target is then extracted from the SAR image, and the range migration processing is completed by using slow time reversal, KT transform and second-order KT (SOKT) transform. Finally, the echo signal falling into the same range unit is extracted for azimuth focusing processing, and a two-dimensional high-resolution moving target image is obtained. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by simulation and real data results."

RFI source localization provides crucial prior information for RFI mitigation and spectrum management.

To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes an RFI intersection localization method based on phase matching and grid search. It avoids the problem of multiple phase-wrapping and effectively reduces the impact of ambiguity values. The localization accuracy is validated in measured dual-channel SAR data with simulated RFI, which yield only one cluster of points within the valid localization area and achieve high localization accuracy."

This study evaluates the performance of an ultra-low power boost converter using stochastic simulations: Gaussian Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Worst-Case Analysis. The average output voltage was 4.20 V, with variations from 3.10 V to 4.87 V. Gaussian Analysis showed the highest stability, with the smallest standard deviation of 0.1437 V and the narrowest voltage range $(4.80-5.00 \\mathrm{~V})$, making it the most suitable for precise voltage regulation in biomedical devices. Monte Carlo Simulation revealed moderate stability with wider fluctuations, while Worst-Case Analysis exposed significant deviations under extreme conditions. These results confirm Gaussian Analysis as the best method for ensuring stable voltage, while the other methods help identify variability and risk. Future work includes physical testing, validation with real biological data, and developing adaptive or AI-based controllers to improve voltage stability."

In recent years, numerous models have been developed based on the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and enhanced by integrating attention-based mechanisms for SAR image segmentation. Pyramid Attention Network (PAN) is a recent attention-based model for computer vision tasks. This paper presents a fine-tuned version of the PAN architecture for SAR image segmentation and compares its performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Sentinel-1 data in combination with CORINE Land Cover (CLC) maps from the BigEarthNet dataset is used for model evaluation. The training data include over 1,500 images representing five land cover classes: Artificial Surfaces, Agricultural Areas, Forest and Seminatural Areas, Wetlands, and Water Bodies. This analysis highlights the strengths of these models in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that the PAN model outperforms the others, exhibiting superior accuracy and enhanced feature discrimination for classifying land cover types."

Drone-based TomoSAR systems, owing to their flexibility, have garnered considerable attention. However, urban environments present challenges due to strong reflections from buildings, leading to severe multipath effects. Traditionally, multipath-induced ghost points are treated as noise and discarded, hindering accurate reconstruction. This study aims to transform multipath from a detrimental factor to a valuable asset for improving urban scene analysis. A polar coordinate model for low-altitude scenarios is introduced. Then, by performing Local outlier factor (LOF) detection on each look angle, multipath signals are identified during the 3D imaging process. Finally, the multipath virtual points are relocated to their true positions during the 3D imaging process. Experimental results demonstrate a 0.1 reduction in 3D entropy, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. This research highlights the potential of exploiting multipath phenomena to enhance TomoSAR imaging in complex urban environments."

Although recent studies have begun transitioning from suppressing multipath effects to lever-aging them, there remains limited exploration of the conditions under which multipath effects can be maximally utilized. Furthermore, most existing approaches that exploit multipath effects rely heavily on prior knowledge of building layouts, lacking adaptability to diverse geometric structures. To address these issues, this study first introduces the signal model of Array InSAR and analyzes the relationship between NLOS imaging coverage and the vertical height and horizontal distance of a UAV relative to the target area during low-altitude observations in urban canyon environments. Building on this foundation, we further propose an NLOS building layout relocation method that does not rely on prior layout information. Finally, electromagnetic simulation data are generated to validate the proposed system model and algorithm."

Traditional ground-based tree height measurement methods are time-consuming and have limited coverage. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provide a cost-effective and flexible alternative that is capable of generating high-resolution point cloud data. This study develops a method for extracting tree heights based on drone point cloud data. The method utilizes photogrammetry techniques and the Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm to generate point cloud data, and employs a cuboid filtering method to separate ground points from tree points. Tree height extraction is conducted by fitting a model to the ground points to predict ground elevation. The method was validated in two representative plots with different tree densities. The results showed that in the sparsely vegetated area after filtering, the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> reached 0.9873, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was 0.3044, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.379522; in the densely vegetated area after filtering, the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> reached 0.9587, the MAE was 0.96, and the RMSE was 1.1141.

However, the control of this type of converter is more complex to design than that of single-output converters, and the results presented in the literature are difficult to compare due to different contexts (voltages, load currents, size of passive components, etc.). This paper presents a comparative study of control strategies for a Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) DC-DC converter used in microcontroller power supplies. The power stage of a SIMO converter adaptable to various control topologies is modeled and high-level analog control structures are implemented. By analyzing transient and steady-state performance metrics in a standardized simulation context, the most suitable solutions can be identified. This approach provides a fair evaluation of topologies, establishing a foundation for developing robust, efficient multi-output power converters. Based on this evaluation, a new control topology is proposed and implemented on a transistor-level design."

The proposed method integrates K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering for user demographic profiling with matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The system is evaluated against established baselines (SVD, User-Based CF, Neural CF) across four key performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline models, with significant improvements in accuracy metrics when scaling from MovieLens 100K to 1M. Precision increased by $3.91 \\%$, recall by $20.99 \\%$, and F1-score by $15.12 \\%$. Notably, the recall improvement indicates an enhanced capability to capture diverse user preferences. However, the diversity score remained constant at 0.6666 across both datasets, suggesting that algorithmic design, rather than data volume, predominantly influences recommendation variety. Comparative analysis reveals that while the proposed method excels in accuracy, it yields slightly lower diversity than User-Based CF, highlighting a potential trade-off. These findings confirm that incorporating demographic data enhances collaborative filtering effectiveness, particularly for addressing cold-start issues and capturing broader user preferences. This research contributes to more accurate and personalized recommendation systems by leveraging demographic insights within a scalable collaborative filtering framework."

In this study, a multi-label vegetation segmentation dataset (MultiVeg) was constructed to reflect the geographical characteristics of South Korea, primarily consisting of urban and forest regions. The dataset was created through handcrafted labeling and visual inspection, and oversampling techniques were applied to mitigate class imbalance issues. To validate the quality and utility of the MultiVeg dataset, performance evaluation was conducted using the DeepLabV3+ model. In identifying the target classes of tree and grass, MultiVeg was shown to outperform or exhibit higher reliability compared to benchmark datasets (Wuhan Urban Semantic Understanding (WUSU), Zurich summer). Future research aims to enhance the performance of MultiVeg by collecting additional regional data to increase the diversity of the grass class, which showed relatively lower accuracy compared to the tree class. Furthermore, the multi-temporal data in MultiVeg will be utilized to perform precise geometric corrections and expand the dataset into a time-series vegetation change detection dataset.

Existing feature point matching methods face challenges in small UAV target registration due to scarce feature points, small size, and complex backgrounds, leading to unstable outcomes. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a cross-modal image registration (CMIR) model, which consists of a multi-scale feature point extraction network (MSFEN) and a feature refinement matching module (FRMM). In this method, optical images are first transformed into pseudo-infrared images using a modality transformation network (MTN) to reduce modality disparities. The MSFEN then extracts robust feature points for preliminary matching, while the FRMM refines the matches by analyzing the relative positions and local structures of the points. Experimental results show the method excels in small UAV target image registration, effectively addressing challenges like scarce feature points, small target size, and complex backgrounds."

Using ML techniques, we achieve a speedup of over 400 times compared to HSPICE for the characterization of digital blocks, using which complex cell designs can be analyzed across various input test combinations, significantly saving the time required for extensive simulations."

However, existing methods lack a systematic mechanism to leverage the complementary semantic content and discriminative discrepancy information embedded in vision-language features, limiting their capacity for robust pseudo-change perception. To tackle these challenges, we propose CEDCLIP, an innovative content-enhanced and differential learning framework for remote sensing change detection. CED-CLIP introduces three key modules: a Change Feature Module for flexible extraction of differential features from bitemporal images, a Change Detection Decoder Module that incorporates content information to refine context-aware change representations and a Vision-Language Interaction Module that integrates visual and textual features to enhance semantic understanding. The modular design ensures seamless compatibility with existing algorithms and facilitates efficient adaptation to various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that CED-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance, paving the way for robust multimodal learning in change detection."

Methane emissions from oil and gas facilities and landfills are analyzed to evaluate the consistency and precision of the sensors and temporal variability of the source. Landfills, characterized by diffuse and stable emissions, and dynamic oil and gas facilities, subject to operational variability, provide contrasting use cases for emission monitoring. Emission rates are quantified using the Integrated Mass Enhancement (IME) model and validated across satellites with overlapping acquisitions. This study highlights the advantages and limitations of each satellite system, emphasizing the critical role of multi-sensor integration in bridging temporal and spatial observation gaps.

This study focuses on plotting time series dynamics and validating SWORD water levels for Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri barrages against in-situ and DAHITI products. The statistical analysis between SWOT and in-situ indicates a good agreement for the Sukkur barrage, with an R of 0.98 and a Mean Absolute Error (MSE) of 0.74 meters. For Guddu Barrage, a comparison with in-situ data yielded an R of 0.90 and an MAE of 0.44 meters. Similarly, for Kotri Barrage, the R and MAE were 0.98 and 0.60 meters, respectively. The discrepancies may be due to in-situ data handling or due to SWORD-derived water levels. The water surface elevation (WSE) is averaged between two adjacent nodes. This averaging may not capture abrupt changes in water levels caused by obstructions such as barrages."

However, their ability to capture global feature representations is limited, posing challenges for complex land cover classification. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid network structure named SOCANet, which integrates convolutional operations with linear self-attention mechanisms. In detail, the network is divided into encoder and decoder two parts. In the encoder, a cross-modal feature fusion module and a multi-level feature extraction module are integrated. The multi-level feature extraction module adopts a parallel structure and combines CNN and focused linear attention to improve the feature expression ability. The decoder part consists of two classifiers, which are responsible for different levels of feature classification tasks. Furthermore, the Nanjishan Wetland Nature Reserve region is used to verified the effective of our proposed method. Experimental results indicate that SOCANet achieves a comprehensive classification accuracy (OA) of 97% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.959, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline methods. Notably, the proposed approach excels in distinguishing complex land cover types, such as carex, mudflat, reeds, et al., offering a novel solution for feature learning and fusion in intricate scenarios."

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a current control strategy utilizing a fixed-time augmented resonant extended state observer (FARESO) to detect current disturbances and mitigate their effects through redesigned control law. Initially, the proposed method introduces a measured current integral term as the augmented state variable to decouple the interaction between current measurement noise and high observer gain. Additionally, to enhance the observation and suppression for harmonic disturbances, the quasi-generalized integrator term is incorporated in the observer. Furthermore, recognizing the exponentially asymptotic convergence characteristic of the conventional observers, this study proposes an enhanced nonlinear correction term for the observer to ensure fixed-time convergence of the state estimation error. This modification accelerates the observer's convergence rate, thereby improving both observation and control bandwidth. Finally, experimental results obtained from a PMSM test rig validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."

This approach deviates from existing methods, which focus on induced perturbations on RGB images and considering all bands collectively. Experimental results on the EuroSAT dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with various perturbation levels, demonstrate that overall accuracy, 96.72% in the absence of attacks, can drop by 2.59% up to 16.68% depending on the targeted band.

Despite the growing interest in greenspace research, gaps remain in understanding how scale and zoning effects influence the drivers of greenspace exposure, posing challenges for equitable and effective planning. This study investigated the spatial patterns and driving factors of greenspace exposure across four administrative levels in China (province, city, county, and town) using buffer radii of 100m, 500m, 1000m, and 1500m. Through multiscale remote sensing observations, local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity model, we examined the modifiable areal unit problem to evaluate scale and zoning effects on greenspace exposure. Results revealed significant geographical disparities, with higher exposure in southwest China and lower exposure in southeastern coastal and northwestern arid regions. Spatial heterogeneity and dependence intensified at finer administrative levels, with Moran’s I increasing from 0.400 at the provincial scale to 0.764 at the township scale. While natural factors dominated the spatial pattern of greenspace exposure at broader scales, anthropogenic influences prevailed at finer scales, underscoring the critical role of zoning-specific analyses. Overall, this study bridged research gaps by providing a multiscale perspective on greenspace exposure and its drivers, offering practical insights for policymakers and urban planners to design equitable and sustainable green space strategies."

Multitemporal SAR imagery was processed to detect structural changes in the forest canopy and compare them with mapped logging infrastructure. The methodology was applied to three study areas in the Jamari National Forest, Brazil: two selectively logged areas and one undisturbed area serving as a control. Results showed significant canopy reductions of 6.90% and 4.11% in the logged areas, compared to 0.16% in the control area. Intersection rates of 60.94% and 51.65% confirmed the spatial alignment between SAR-detected impacted areas and logging infrastructure.

The language-guided context encoder enhances the referred object contexts by releasing feature dimensions and aligning multi-modal information. Meanwhile, the adaptive cross-modal decoder plays a vital role in the reasoning process by adaptively selecting the visual attention ranges to query global and local information.

Using multiple features to distinguish targets from clutter is an effective method. Thus, creating a specialized classifier that can handle unequal training samples, especially ergodic sea clutter versus non-ergodic target returns, is crucial. This paper proposes a weighted convex hull tree structure with three parts: convex hull, weight, and threshold decision. First, features are combined to form multiple three-dimensional convex hulls. Second, different convex hulls are weighted based on their detection capabilities about simulated target samples. Finally, a test statistic is built using weights and sample distances to control false alarms. The algorithm uses measured sea clutter and simulated target data, ensuring robustness. On the open IPIX database and a self-collected UAV dataset, the proposed detector outperforms other feature-based detectors on the performance and computation cost."

These methods mitigate viewpoint discrepancies to some extent, but the transformed images still exhibit issues such as a limited perceptual range, which hinders subsequent matching. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel cross-view retrieval method that introduces the Curved-BEV transformation, effectively narrowing the domain gap between street-view images and satellite imagery. This transformation adjusts street-view images to a form more consistent with the satellite perspective, thereby reducing the impact of viewpoint differences and improving image matching accuracy. During the training, the method employs the InfoNCE loss function from contrastive learning, which maximizes the mutual information between image pairs. This enhances the distinguishability of positive and negative image pairs, improving the representation of features in both street-view and satellite images and strengthening the discriminative power of the image features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance on the benchmark datasets CVACT and CVUSA. Specifically, the Curved-BEV transformation improves R@1 by 2.46% over the existing BEV method and by 1.58% over the commonly used polar transformation, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method provides a more accurate localization solution for specific scenarios."

    "abstract": "Model predictive control has emerged as a suitable alternative for controlling power converters. Today, several predictive control strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance and efficiency of the converter, building upon advances made over its predecessors. This paper presents a comparative study of three predictive control strategies -Model-Based Predictive Control (MBPC), Sequential Model Predictive Control (SMPC), and Indirect Model Predictive Control (IMPC) — applied to input and output current regulation in a Direct Matrix Converter (DMC), assessing the degree of advancement between them. The comparison focuses on defining the system's behaviour in terms of control performance, computational efficiency, and harmonic distortion under realistic operating conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that IMPC offers superior current tracking accuracy, minimal ripple, and the lowest Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) among the three strategies. In contrast, SMPC, while eliminating weighting factors, exhibits the highest THD and reference-tracking errors. Finally, this study highlights IMPC as a practical approach for high-performance control in DMC over the other two strategies."

This study conducts a sensitivity analysis on an aerial image dataset from Taiwan to determine how input variability impacts rice semantic segmentation using a UNet-VGG16 model. We analyze three input factors: rice coverage percentage, cloud presence, and Near-Infrared (NIR) value histograms. The findings reveal that a balanced rice coverage percentage, high-quality dataset with normal NIR values and no cloud cover achieves the best performance, yielding a testing Kappa score of 0.815. In contrast, class imbalance or abnormal data conditions lead to underfitting and significantly reduced model performance. This research provides a practical framework for data preprocessing, demonstrating that optimizing input data is essential for developing robust segmentation models for agricultural applications."

This method utilizes a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator, fine-tuned with LAB color space preprocessing, combining luminance and chrominance to differentiate real and fake images. A different preprocessing pipeline guarantees the model will handle the variations in datasets through \"Lab\" normalization of color spaces and paired images preparation. Moreover, balancing adversarial and L1 losses, LumiPix achieves high-quality translations with enhanced perceptual fidelity and pixel-level accuracy, thus providing a reliable solution for applications in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response."

    "abstract": "Transmit/receive (TR) modules in active electronically scanned array radar systems face critical vibration-induced fatigue issues, which are further aggravated by elevated operational temperatures that accelerate solder joint degradation. To address these interconnected thermomechanical failure mechanisms, particle dampers emerge as a promising vibration mitigation strategy in TR modules, owing to their ability to dissipate energy through both impact and friction mechanisms, exhibit temperature insensitivity, and provide effective broadband vibration attenuation. This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating particle dampers within the PCB enclosure of TR modules in increasing the fatigue life of SAC305 solder interconnects subjected to combined thermal and vibrational loads. A comprehensive methodology integrates experimental modal analysis, finite element (FE) modeling, and frequency domain fatigue life prediction. The particle damper parameters are optimized via artificial neural networks trained on experimental vibration test data, followed by FE model validation and calibration against experimental test data (with/without damper). Stress tensors from Abaqus frequency-domain steady-state dynamic analyses are exported to FE-SAFE, enabling solder fatigue life estimation. The results show that the integration of particle damper within the PCB enclosure of the TR module reduces the von Mises stresses in the most critical solder joint by 20–25% and increases the fatigue life upto 187% under severe thermal vibrational load. These findings underscore the important role of particle dampers in extending the operational reliability of high-power electronics in aerospace and defense applications."

However, existing methods fail to support efficient multi-object arrangement in highly occluded scenes with densely packed candidate objects through controller-free natural interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient, scene-aware multi object arrangement method (MOA) designed for fast, precise, and convenient object arrangement. First, MOA introduces an importance-driven multi-object initial selection algorithm that assigns higher spatiotemporally correlated object importance (IMP) to target objects, establishing a natural multi-object initial selection mode that enables quick and accurate selection of high IMP objects. Subsequently, it presents an auxiliary-structure guided multi-object manipulation algorithm that constructs an auxiliary manipulation structure to assist subsequent multi-object manipulation, alongside a multi-modal interaction mode that facilitates swift and natural manipulation. Compared to state of-the-art controller-free and controller-based methods, MOA significantly improves task performance, reduces task load, and enhances convenience in complex multi-object arrangement scenes involving hundreds of highly occluded objects need to be arranged."

To overcome this issue, we propose a novel network with similarity perception termed edge-guided refinement network (ERNet), which distinguishes the edge region of salient objects from coarse to fine through two-stage similarity calculation. Firstly, we introduce the adaptive uncertainty calibration module (AUCM), which utilizes the proposed similarity-based edge perception mechanism (SEPM) to adaptively calibrate edge uncertain information. Secondly, to effectively capture global semantic information, we propose the hierarchical semantic reconstruction module (HSRM), which comprehensively correlates different levels of semantic clues from both internal and external perspectives. Finally, to supplement the local detail of salient objects, we design the dynamic detail interaction module (DDIM), which dynamically extracts detail information of objects at different scales. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets have demonstrated the remarkable superiority of our ERNet compared to 30 state-of-the-art models.

The structure exhibits a resonance mode similar to the 2<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\theta $</tex-math> </inline-formula> vibrational mode of a disk structure but with a larger proof mass. By incorporating a decoupling frame and a linear capacitive design, the system enables large-amplitude displacement actuation and detection, thereby reducing mechanical thermal noise. In order to overcome the problem of optimizing the order of multiple interference modes caused by multiple masses, this study uses the Lagrangian multibody dynamics method to establish an eight-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of the eight-mass structure and calculates the modal order of the resonator. The theoretical resonance frequencies, calculated based on structural parameters, show a deviation of only 3.95% compared with finite element simulations. Using this approach, the frequency difference between the operational mode and parasitic modes reaches 3.45 kHz, effectively preventing interference from parasitic modes. To address quadrature errors caused by stiffness coupling, this article proposes a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) closed-loop quadrature suppression scheme incorporating electrostatic stiffness. The LQR-based feedback mechanism enables high-precision adjustment of electrostatic stiffness while ensuring system stability.

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are a cornerstone technology in the rapidly growing low-altitude economy, with significant applications in logistics, smart cities, and emergency response. However, their deployment is constrained by challenges in secure communication, dynamic group coordination, and resource constraints. Although there are various cryptographic techniques, efficient and scalable group key management plays a critical role in secure task allocation in UAV swarms. Existing group key agreement schemes, both symmetric and asymmetric, often fail to adequately address these challenges due to their reliance on centralized control, high computational overhead, sender restrictions, and insufficient protection against physical attacks. To address these issues, we propose PCDCB (Pairing-free Certificateless Dynamic Contributory Broadcast encryption), a blockchain-assisted lightweight key management scheme designed for UAV swarm task allocation. PCDCB is particularly suitable for swarm operations as it supports efficient one-to-many broadcast of task commands, enables dynamic node join/leave, and eliminates key escrow by combining certificateless cryptography with Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for hardware-bound key regeneration. Blockchain is used to maintain tamper-resistant update tables and ensure auditability, while a privacy-preserving mechanism with pseudonyms and a round mapping table provides task anonymity and unlinkability. Comprehensive security analysis confirms that PCDCB is secure and resistant to multiple attacks. Performance evaluation shows that, in large-scale swarm scenarios (n = 100), PCDCB reduces the cost of group key computation by 54.4% (up to 96.9%) and reduces the time to generate the decryption keys by at least 29.7%. In addition, PCDCB achieves the lowest communication cost among all compared schemes and demonstrates strong scalability with increasing group size."

    "abstract": "Visible light communication (VLC) integrates illumination and communication, offering significant potential for 6 G mobile communications. In 6 G communications, reliability and low latency are critical. To meet these demands, finite blocklength codewords are employed for data transmission. For indoor VLC scenarios, multiple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) serve as transmitters, with each transmitter operating under distinct optical power constraints tailored to user requirements. In this paper, a multidimensional constellation design based on geometric shaping is proposed for multi-input single-output (MISO) VLC with per-LED optical power constraints. This design employs truncated cubic shaping to design the equivalent transmitted signal and decomposes it into transmitted signals using a partition-based greedy decomposition. The proposed scheme designs signals in the finite blocklength regime while adhering to per-LED optical power constraints. Simulation results for indoor MISO VLC systems demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme over benchmark schemes and quantify the performance gains as well as the gap to the Shannon limit."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown significant potential in advancing hyperspectral image classification. However, to enable the adaptive recognition of new land cover categories, class-incremental learning (CIL) plays a crucial role in hyperspectral image classification. Despite its potential, CIL faces limitations such as the memory constraints and data privacy concerns. Furthermore, existing CIL methods often rely on static adaptation, employing a predetermined parameter framework to process sequentially incoming data, which increases the risk of overfitting to the current session. To address these challenges, we first propose a pseudo-sample generation network to prevent the knowledge forgetting of previous classes and enhance the diversity of new classes. Then we employ an adaptive selective state space models (SSMs) projector that adjusts its projection parameters based on intermediate features to enable dynamic adaptation. This SSMs projector design allows the model to preserve essential characteristics of base classes, while dynamically adapting to the feature shifts of new classes. Extensive experimentals and analysis on representative dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In order to improve the imaging efficiency and accuracy for geosynchronous-low-orbit (GEO-LEO) bi-static terrain matching synthetic aperture radar (TMSAR), a generalized fast back-projection algorithm (GFBPA) is proposed in this paper. The imaging grid is creatively composed of fan-shaped cells along the orientation of terrain matching scene, and meshed as a curved surface, instead of a plane, within the Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) coordinate system. In this configuration, the coarse-resolution grid used for TMSAR sub-apertures back projection can be obtained by down-sampling the full-resolution grid directly along its vertical direction, and the mismatches in the back-projection operation caused by ground curvature and terrain relief can be alleviated significantly. During the GFBPA processing, the two-step spectrum compression filters in three-dimension (3-D) space are re-derived to avoid sub-aperture image spectrum aliasing under Cartesian coordinates effectively, and the multi-stage image fusion is adopted to maximize the acceleration of the entire operation. An experiment is conducted in the end of this paper, which demonstrates the validation of the proposed algorithm."

This approach maintains transparency for a conventional 3-phase reference input, in terms of the required adjustments to maintain the MMC balanced and Circulating Currents under control, when using Phase Shifted Carrier Modulation (PS-PWM) as this scheme allows for direct manipulation of individual SM duty cycle values. The use of filtered samples of the voltages of the SM capacitors is shown to offer a strong simplification of the control of circulating currents when using PS-PWM."

To address these issues, this paper proposes an approximation function to ensure that the actual output voltage closely approximates the reference voltage. The approximation function is derived based on the law of conservation of energy: by deriving the area equivalence rules for the voltage vector trajectory, comparing the output voltage vector with the sinusoidal reference voltage vector, the problem is reformulated as a least squares function approximation. Specifically, the voltage projection onto real-axis is modeled as the least squares approximation function with respect to the angle and amplitude. The sine wave is to be approximated and the least squares approximation error is applied to optimize angle and amplitude. Finally, simulation analysis and bench experiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."

Individual tree segmentation is a key prerequisite for estimating individual tree structural parameters using backpack LiDAR. However, most of the current individual tree segmentation methods are based on airborne or terrestrial LiDAR, and these methods cannot be directly applied to individual tree segmentation from backpack LiDAR point clouds. Therefore, this study proposes a method for individual tree segmentation from backpack LiDAR point clouds. The basic idea of this method is to first detect the under-branch trunk, then separate the under-branch trunk from the canopy, over-segment the canopy, use the information of under-branch trunk to correct the over-segmentation results of the canopy, and finally combine the under-branch trunk with the canopy to form an individual tree. Experiments show that the F1 score of the segmentation results in three areas with different levels of tree density are all above 0.95, indicating that this method has practical application capabilities in the field of individual tree segmentation."

Deviations from ergonomic sitting positions include a bowed head, elbows positioned away from the sides of the body, and sitting without back support. As a result, workers can experience injuries, such as lower back pain and musculoskeletal system disorders. The application of ergonomic sitting positions enables the muscles to adapt and receive the necessary oxygenated blood flow, allowing the body to become more relaxed while working and increasing worker productivity. This research utilizes computer vision and machine learning approaches as a solution to the problem. This research aims to implement the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, utilizing the MobileNetV2 pre-training architecture, to classify ergonomic and nonergonomic sitting positions. The total images used was 1620, with each class totaling 810 images. The images are divided into three types of data with a ratio of 80:10:10. Two CNN models with custom classifier heads were trained using hyperparameters such as the RMSProp optimizer, a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 32, and 100 epochs. Model 1 was selected as the best model, achieving a training accuracy of 96%, a training loss of 9%, a validation accuracy of $95 \\%$, and a validation loss of $13 \\%$. The model was tested using a confusion matrix with test data, yielding the following test results: an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 95%, a recall of 95%, and an F1-score of 95%."

It is worth considering how to simultaneously and fully utilize the characteristics of optical and radar images to improve the recognition rate of ships. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new radar-to-optical image conversion and fusion algorithm for ships based on U-GAT-IT by utilizing the strong correlation between ISAR images and optical images.

    "abstract": "Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) are a feasible and practical solution to realize the electrification of passenger cars and thus reduce fuel consumption. The optimal fuel economy of PHEVs relies on energy management strategies (EMSs), which coordinate the power of the engine and the motor based on the engine efficiency map. This paper proposes a pattern regarding the impact of engine efficiency map deviation on the optimal control of EMS based on an analysis based on Pontryagin's minimum principle. The pattern is that when the engine efficiency is improved in the region above the maximum efficiency torque, for an EMS optimal control with a state of charge (SOC) that first decreases and then increases, the deviated optimal control will result in a lower SOC trajectory. Then the pattern was applied to improve the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. An engine dedicated to PHEV was tested on a bench to obtain engine efficiency maps with different fuels and a series/parallel PHEV was modeled for the simulation of EMS.

    "abstract": "Multi-spectral images (MSIs) efficiently delineate the feature of interest if the appropriate band imageries are in hand. Due to the several spectral ranges of MSI, the different terrestrial features respond differently in the other spectral range. The spectral response of algae is entirely different from the water in the marine ecosystem. In this study, we propose to use principal component analysis-based features with time differencing operations to determine the most useful bands in the multispectral image (MSI) data for the study of algal bloom. The useful bands obtained from the proposed strategy show significant overlap (of up to 0.429) with the time differencing-based strategies mentioned in the literature in terms of Jaccard, Resemblance, Overlap, and Sorensen-Dice scores, suggesting that the proposed approach correctly and efficiently (as PCA-features are used instead of original features) finds these useful bands with the most recent scheme. From the experiments, we determine that B8, B8a, B6, B7, and B5 are the most useful bands in the Sentinel-2 MSI data. We propose using these bands to train different change detection classifiers to detect and monitor algae growth in the oceans."

Therefore, this paper proposes a practical method for implementing distributed node selection criteria in a network of multiple energy-harvesting nodes and a base station. While we apply this method to a criterion that focuses solely on the current energy levels of the nodes, given our emphasis on energy harvesting wireless networks, the method can be easily adapted to other criteria, such as those that also consider channel conditions. The results show that the proposed method performs as expected. However, the method cannot prevent duplicate transmissions caused by nodes having the same or relatively close energy battery levels."

Wayang Kulit has existed and developed rapidly since the 10th century. Wayang Kulit, one of Indonesia cultural treasures recognized by UNESCO as a Cultural Heritage, is currently facing a tough challenge. The decreasing number of wayang kulit performances has resulted in a decrease in the number of spectators. This also causes a lack of public knowledge, especially among the younger generation, regarding wayang kulit. Related to the decreasing socialization and implementation of digital technology related to the Indonesian wayang kulit. To address this, we developed WayangEDU, a mobile application that employs markerless Augmented Reality (AR) based on the SLAM approach. WayangEDU serves as an interactive educational medium to teach users about Wayang Kulit characters and stage props, providing a novel learning experience. We conducted both AR Performance and User Satisfaction tests. The AR performance results demonstrate that WayangEDU runs smoothly on all tested Android devices, particularly mid-range and higher-end models. User Satisfaction tests showed significant improvements in application consistency, error handling, and search functionality. These findings indicate that the AR-based WayangEDU application effectively bridges the gap between traditional culture and modern technology, supporting the preservation of Indonesian Wayang Kulit heritage."

    "abstract": "The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources (RES) has resulted in a reduced contribution from conventional generation units in the electrical grid, leading to a gradual decline in microgrid inertia. This reduction poses significant challenges to frequency stability within microgrid power systems. To address this issue, this paper introduces a virtual inertia rotor technique designed to effectively compensate for the loss of system inertia. The proposed method utilizes a Tilt-Integral-Derivative (TID) controller and a Fractional-Order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (FOPID) controller for load frequency control. However, due to the high penetration of RESs or sudden load fluctuations, the microgrid system frequency may experience unexpected deviations. To mitigate these risks, the proposed technique is integrated with a frequency protection relay scheme, ensuring the dynamic security of the microgrid, particularly under critical conditions. The effectiveness of this coordination is validated using MATLAB simulations under various load and generation imbalance scenarios."

    "abstract": "The equivalence between the space-vector pulse width modulation (PWM) and the carrier-based PWM can be realised through appropriate offset voltage injection to sinusoidal phase reference waveforms. Carrier-based modulation is generally favoured in multilevel converters as the complexity and resource utilization of the space vector PWM is high in comparison. For two-level inverters, min-max offset injection is known to reduce current THD whereas for multilevel converters, like the cascaded H-bridge converter (CHB), the same result is generally achieved through the double min-max offset injection. However, this result is not always true for all regions of the modulation index range when the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the load phase current is evaluated. This paper validates a previously proposed second min-max offset injection as optimal in conjunction with the level-shifted in-phase disposition PWM strategy. It is shown to achieve the lowest THD of the phase current waveforms for a three-phase CHB converter operating in the linear modulation index range below unity. However, in the overmodulation region, the double min-max injection is still preferred. The results have been confirmed experimentally using a three-phase nine-level CHB converter with an RL load."

Therefore, this study utilizes the Lagrangian water vapor tracking model to analyze the transport pathways of water vapor during the rainy season from 2020 to 2024. By quantifying the intensity of water vapor transport (QVT) and employing concentration-weighted trajectory (WCWT) analysis, the study further identifies potential source regions of water vapor. The results reveal that: (1) the water vapor responsible for July precipitation in Beijing primarily originates from Eurasian continental and oceanic pathways, including the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea; (2) the westerly wind belt plays a dominant role in water vapor transport, while the southeast monsoon significantly enhances the contribution of oceanic water vapor; (3) reduced precipitation in low-value years (2020 and 2022) is linked to weakened water vapor transport from the ocean, attributed to a weakened southeast monsoon. This analysis confirms that the water vapor transport mechanism during the July rainy season is shaped by a combination of westerly transport and the monsoon system, with oceanic water vapor making a notably significant contribution to precipitation."

    "abstract": "Glacial lakes serve as a key indicator for analyzing the risks associated with ice-mass loss, glacier retreat, and the potential for glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Existing glacial lake mapping techniques in mountainous regions primarily rely on manual or semi-automated threshold-based methods or the use of highly expensive satellite imagery, which are limited in scalability, efficiency, and financial reach for common researchers. At the heart of the proposed approach is the ‘GLDeepNet’, a fully automated deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) specially designed for glacial lake mapping using publicly, readily available satellite data, including multispectral, thermal, microwave, and digital elevation models (DEM). Its architecture comprises of 2D convolutional layers with carefully selected hyperparameters. An important contribution is the pre-processing step, which includes an optimal choice of the spectral bands and adequate processing of the SAR data to generate the input to ‘GLDeepNet’. An equally noteworthy contribution is the application of morphological operations as a part of the post-processing step. 1050 images have been trained in the eastern Himalayan range, with testing done on 750 images across an entirely different region—the north-central Himalayas, which has significantly greater vulnerability to glacial lakes than other trans-Himalayan ranges. The model produces an accuracy (0.98), precision (0.9) recall (0.94) and a strong correlation (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.91) between predicted and reference lake boundaries. Hence the proposed approach offers a scalable, automated solution for glacial lake mapping across large regions, which is rightfully a feather in its cap, making it stand well apart from other such approaches for glacial lake detection."

    "abstract": "Subpixel target detection in hyperspectral imaging is a binary classification with an abundance of pixels for training the background class but only one pixel for training the target class. The imbalance in sample sizes of training pixels for the two classes is a problem in artificial neural networks. The objective of this paper is to mathematically develop a new algorithm for subpixel target detection of rare targets in hyperspectral imaging and assess its performance. The algorithm is derived from a deep neural network with three hidden layers. The objective function in conventional neural networks is typically solved numerically using a gradient descent method with a fixed step size. The iteration using a fixed step size may lead to divergence in subpixel target detection. The unconstrained minimization problem of the objective function is solved numerically using a gradient descent method with a new variable step size. Additional subpixel target pixels for training the target class are generated from the single full target pixel using synthetic signature modeling. The decision boundary for the deep neural network is nonlinear for the transformed pixels at the input layer. Experimental results from a hyperspectral image are presented to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the algorithm can perform better than conventional algorithms, which are based on generalized likelihood ratio test. Lastly, we note our new variable step size improves convergence."

However, there are still many challenges due to the complexity of lithological compositions, the similar image characteristics of different lithology, and surface conditions, such as weathering and vegetation cover, which complicate the lithological classification process. Hyperspectral remote sensing, with its advantages of high spectral dimensional data, greatly enhances the capability for fine identification and discrimination of terrestrial features. Gaofen-5B satellite launched at Sept. 2021, carried the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) offers broad coverage and extremely high hyperspectral resolution, which promote the needs for large scale lithological mapping and mineral identification. We propose a method which combined superpixel segmentation with random forest (SLIC-RF) for lithological classification. Cluster pixels with similar features into a super-pixel region, then create a training sample set for random forest classification. Traditional and machine learning methods are used as competing methods, trained on GF-5B principal component analysis (PCA) results, and evaluated results according to training sets, overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits a significant effectiveness in the lithological classification of bedrock exposure areas. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method based on superpixel segmentation and random forests demonstrates higher accuracy and robustness, enabling better discrimination of lithology with similar features and providing clearer lithological boundaries."

Effective management relies on scalable monitoring solutions, whereby traditional field surveys are labour-intensive and costly. Drone-based remote detection offers a promising alternative; however, detection performance is influenced by spatial resolution. Finer resolutions provide greater detail at the expense of scalability, while coarser resolutions risk a loss of accuracy. This study investigates the impact of spatial resolution on Siam weed detection using drone-captured RGB imagery processed with the YOLOv5s deep learning model. Detection performance was evaluated at four spatial resolutions (2 cm, 4 cm, 8 cm, and 12 cm), and the assessment utilised precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics. Results demonstrate that while finer resolutions (2 cm, 4 cm) enhance detail, they are prone to higher false-positive rates, whereas coarser resolutions (12 cm) struggle to detect smaller or sparsely distributed occurrences effectively. The 8 cm resolution achieved the best balance, with an F1-Score of 0.92, optimising accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency. These findings provide practical guidance for refining drone-based monitoring workflows and advancing invasive species management strategies."

However, privacy operations such as differential privacy mechanisms that inject noise into node features or graph structures to protect sensitive information, and distribution shifts in graph data pose tremendous security risks for the wide application of GNN models. Current researches mainly focus on defending the out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks through robust adversarial training and graph structure purification. Nonetheless, privacy perturbations of graph structures may render OOD attacks more deceptive by obfuscating the distinctiveness of nodes, leading to the failure of existing defense methods. To address these shortcomings, we propose an environment-adaptive representation interaction (EARI) scheme that strengthens the privacy perception of GNNs. Specifically, our scheme leverages the interaction between non-private and private data to enable targeted embedding propagation by the guidance of confidence score feedback. Subsequently, the representation-enriched topological aggregation is implemented to capture more discriminative features by exploiting multi-hop neighborhoods rather than stacked multilayers. Finally, the generalization-enhanced cluster-wise adaptation learning is leveraged to highlight the invariant correlations from nodes across different environments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can enhance the capability of learning representations from privacy-protected graph data, enabling GNNs to effectively defend against deceptive OOD attacks on various graph-structured datasets. Moreover, we reveal that the utilization of interactive topological aggregation can extremely enrich the diversity and guarantee the effectiveness for graph representations."

Twenty-two vegetation and radar-based indices were computed within the Google Earth Engine environment, capturing dynamic canopy, moisture, and phenological changes. Gradient time series (first derivatives) of these indices were used to train univariate Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, with Mc, RBNI, and NGWI achieving the highest predictive performance (RMSE ≈ 10.2 days). Three indices were then combined in a multivariate LSTM model, which significantly improved prediction accuracy, achieving an RMSE of 8.18 days and demonstrating robust alignment with observed harvest dates. The findings underscore the value of combining SAR and optical data for modeling complex phenological events and highlight the potential of scalable deep learning frameworks in advancing precision agriculture. Future work will expand this methodology across Western Canada and incorporate real-time weather and soil data to further enhance prediction generalizability."

Ecuador currently faces an electricity deficit of 1,000 MW, which could be reduced by installing residential photovoltaic (PV) systems ranging from 1 kWp to 4 kWp. However, limited government incentives mean that homeowners show little interest in PV systems, delaying their future deployment. This work comprehensively analyzes the residential PV deployments according to grid parity and payback periods. To this end, we analyze the case study of Ecuador, evaluating the profitability of distributed PV systems according to user consumption and the electric tariff. Several PV system simulations were performed using empirical data collected in Quito, Ecuador. In addition, we propose a financial model based on Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Scenario analysis indicates that grid parity is achievable when incentives are offered or discount rates are increased, making distributed residential PV more attractive. Empirical results show that the most favorable scenario reduces the time to achieve network parity by up to nine years."

    "abstract": "In remote sensing areas, multispectral unmixing (MU) becomes critical as typical multispectral images (MSIs) inevitably suffer from the mixed pixel phenomenon due to the limited spatial resolution. However, MU mathematically corresponds to a challenging underdetermined problem (i.e., less spectral bands than sources), hampering the researchers from tackling it. Current MU methodologies often overlook the underdetermined problem and are simply extended from the hyperspectral unmixing (HU) without theoretical breakthroughs. In this study, we propose a deep light-splitting system (DLS) to address the underdetermined nature of MU wherein the network within the DLS incorporates a specific advanced quantum deep network (QUEEN) serving as the quantum prism. Remarkably, the proposed DLS is virtual, which means the obtained hyperspectral images (HSIs) hold fundamental properties (e.g., non-negativity and geometry structure) but do not need to correspond to any physical sensor, allowing us to easily determine the spectral response as a deterministic matrix. In light of these, we can effectively unmix the spectra through the convex geometry, followed by downsampling the hyperspectral sources back to the multispectral ones. The proposed quantum prism-inspired MU (Q-MU) algorithm successfully recovers 6 spectra sources from 4-band MSIs."

    "abstract": "Forest height is one of the most important forest parameters for quantifying forest carbon stocks. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the characteristics of strong penetration and wide coverage, and has great potential in estimating forest height. Recently, China launched a new L-band differential interferometric SAR mission, named Lutan-1. To evaluate the potential of Lutan-1 on estimating forest height, we selected two commonly used SAR information, i.e. backscatter coefficient and interferometric coherence, from Lutan-1 for analysis, and compared it with other satellites. We found that the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> between the backscatter coefficient in HH polarization of Lutan-1 and forest height reached 0.44, which is better than the performance of Sentinel-1 (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=0.43 for VH) and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=0.18 for HH).

    "abstract": "In hybrid distribution transformer (HDT), the series power electronic module (PEM) compensates voltage disturbances to protect sensitive loads connected to the distribution grid. The magnitude of the injected voltage depends on the severity of the voltage disturbance in the grid. The DC-link voltage is set based on the maximum voltage injection scenario and is kept constant across all voltage disturbance conditions. Since the switching losses of a PEM are directly dependent on the DC-link voltage, it can therefore be reduced by maintaining DC-link voltage at lower levels during instances of low voltage disturbance. Therefore, by dynamically adjusting the DC-link voltage based on the required injected voltage magnitude, switching losses can be minimized and overall conversion efficiency can be improved. This paper proposes a variable DC-link voltage control strategy for a back-to-back (B2B) PEM in HDT to enhance conversion efficiency. The proposed control method is verified using MATLAB/Simulink on an 11/0.4 kV distribution network with a 5% voltage sag. The efficiency of a two-level voltage source inverter (VSI) is assessed as an example, and results demonstrate that a lower DC-link voltage yields higher efficiency across the full load range."

In space surveillance, where rapid object detection, accurate trajectory prediction, and real-time decision-making are paramount, these sensors provide an unparalleled advantage. In this paper, we propose an optimized ConvLSTM architecture, a novel integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, tailored specifically to analyze the sparse and asynchronous nature of event-based data streams. By combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the temporal sequence modeling strengths of LSTMs, our model captures the spatiotemporal dependencies essential for high-performance space surveillance. The architecture is meticulously fine-tuned with innovations such as dynamic pooling, an optimized learning rate schedule, and a robust event-based data preprocessing pipeline, ensuring robust performance across critical tasks. Experimental evaluations highlight the model’s exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.7%, along with Mean Squared Error (MSE) values of 0.0034 for velocity estimation and 0.0027 for trajectory prediction, surpassing traditional methods. These results underscore the potential of ConvLSTM in advancing space surveillance systems, offering robust capabilities for dynamic space environments."

This dataset has the potential to extend our understanding of the subsurface evolution of that ice sheet by nearly two decades compared to the next oldest radargram data. However, large uncertainties remain in the location of these data ranging between 5.5 to 7 kilometers.

Furthermore, multi-band PolSAR data with its distinct penetrability is widely used in the field of agricultural monitoring. Among them, compared with spaceborne PolSAR, airborne PolSAR can obtain more timely ground information by virtue of its mobility. However, how to perform airborne multi-band PolSAR registration quickly and efficiently has been a difficult problem not yet resolved, due to the differences in resolution and scattering centers, especially in the coherent/covariance matrix level. The paper proposes a polarimetric SAR feature registration method based on Regularized Histogram Equalization–Discrete Cosine Transform (RHE-DCT) and edge enhancement, building upon the SAR-SIFT approach. The experiments employ airborne PolSAR data obtained by Aerial Remote Sensing System Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang Province and Wanning in Hainan Province. Compared with the traditional SAR-SIFT method, the proposed approach significantly reduces registration time in both standard registration scenarios and distorted image registration, while also achieving notable performance improvements."

Despite its potential, harmonizing soil spectral data remains a critical challenge due to inconsistencies arising from diverse instrumentation, protocols, and environmental conditions. To address this, the IEEE SA P4005 \"Standards and Protocols for Soil Spectroscopy\" initiative developed standardized protocols for laboratory and field soil spectral measurements, aimed at ensuring data reliability, reproducibility, and interoperability. This work presents a validation exercise of the P4005 protocol; measurements were performed using six spectrometers operated by independent groups on diverse targets, including soil, sand, stone, fabric, and wood. The exercise evaluated the harmonization efficacy of Internal Soil Standards with each spectrometer’s Contact Probe setups, and the SoilPro® apparatus for field conditions. Results demonstrated significant reductions in measurement variability through ISS corrections, with the CP setup achieving up to 49% improvement in standard deviation for soil reflectance, underscoring the potential of P4005 protocols and ISS-based harmonization to unify soil spectral datasets provided by different laboratories or user groups, and to reduce measurement uncertainty."

Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined using second-order spatio-spectral differences, is a widely used regularization approach that effectively captures the spatio-spectral piecewise smoothness specific to HS images, enabling robust noise removal. However, SSTV uniformly computes adjacent differences in spatial and spectral dimensions, leading to the corruption of complex spatial structures and abrupt spectral variations in HS images. To address these limitations, we incorporate spatial and spectral graphs that explicitly reflect the spatial and spectral structures into the regularization model. Furthermore, we design a framework to construct these graphs from the noisy HS image. In addition, we formulate the mixed noise removal problem as a convex optimization problem involving GASSTV and develop an efficient algorithm based on the preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve it. Experimental results on mixed noise removal demonstrate the superior performance of GASSTV compared with existing HS image regularization models."

    "abstract": "The exponentially weighted averages (ROEWA) operator can resist the multiplicative speckle noise interference, which is widely used in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image registration to obtain consistent gradients. However, abrupt dark patches in the SAR image cause the horizontal and vertical gradients obtained based on the ROEWA operator to increase dramatically. Thus, the gradient magnitudes at the edges of the dark patches are significantly different from those of the other pixel points. The degree of consistency between the gradients of these two types of images is reduced by this phenomenon, which ultimately affects the accuracy of image registration. Therefore, a ROEWA operator based on weighted ratios (WR-ROEWA) is proposed in this paper. The magnitude extremes are avoided in localized areas by limiting the range of gradient values in the horizontal and vertical directions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for improving gradient consistency is verified by image registration experiments based on real data."

    "abstract": "The flat structural design of axial flux PM motors (AFPMM) allows for higher torque densities, which are gradually paid attention in aerospace applications. Most aeroelectric propulsion motors take advantage of the working environment to adopt forced air-cooled heat dissipation. The air-cooled heat dissipation efficiency of AFPMM with double rotor-single stator structure is low due to the small heat dissipation contact surface between the stator and the housing. Direct liquid cooling systems are more efficient at dissipating heat, but they require the introduction of a liquid circulation system, which occupies and consumes additional space and energy. Based on this, this paper designs a heat sink that can be integrated into the end of the motor, the aim is to simplify the liquid circulation system of the motor while retaining its liquid cooling efficiency. This radiator uses external wind energy to cool hot liquids, saving space and improving energy efficiency. In the article, the influence of different factors on the heat dissipation efficiency of the heat sink is investigated through theoretical analysis, and a three-dimensional CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) fluid-solid coupling model is constructed for multi-physics field simulation verification. The results show that the radiator system can simultaneously meet the requirements of heat dissipation and light weight."

To mitigate this, we systematically evaluate geometric, noise, and brightness/contrast operations using a multispectral coastal segmentation dataset. Through statistical tests, we identify geometric augmentations as the most effective. They produced a model that surpasses the baseline trained on 30,000 rough annotations using only 100 manually labelled examples. Furthermore, we found fine-tuning the baseline with augmentations significantly enhances its performance.

The coordination time between the primary relay and the backup relay is referred to as the time coordination interval (CTI). CTI can be interpreted as the difference in operating time of the primary and secondary relays. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a heuristic method developed based on the principles of genetics and the natural selection process of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. This algorithm is used to obtain the optimal coordination time value. Relay coordination is carried out based on the limitations derived from the CTI and CTI’ values for critical fault locations. Based on the explanation above, a study was conducted to determine the performance of distance relay coordination and overcurrent relay (OCR) in the Sekarputih Substance to the Mojoagung Substance. This study presents a combination of distance relay coordination with OCR to have the shortest possible fault isolation time. Furthermore, the analysis is based on the IEEE C37.113-2015 standard, IEEE Guide for Protective Relay Applications on Transmission Lines, and the characteristics of the OCR relay are Normally Inverse (NI). Genetic algorithms are used to obtain the optimal values of the multiplier time setting (TMS), plug setting (PS), and second zone operating time (TZ2).

Missions such as Sentinel-2, Landsat, MERIS, and MODIS have established methodological foundations for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) using multispectral sensors. However, multispectral sensors are designed to capture generalized spectral information across a limited number of broad wavelength bands, which can be insufficient for distinguishing the subtle and complex spectral variations found in waters with diverse optical properties, commonly known as complex waters. The ability to characterize these subtle spectral variations is crucial to addressing one of the greatest challenges in this field: developing models capable of generalizing predictions in complex waters, such as type I and type II. This study presents a methodological framework for calibrating models capable of addressing such complexity. The methodology uses hyperspectral data obtained via spectroradiometers, which are simulated to replicate the spectral response of the PRISMA sensor. Subsequently, the optical water types (OWTs) are classified, and through spectral sensitivity analysis, specific indices are identified for Chl-a prediction. These indices are used to calibrate regression models based on machine learning. Among the evaluated models, Random Forest showed the best performance, with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.69, followed by XGBoost (0.62) and Support Vector Machine (0.53).

However, the changing climate has severely affected both glacier stability and seasonal snowfall patterns, leading to flash floods and uncertain water supplies for irrigation and domestic use. This paper reports a community-led indigenous development, deployment, and maintenance of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled hydrometeorological monitoring network spanning seven snowfall seasons (2018-2025) in a small catchment located in the Kabul River sub-basin of the Indus. Validated by companion studies using InDSAR interferometry, the snow level measurements provide insights into the extent, timing, and melt rates of seasonal snowfall patterns. The data from remote and inaccessible areas can be used by the agricultural department to forecast water availability in the summer and issue advisories to farmers for crop selection. Yearly variations, such as early or late winter snowfall, are clearly evident from the sensor data collected, and they can impact flash floods and agricultural water availability in the summer. Stream flow measurements at the drainage point of the catchment provide a glimpse into the contributions of the Kabul River to the Indus and also capture rainfall events outside the winter season with great importance to the community’s flood awareness during the annual Monsoons. Finally, we capture the logistical challenges in maintaining the network, the opportunities in scaling up this network to other catchments of the region and the most recent efforts to incorporate direct measurements of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) using indigenously designed snow pillows."

    "abstract": "Road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images has become a critical task in various applications. Accurate road extraction is essential for generating up-to-date maps,supporting autonomous vehicles, and enabling efficient disaster response. However, challenges such as road occlusions, shadows, and surface similarities make precise extraction of road segments a difficult task. These issues are particularly pronounced in urban areas with dense infrastructure or in rural regions with sparse road networks. To address these challenges,this paper proposes a method called GDNet, which integrates graph convolution network(GCN) and hybrid dilated convolution(HDC). The HDC module enhances the receptive field, improving the completeness of road predictions. This allows the model to capture both large-scale road structures and smaller, intricate details critical for accurate extraction. The GCN module establishes long-range dependencies, enhancing the connectivity of road predictions in complex environments. By modeling pixel relationships as a graph,GCN connects fragmented road segments, improving overall prediction accuracy. Additionally,the dual attention mechanism(DAM) module is applied at the skip connections to strengthen the linear features of the predicted roads.Experimental results demonstrate that GDNet outperforms existing methods, particularly in predicting roads obscured by occlusions or shadows. Moreover, GDNet’s robustness is evident in its ability to handle a wide range of environmental conditions, making it effective across diverse real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Analyzing teacher behavior from lengthy classroom recordings presents significant computational challenges. Traditional video analysis methods often rely on fixed-rate frame sampling, such as processing every k-th frame. This approach can lead to redundant processing during periods of low activity, like lectures, and may result in the loss of crucial information during periods of rapid behavioral changes, such as transitions between teaching modalities. This inefficiency hinders the practical application of automated behavior analysis systems in educational settings. This paper introduces an Adaptive Frame Sampling (AFS) technique specifically designed for efficient and accurate teacher behavior analysis. Our approach dynamically adjusts the video frame sampling rate based on scene complexity and the rate of behavioral change. Key innovations include: (1) Dynamic Sampling Rate Control, which intelligently increases sampling intervals during stable behavior periods and decreases them during transitions or complex interactions, significantly reducing computational load. (2) Behavior Boundary Precision Enhancement, employing change trend detection and targeted backtrack sampling to accurately pinpoint the timing of behavioral shifts. (3) Resource Efficiency Optimization, demonstrably reducing processing time by 40-60% compared to fixed-rate sampling while maintaining or even improving the accuracy of behavior detection and boundary localization. We implement and evaluate this technique using a configurable analysis pipeline, orchestrated by scripts like 'run_adaptive.sh’, allowing flexible parameter tuning (e.g., initial, minimum, maximum skip rates). Experiments on relevant educational video datasets show substantial improvements in processing efficiency and the ability to capture fine-grained behavioral dynamics, making large-scale automated analysis of teaching practices more feasible."

    "abstract": "Many researchers have investigated DETR-based detectors for remote sensing images due to their promising performance. However, most of these studies focus solely on fine-grained categories, although existing remote sensing datasets typically organize these categories into a hierarchical label structure by adding ancestors to them at coarser-grained levels. Therefore, each object is equipped with hierarchical labels from the root node to the leaf node. In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve DETR-based detectors by modeling the semantic relationships among hierarchical labels into the learning of object queries and hierarchical classification. Specifically, since the object queries in DETR-based detectors represent candidate proposals in the image, hierarchical contrastive learning is introduced to perform clustering on them at each hierarchical level during training, based on the hierarchical labels assigned to them after the bipartite matching. Moreover, in contrast to fine-grained classification in conventional detectors, we encode hierarchical labels into the classification outputs to indicate multi-granularity category assignments to each object. Experiments are conducted on a hierarchically structured dataset, ShipRSImageNet, and our proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by 1.13 mAP, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our work."

To rapidly obtain remote sensing images with both high spatial and high spectral resolution, unsupervised deep learning methods for fusing HSI and multispectral images (MSI) have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing studies often overlook the issue of high-frequency information loss in the fused images. To address this limitation, we propose a Prior-based three-stage unsupervised Invertible neural Fuse Network (PIFNet). Specifically, the framework consists of three key modules: prior information extraction, spectral channel mapping, and detail feature fuse. In particular, the detail feature fuse module leverages an invertible neural network to prevent information loss through mutual generation of input and output features. Experimental results on simulated datasets demonstrate that the PIFNet outperforms existing unsupervised deep learning methods, highlighting its potential and effectiveness in HSI-MSI fusion tasks."

According to the WER and CER metrics, Transformerbased OCR (Tr-OCR) achieves the lowest error rate, achieving 0,63 WER and 0.63 CER on the modified IAM Handwriting dataset, while 1,92 WER and 3,05 CER on the UM-PTI-Handwriting dataset. In terms of the processing time, Tesseract OCR is the fastest, while Transformer-based OCR (Donut) is the slowest. It concluded that the Transformer OCR (Tr-OCR) excels in recognizing English handwritten. However, all compared OCRs have lower accuracy in Indonesian handwritten text compared to English handwritten text."

    "abstract": "The paper describes a systematic approach for the automatic introduction of data redundancy in a safety-critical application. The transformations aim to make the program capable of detecting potential soft errors caused by transient faults that may alter the program's data. The approach is based on an automated system that leverages the polymorphism features offered by the Rust programming language. Rust is focused on speed, safety, and concurrency, and it also provides powerful high-level abstractions at zero cost. The paper proposes a technique for hardening source code by creating redundant code through an automatic data redundancy system, achieved by defining a trait that enables data duplication and the detection of potential errors. The use of a trait allows the compiler to generate optimized code, without introducing abstraction-related overhead and with minimal programmer effort for boilerplate code generation. Preliminary experimental results are presented, showing the fault coverage achieved by the method, as well as some data related to the performance overhead and the increase in code size."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the issue of illegal unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) positioning has attracted widespread attention. This paper focuses on the positioning system based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA) in critical areas. In light of the potential positioning blind spots that may arise from regular station deployment strategies, the secretary bird optimization algorithm (SBOA) is introduced to optimize the station layout in key areas. The average value of the root mean square error (RMSE) of positioning is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to regular deployments. On this basis, this paper also studies the high-precision solution method for the TDOA positioning problem. By integrating the fast optimization speed of the gradient descent (GD) with the global-searching characteristic of the search method, a gradient-based search (GBS) method is proposed for optimizing the target position. Experimental results demonstrate that GBS achieves 255 m lower RMSE than GD under 99 ns TDOA errors, and the convergence speed is faster."

Different from traditional methods, this algorithm can solve both on-grid and off-grid problems while realizing high precision parameter estimation. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, a fast algorithm of the atomic norm minimization-alternating direction method of multipliers (ANM-ADMM) is proposed.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral images (HSI) exhibit complex contextual relationships and spectral variations, which pose significant challenges in capturing local high-frequency and global low-frequency information during feature learning. Integrating the strengths of convolution to balance high and low frequencies with Vision Transformers (ViT) yields impressive results. However, an excessive focus on irrelevant key-value tokens in queries can lead to inaccurate global contextual perception. Thus, we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Convolution mixer (ASpaCT) for HSI classification. It incorporates Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence into the query-key attention map, guiding the query to concentrate on only a few key tokens. Additionally, we introduce the neighbor-hood information entropy for contextual sparsity estimation, which adaptively determines the sparsity hyperparameter in the KL regularizer. In homogeneous areas, a low-sparsity constraint promotes the query’s connection to more contextual key tokens, whereas in non-homogeneous regions, the contrary holds. Our experiments demonstrate that ASpaCT significantly enhances HSI classification, outperforming both benchmark models and several state-of-the-art approaches."

Considering the different influences of each dimension on slant range, this approach simplifies the three-dimensional (3D) motion trajectory errors of SAR into one dimension. By approximating the trajectory in this manner, the method integrated with the BP algorithm improves the quality of image focusing. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Earth Observation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides consistent high-resolution imaging. However, current sensors face challenges in monitoring extensive regions in real time. This paper introduces a novel concept called ADaptive OBserving SAR (ADOB-SAR), which integrates intelligence on the sensor itself to perform selective data acquisition. It utilizes concurrent and reconfigurable imaging modes to adapt the acquisition to the scene properties and application requirements on the fly. The idea is that the sensor analyzes the scene ahead, extracting coarse information sufficient to identify key areas or objects of interest. Then, it autonomously generates the parameters of new acquisitions adapted to the extracted scene properties and optimized to maximize the acquired information while managing resources. The system performance, such as spatial resolution and energy, is controlled based on a dynamic optimization model that changes with the scenario. This concept significantly reduces stored and transferred data volume, as only the relevant information is kept."

The primary advantage of the proposed approach is the relative independence of the optimal turn-on time on the frequency and peak voltage of the harvester output. Thus, the proposed RTOT-MPPT method reduces the complexity of power tracking and can be efficient for a wider range of harvesters. The method is implemented for a triboelectric harvester and simulated in a 180 n m industrial HV-CMOS process, demonstrating that 34% higher power is delivered to the rectifier in each cycle."

Our method transforms heart sound signals into high-dimensional hypervectors by extracting key audio features, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), spectral contrast, and chroma features, followed by quantization and encoding into highdimensional space. The resulting hypervectors are then classified using multi-centroid class representations, generated via k-means clustering, and evaluated through cosine similarity. Our approach achieves rapid inference, robust noise tolerance, and lower computational complexity compared to traditional machine learning methods. The hybrid feature encoding technique effectively captures both spectral and temporal characteristics of PCG signals, enhancing classification accuracy and consistency. We evaluate our model's performance using confusion matrices, inference time analysis, and energy efficiency estimation on a 3W TinyML embedded device. Our refined classifier demonstrates an overall accuracy of 83%, with an average inference time of 1.15 ms per sample, and energy consumption as low as 0.0035 Joules per classification. These results emphasize the potential of our HDC-based approach for reliable, real-time, and low-power diagnostic applications in embedded and wearable biomedical devices."

Most existing FSS methods primarily rely on the similarity between support-query pixel pairs to establish pixel-level semantic correlations. However, in remote sensing scenarios characterized by significant intra-class variation and complex backgrounds, pixel-level correlations can introduce substantial matching biases, leading to semantic ambiguity between foreground (FG) and background (BG) pixels in the query image. To address this challenge, we propose a discriminative prototype-guided feature matching network, consisting of a prototype correction module and a cross-matching module. The network is designed to extract the most discriminative pseudo-prototypes of query foregrounds, with the aim of optimizing pixel-level matching between the query and support features. Experimental results on the iSAID-5i dataset demonstrate that the proposed feature matching network achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Cross-domain models have been successfully applied to polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification tasks to address the issue of scarce labeled samples. However, due to the complexity of polarized data and severe cross-domain shifts, these models face challenges in extracting robust domain-invariant features. Additionally, because target domain data are involved in the training of cross-domain models, it makes these models difficult to adapt to real-world application scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a target decomposition feature-guided multimodal domain generalization network (TDDGN) for unsupervised cross-domain PolSAR image classification. Firstly, an image feature extraction module is constructed to extract the modal features of depth images. At the same time, considering that the representative target decomposition features of the same class in the same frequency band have cross-domain consistency, the six-component scattering power decomposition (6SD) method and the kuhn-munkres (KM) algorithm are used to obtain the domain common target decomposition features, and the text encoder transforms them into text modal features. Then, the two modal features are embedded into the unified feature space, but due to the large semantic distribution difference of the multimodal features, a shared knowledge transfer module based on pattern memory is designed, and the multi-modal alignment is achieved in the local in-class and global feature space by combining contrast learning and adversarial learning, so as to guide the image modal feature optimization through the text modes with domain consistency. Therefore, clear class distribution and cross-domain invariant image modal characteristics are obtained for target domain classification. The classification results prove the superiority of text feature-guided image feature strategy in unsupervised PolSAR image classification."

    "abstract": "Open radio access networks (ORANs), characterized by their emphasis on the disaggregation of hardware and software components of radio access networks (RANs) and the utilization of open standards, present fertile ground for flexibility and innovations. However, they also introduce complexities in managing bandwidth, user equipment (UE) power allocations, power consumption (PC), and virtualization. To maximize energy efficiency (EE), PC must be effectively managed, and transmitted power and bandwidth to UEs must be optimized. The task in ORANs is more complex due to new components, designs, and protocols. This paper is concerned with maximizing EE in the context of ORANs. The primary focus lies in the realm of virtual machines (VMs) allocation within a multi-tiered cloud infrastructure. To achieve such optimization, a thorough PC model is developed, incorporating various network parameters, including the number of resource blocks (RBs), the number of connected UEs of each VM, the total number of UEs, the initial and maximum power of the server, the number of VMs, the transmitted power, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and bandwidth. This work also optimizes the EE through resource allocation models, focusing on open interfaces such as enhanced common public radio interface (eCPRI) and 7.2x fronthaul. It also explores virtualization and network protocols’ role in managing channel capacity and latency, highlighting the trade-off between throughput and protocol overhead. A complex optimization methodology, namely the Lagrange multiplier has been used along with three numerical algorithms: sequential quadratic programming (SQP), active set, and interior point to solve the objective of maximizing EE. The outcomes of this research show the influence of network parameters on PC and EE under some constraints, including the number of UEs, the number of VMs, the number of RBs, and channel capacity. The problem has been recognized as a non-linear problem characterized by inequality restrictions with mixed convexity and concavity behavior. However, different convergence criteria can impact the EE, as more stringent convergence criteria may result in less accurate solutions, and vice versa. For the three algorithms, the interior point and SQP algorithms outperform the active set in most of the cases. Under optimized configurations, SQP enhanced EE by approximately 15% compared to traditional architecture. In addition, 50% increment in the number of UEs, concurrent with 50% less VMs’ allocation when using SQP were achieved compared with interior point. Finally, 15% decrease in latency was accomplished when using interior point compared to SQP."

    "abstract": "This work analyzes and models degradation in 18650 lithium-ion cells using segmented experimental charge–discharge data (99 cycles under two cycling profiles, 3C/1C and 2C/2C). Beyond raw electrical and thermal measurements (voltage, current, and temperature), we derive operational indicators—mainly cycle time (charge/discharge duration) and internal impedance—to capture nonlinear relationships with capacity. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with multiple kernels (RBF, Rational Quadratic, Matérn, plus white noise) is used to predict capacity from these features. Quantitative results indicate that cycle-time features are the most predictive variables. During charging, the top configurations achieve RMSE values of 2.217–4.606 mAh and MAE values of 1.411–3.290 mAh across two cells. During discharge, the best models reach RMSE values of 3.166–3.518 mAh and MAE of 2.186–2.192 mAh. In contrast, impedance-only settings produce significantly higher errors — RMSE approximately 138–182 mAh during charging and roughly 11.281–11.683 mAh during discharging (MAE approximately 9.159–9.416 mAh) — demonstrating their limited usefulness when used alone under the studied regimes. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed GPR plus operational features methodology and show that feature selection has a greater impact on accuracy than kernel choice. The approach delivers low absolute error, stable predictive distributions, and consistent phase performance, supporting SOH/RUL estimation and second-life cell screening. The cycle segmentation based on fragmentation further improves interpretability and model design, offering a practical route toward reliable battery management and sustainable second-life applications."

This study integrates electroencephalography (EEG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) in VR environments to improve emotion recognition in dynamic, high-stress situations that are difficult to replicate in real-world settings. The experiment involved a simulated elevator sabotage scenario, during which participants’ neurophysiological and physiological responses were recorded as the elevator descended.

    "abstract": "To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novelWiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish a two-timescale framework for the joint optimization for the content placement and content delivery problem in satellite-terrestrial edge computing networks (STECN). Our goal is to optimize content placement to improve network performance while ensuring diverse quality of service (QoS) for content delivery. We decouple the problem into two timescales to balance real-time responsiveness and long-term efficiency. Specifically, considering frequent content placement incurs huge traffic cost, we optimize the content placement in order to reduce resource expenses in large timescales. The optimization problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to improve both traffic efficiency and cache resource utilization. We leverage a heuristic atom search optimization (ASO) approach to address the problem, which yields an optimal strategy with low computational complexity. In small timescales, we model content delivery as a Markov decision process (MDP) to minimize content delivery delays at small timescales while maintaining smooth network traffic. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is used for policy learning to dynamically adapt to varying network conditions. By considering the correlation between the small and large timescale optimization, we propose a hierarchical solution to jointly address both issues. Finally, extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous multicore computing architectures have fundamentally transformed the computational potential of modern mobile devices by enabling parallel and energy-aware task execution. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques further allow mobile devices to adjust their operating frequency based on their workload demands to save energy. Additionally, edge computing offers the potential to offload intensive tasks, further enhancing energy efficiency. However, the highly dynamic and unpredictable conditions of mobile environments complicate the effective use of these advancements. To address this challenge and alleviate the burden of short battery life, we focus on enhancing energy efficiency in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an intelligent DVFS-based algorithm that distinguishes itself from existing literature by jointly optimizing task scheduling, frequency scaling, offloading, and power allocation through learned policies. To do so, we first formulate an optimization problem that aims to minimize the energy while meeting task deadlines. This problem is a highly complex combinatorial optimization, and we prove its NP-hardness. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of mobile environments further complicates achieving an optimal solution. To address these challenges and adapt to unpredictable changes, we then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm, called iDEAS, which gradually learns the best policy of decision making. We introduce a cost function for different action choices, using which we derive a reward function for the DRL agent. We further evaluate the performance of iDEAS on two distinct task sets and compare it with two state-of-the-art existing works, one prioritizing energy efficiency and the other compromising energy consumption for fewer task drops. The results show that iDEAS reduces energy consumption by 69% and 75% for less computationally intensive tasks, and by 54% and 72% for more demanding tasks, compared to these methods. Notably, iDEAS achieves these energy savings while reducing task drops by 18% for intensive workloads and almost eliminating task drops for lighter workloads."

    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have been recently proposed to improve the performance of wireless networks by reconfiguring both the large-scale and small-scale channel conditions. However, existing studies ignore the physical constraints of antenna placement and assume fixed antenna radiation power. To overcome this limitation, this paper investigates the design of PASS, taking into account the motion power consumption of pinching antennas (PAs) and the impact of adjustable antenna radiation power. To that end, we minimize the average power consumption for a given quality-of-service (QoS) requirement by jointly optimizing the antenna positions, antenna radiation power ratios, and transmit beamforming. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to consider radiation power optimization in PASS, which provides an additional degree of freedom (DoF) for system design. The cases with both continuous and discrete antenna placement are considered, where the main challenge lies in the fact that the antenna positions affect both the magnitude and phase of the channel coefficients of PASS, making system optimization very challenging. To tackle the resulting unique obstacles, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based framework is proposed to solve the problem for continuous antenna movement, while its discrete counterpart is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Simulation results validate the performance enhancement achieved by incorporating PA movement power consumption and adjustable radiation power into the PASS design, while also demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed optimization framework. The benefits of PASS over conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in mitigating the large-scale path loss and inter-user interference are also revealed."

    "abstract": "Low Altitude Network (LAN) has emerged as a critical infrastructure for applications such as surveillance and emergency response. Group communication for LAN offers enhanced energy efficiency and reduced network overhead. However, existing group communication protocols encounter difficulties in managing the rekeying process efficiently for a dynamic group or require computationally expensive public key primitives for shared secret handshaking to overcome this challenge. Moreover, the security of most of the existing protocols relies primarily on the safekeeping of some secrets on the group members' devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel physical unclonable function (PUF)-based lightweight secure group communication protocol. The proposed protocol utilizes a combination of the device's PUF and the one-time pad (OTP) to eliminate secure key storage at both group verifier and prover nodes, and achieves perfect forward secrecy (PFS) by eliminating dependence on static long-term secrets. The proposed protocol also supports efficient group key renewal by using a full binary tree as a secret vault for sharing and updating distributed secrets with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Meantime, this data structure also reduces the computation and communication complexity for key renewal to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(\\log _{2}N)$</tex-math></inline-formula> at the cluster head and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(1)$</tex-math></inline-formula> at the sensor nodes.

The proposed protocol was also validated by formal security analyses and a physical LAN implementation using Ultra96-V2 boards as cluster nodes."

    "abstract": "The bogie of a high-speed train is a key component connecting the car body and the track, operating under complex high-stress mechanical conditions. Traditional methods for bogie condition monitoring rely on independent units such as eddy current sensors and resistance strain gauges. While these methods have been widely used in early-stage monitoring, they gradually reveal issues such as complex wiring, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and poor environmental adaptability under the complex working conditions of high-speed trains. This paper proposes a new type of sensor using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) series configuration, which boasts advantages including miniaturization, electromagnetic interference resistance, excellent electrical insulation, operational safety, high sensitivity, light weight, stable chemical properties, and low cost, enabling simultaneous measurement of vibration, temperature, and strain. The working principle and structure of the integrated sensor were systematically studied. Sensitivity characteristics and natural frequency parameters were theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified through a dedicated test scheme. A separate calibration procedure was implemented for each measurement parameter to ensure measurement fidelity. A comprehensive multi-parameter sensing system integrating vibration-temperature-strain monitoring functions was established for performance evaluation. Field validation experiments conducted on a high-speed train bogie test platform showed that, when benchmarked against traditional reference sensors, the proposed FBG integrated sensor achieved a 62% enhancement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) through amplitude domain analysis. The developed sensing system exhibits effective diagnostic capability for faults in key components of high-speed train bogies, thus providing a robust solution for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of railway transportation infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Graph querying is the process of retrieving information from graph data using specialized languages (e.g., Cypher), often requiring programming expertise. Visual Graph Querying (VGQ) streamlines this process by enabling users to construct and execute queries via an interactive interface without resorting to complex coding. However, current VGQ tools only allow users to construct simple and specifc query graphs, limiting users' ability to interactively express their query intent, especially for underspecifed query intent. To address these limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying system to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by supporting intuitive graph structure construction and fexible parameterized rule specifcation. Specifcally, Envisage comprises four stages: Query Expression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through intuitive operations; Query Verifcation enables the validation of constructed queries via rule verifcation and query instantiation; Progressive Query Execution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying results; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation. To evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 graph analysts. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in constructing, verifying, and executing complex graph queries."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework to develop optimal intermittent pursuit strategies against stochastic, noncooperative space targets under discontinuous observation conditions. Traditional pursuit-evasion models, such as those grounded in differential games, typically rely on continuous observation and control—assumptions that are often invalid in practical space missions due to limited visibility windows and intermittent tracking. These limitations reduce the applicability of classical approaches in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we formulate a pursuit-evasion model that explicitly incorporates both discontinuous observations and intermittent control across four representative scenarios. Building on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we propose an enhanced method—Intermittent Observation and Control DDPG (IOC-DDPG)—designed to learn robust pursuit policies under realistic constraints. We validate the proposed approach in a noncooperative spacecraft rendezvous case study involving stochastic target maneuvers. Simulation results show that IOC-DDPG consistently achieves a success rate exceeding 70%, outperforming traditional methods across diverse and challenging mission conditions. These results highlight the practical potential of deep reinforcement learning in addressing real-world space mission constraints, and pave the way for future extensions to multi-agent pursuit-evasion scenarios and partially observable environments."

Applying the method of moments (MoM) with the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG)-like element on an appropriately structured mesh to these arrays results in an impedance matrix where the main part exhibits a multilevel block Toeplitz structure. This article introduces a memory-efficient construction method that effectively represents and reuses impedance calculations. The proposed method, applicable to electrically connected elements, also accounts for all non-symmetric parts of the array. The core idea involves nine distinct electrically connectable components from which the array can be assembled. The derived multilevel block Toeplitz matrix is further utilized by an in-house inverse solver to achieve faster and more memory-efficient MoM current vector calculations. We demonstrate the method by computing the far-field of a 32x32 array and the scattering parameters of two tightly coupled 9x9 arrays.

    "abstract": "As robots integrate into human society, ensuring safe robot-environment interaction, particularly in the event of collisions, has emerged as a growing design priority. A promising solution is introducing proper compliance into existing rigid robots, akin to musculoskeletal systems, to absorb impacts in various directions. However, mimicking longitudinal compliance seen in biological joints to absorb compressive impacts along limbs, such as the role of cartilages like menisci, remains a challenge shadowed by the complexity of joint architecture. Here, exploring and adapting the elastic longitudinal movement structure of knee, we incorporated traditional mechanical hinges with a compact buffer structure to enable both simple rotational motion and effective longitudinal impact absorption. Under longitudinal loading, the buffer structure functions as a mechanism transmitting the limited compression to amplified deformations of elastic elements, thus producing resistance against load. The resistive load-displacement relationship is tailorable by tuning diverse elastic components, allowing for a high-static-low-dynamic stiffness to improve energy absorption efficiency. Drop tests and walking robot demonstrations confirm that the proposed knee-inspired hinge not only mitigates acceleration transmitted to the robot's main body but also reduces ground reaction forces, thereby improving robot-environment interaction safety. This work highlights the design paradigm of adapting natural solutions to mechanical systems, and holds potential for direct integration into diverse robots, exoskeletons, and prostheses."

To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-directional SSM for HSI reconstruction, which aims to recover the corresponding HSI from a given RGB image. Specifically, the proposed method adopts a selective scan mechanism in four spatial directions to effectively model the image information flow, overcoming the limitation of unidirectional modeling of the SSM.

Hyperspectral images were collected at three growth stages during an experimental field trial conducted in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Concurrently, leaf tissue samples were gathered from seven nitrogen treatment levels, each replicated four times, to serve as ground truth data. Several machine learning (ML) models were developed and evaluated to predict plant N-uptake. The results demonstrated that hyperspectral imaging could estimate N content with high accuracy. For canola, the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.51 to 0.65, with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values between 0.73 and 0.84.

However, the magnetic cross coupling between the two three-phase systems impacts the output current harmonics and subsequently the torque ripple which is further exacerbated by interleaving of their respective carriers. The impact of magnetic coupling on the DC-link and output current ripples is investigated."

However, integrating systems that utilize PLCs from different vendors, such as Siemens and Schneider Electric, continues to face interoperability challenges due to differences in communication protocols and data structures. This study aims to design and implement an IoT-based monitoring system using Node-RED capable of integrating two PLCs from different vendors-Siemens S7-1200 and Schneider Modicon TM221. The research employs an experimental prototyping method involving two industrial plants: a water tank filling system controlled by a Schneider PLC and an automated sorting system simulated using Factory I/O and controlled by a Siemens PLC. Both systems are interconnected via a Modbus TCP/IP network and monitored in real time through a web-based Node-RED dashboard. The test results indicate that the system is capable of transmitting data in real time with minimal delay, ranging from 10 to 20 milliseconds, in compliance with ISA-95 standards for industrial vertical communication. Moreover, connection stability tests reveal that Node-RED can automatically reconnect during network disruptions, with recovery times ranging from 3 to 20 seconds depending on the type of disturbance. This study demonstrates that a Node-RED-based cross-vendor PLC integration can serve as an efficient and adaptive solution for industrial monitoring systems in the digitalization era."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in electric vehicles and renewable energy integration, along with lithium scarcity, underscores the need for alternative battery technologies, with sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising candidate. Significant effort is being directed towards developing sodium-ion technology to meet future energy storage needs. A key challenge for its practical integration is the battery management system (BMS), where accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is crucial for efficiency performance and longevity. However, research on SOC estimation for sodiumion batteries remains limited. This paper proposes using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for SOC estimation for sodiumion batteries in urban electric vehicles (EVs). The experimental EKF parameter tuning methodology is detailed, filling a gap in existing research. The algorithm performance is evaluated across the full SOC range, under typical disturbances, showing that EKF outperforms the Coulomb counting (CC) method for more accurate SOC estimation in sodium-ion batteries. Validation using a standardized urban driving cycle demonstrates the suitability of the proposed algorithm for small electric vehicles."

    "abstract": "Imaging based on direct matched filtering of one-bit quantized echo signals results in significant degradation of imaging quality, deterioration of the Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR), and the generation of false targets. One-Bit compressed sensing technology enables the recovery of one-bit quantized signals, and under the prior assumption of sparsity in the scene, the one-bit compressed sensing recovery algorithm can reconstruct the scattering characteristics of the scene while effectively suppressing the generation of false targets. However, existing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging algorithms based on one-bit compressed sensing typically employ vector observation models, which leads to high-dimensional matrices and limit their applicability to large-scale sparse imaging scenarios. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity fast one-bit SAR imaging algorithm, which uses a matrix observation model to decompose the vector observation model in two dimensions. Finally, simulation validation was carried out and the experimental results based on point and surface targets verified the effectiveness of the algorithm."

An MIO Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) configuration can measure displacements also along the North-South direction, offering complementary insights to those provided by sun-synchronous satellites.

Key areas of focus include large-scale pre-training, multimodal RS data integration, and RS-specific feature embedding. However, with the growing volume of related publications, it has become challenging for researchers to systematically grasp the progress and trends in this field. Although a few review papers on foundation models in RS exist, this paper stands out by addressing the topic from the perspective of the unique challenges encountered, encompassing aspects of data, methodologies, and applications.

Unlike most existing land use products that often categorize all forest areas into a single class, our benchmark differentiates between three forest types classes: natural forest, planted forest, and tree crops. By leveraging multiple public data sources, we achieve global coverage with this benchmark. We evaluate the forest types dataset using several baseline models, including convolution neural networks and transformer-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to handle multi-modal, multi-temporal satellite data for forest types mapping.

The L1 penalty function, as a sparse representation of the target, is widely used in 3-D SAR imaging. However, as a convex relaxation strategy, the L1 frequently causes bias of the amplitude in SAR imaging and only enhances the sparse features of the target, resulting in the loss of non-sparse structural information. To address above problem, a novel 3-D SAR imaging method with composite sparse and low-rank prior is developed. Firstly, we construct an imaging optimization model integrating the non-convex penalty function and the nuclear norm. Next, we present a multitasking framework that integrates variable splitting and alternating minimization (VSAM) to solve the optimization problem of composite prior, which effectively reduces computational complexity and is applied to high-dimensional imaging scenarios. A series of simulations and real experiments validate the proposed method achieve superior 3-D imaging."

    "abstract": "Encroaching woody plants like Vachellia karroo (V. karroo) cause significant ecological changes to grasslands and savanna biomes and have environmental and socio-economic impacts that negatively affect the livelihoods of farmers and rural communities. Thus, effective control methods are required to manage and monitor V. karroo. Effective management and monitoring of encroaching woody plants require mapping their spatial distribution. The challenge associated with effectively managing V. karroo is that it regenerates quickly and causes vegetation heterogeneity making it difficult to distinguish from other vegetation through low resolution data. This study aimed to discriminate V. karroo from cohabiting vegetation types using in-situ hyperspectral data and simulated Sentinel-2 bands across spring and summer seasons, while also identifying important variables in discriminating V. karroo. Spectral reflectance of the V. karroo and cohabiting vegetation (aloe, mixed bush, grass, and forbs) were collected in October (spring) and December of 2022 (summer). The random forest classifier was used to discriminate V. karroo from cohabiting vegetation types. The study compared the performance of all hyperspectral bands; top 10 important bands selected from hyperspectral data and simulated Sentinel-2 bands in discriminating V. karroo. The results of this study showed that V. karroo can be discriminated using all hyperspectral bands, and simulated Sentinel-2 bands. This is evident from the high classification accuracy, with overall accuracies of between 99% and 100% and Kappa values between 0.995 and 1.00, when discriminating V. karroo using all hyperspectral bands, the top 10 selected hyperspectral bands, and simulated Sentinel-2 bands. The results also showed that the summer season was the best season to discriminate V. karroo from cohabiting vegetation. The high classification accuracy (between 98.4% and 100%) obtained from simulated Sentinel-2 bands shows the robustness of the random forest classifier and indicates the potential of using Sentinel-2 data to discriminate V. karroo."

To reduce the loss caused by landslide, it is important to monitor the occurrence of landslide and give an alarm in time. At present, there are two mainstream technical routes for landslide monitoring, namely with IoT sensors and with satellite imagery. However, IoT sensors cannot monitor large area of land, while satellite image cannot alarm in time. In this paper, we present monitoring landslide with surveillance cameras, which are able to cover large area of land, and to send alarm promptly. To detect landslide on surveillance camera image, we use deep learning based change detection technology, which can tell newly occurred landslide from historical landslide scar. Furthermore, AIGC technology is used to build up a dataset to train the landslide change detection model."

Then, a more complete non-linear model is developed to take in account the measurement uncertainty introduced by the circuit non-linear components. This non-linear model is compared to a time domain description of the circuit and it is verified that it can predict the non-linear behavior with a precision better than 20%. This result enables the circuit designers to compensate for these effects and ultimately reduce the overall measurement uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Diamond Valley (DV) is a key agricultural basin in Central Nevada that fully relies on groundwater for irrigation, with alfalfa and grass hay being the dominant crops. Due to excessive groundwater pumping, particularly in southern DV, groundwater levels have declined by almost 25 m (80 ft) over the past fifty years. As a result of groundwater overdrafts, the Nevada State Engineer’s office designated DV as a \"Critical Management Area\" in 2015. Despite the formulation and implementation of the DV groundwater management plan, to date, there have been no research that investigated groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in this region. Here, we conducted the first short baseline subset (SBAS) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis using Sentinel-1 data and compared the estimated subsidence with in-situ groundwater level records and OpenET-based groundwater pumping estimates. Our results indicate that, between 2014 and 2024, central DV experienced land subsidence (more than 600 mm, or 2 ft), which can be attributed to the presence of unconsolidated clays in the basin fill deposits across the valley floors, increased groundwater pumping for irrigation, and the resulting decline in groundwater levels. Moreover, some of these high-subsidence areas have existing infrastructure like houses and roads, potentially leading to future risks. While further research is needed to comprehensively validate these findings, this study represents the first use of SBAS InSAR to investigate groundwater pumping-driven land subsidence in Nevada, establishing a framework for monitoring land deformation (subsidence and uplift) throughout the state and evaluating the associated infrastructure risks."

A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is integrated with the GPS approximation method to improve navigation performance under adversarial conditions. The framework has been tested under two GPS attack models, demonstrating its ability to handle small deviations while revealing limitations in correcting larger biases. Experimental results demonstrate successful navigation in both straight-line and waypoint-based scenarios, establishing a foundation for future work focused on mitigating sensor manipulation through reverseengineering techniques and improved GPS tracking systems."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image classification is a challenge because this type of images are contaminated with speckle noise, an interference phenomenon which is non additive and non Gaussian. Then, statistical modeling of SAR data is essential. The ${\\mathcal{G}}_I^0$ distribution is a good selection because it can describe a wide variety of targets, and for this expressiveness, it is often referred to as the “Universal Model.” It is governed by three parameters: the number of looks L, the roughness α, and the scale γ. By estimating the parameter values from SAR data samples, it is possible to obtain relevant information about an image area, hence the importance of developing an accurate estimation method. Unfortunately, classical methods of estimating statistical parameters fail when applied to the ${\\mathcal{G}}_I^0$ distribution. The goal of this work is parameter estimation of the ${\\mathcal{G}}_I^0$ distribution by using a low-cost neural network. We apply these estimates to classify synthetic SAR images with promising results."

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning (RSICC) has emerged as a significant research focus. This task aims to describe the changes between bi-temporal remote sensing image pairs using natural language. It provides valuable insights into geospatial understanding and land planning. However, the ability to detect changes and generate accurate descriptions is strongly constrained by the generative capacity of models and the quality of datasets. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based framework for RSICC, leveraging the generative power of diffusion models (DMs). Furthermore, in RSICC tasks, the most commonly used dataset LEVIR-CC has significant issues related to sample imbalance. Therefore, we devise a novel data augmentation strategy to supplement the LEVIR-CC dataset by swapping the temporal order of change image pairs. And we utilize a large language model (GPT-4) to generate antonymous captions for the new image pairs. On the augmented LEVIR-CC dataset, our diffusion-based framework demonstrates superior performance across various metrics, outperforming existing methods and showcasing the robustness of our approach. Dataset and relevant materials are available at https://github.com/Fay-Y/The-augmented-LEVIR-CC."

Existing ESAD methods are typically trained on datasets containing specific types of anomalies, achieving satisfactory performance on these known categories but exhibiting limitations when addressing unknown or unexpected anomaly types. We propose ESAD-GPT, a novel vision-language model (VLM) tailored for ESAD task, exploring the utilization of VLM to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we introduce an automated pipeline for generating image caption by utilizing the Google’s Gemini model with tailored prompts designed for various image types, ultimately creating a comprehensive multi-modal ESAD (MM-ESAD) dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model using the LoRA technique, integrating carefully crafted user instructions to prompt the model towards learning generalized anomaly concepts rather than specific category information. This approach improves the model’s generalization capabilities and its adaptability to novel anomaly categories. Experimental results on the MM-ESAD dataset demonstrate that our ESAD-GPT improves accuracy by 5.33% compared to existing SOTA models, exhibiting superior zero-shot performance, and highlighting its potential for broader applications."

Rice area mapping was done through k-means clustering of Vertical Horizontal (VH) backscatter and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. The method was validated using 109 known rice plots, achieving an accuracy of 85.08% across the study area. Transplanting dates were estimated based on minimum VH backscatter values, with an average estimation error of 4.39 days and a median error of 4 days. The phenological stages derived from this analysis were critical for assessing temporal isolation. An integrated cross-pollination risk assessment was conducted by incorporating spatial buffers, temporal isolation checks, and wind speed adjustments. The results showed that 71% of plots were classified as low risk, 19% as medium risk, and 10% as high risk. The proposed approach effectively combines spatial, temporal, and environmental factors to evaluate cross-pollination risks. It provides an efficient and scalable tool for initial cross-pollination risk assessment. This approach leverages freely available satellite data, making it a cost-effective and practical solution for hybrid seed producers seeking to optimize genetic purity and production efficiency."

Using geostationary satellite imagery combined with an adaptive threshold algorithm, we extracted severe convective clouds, and leveraged GPM precipitation data and ERA5-Land reanalysis data to obtain severe convective weather information. The spatial relationship between convective points and clouds was then examined using buffer and overlay analysis, and the internal convective weather regions within clouds were segmented using the Deeplab V3 model. Results show that: (1) identified cloud regions are consistent with high reflectivity areas in radar images; (2) 90% of severe convective weather events occur within the cloud interior or within a 40km buffer from the cloud boundary; (3) the Deeplab V3 model achieved a segmentation mIoU(mean Intersection over Union) of 78% and an accuracy of 85% for severe convection within the clouds. This paper combines statistical, spatial analysis, and deep learning to reveal the close spatial correlation between severe convective weather and severe convective clouds, confirming that severe convection weather is prevalent within cloud interiors and at their boundaries. This study holds significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of severe convective weather and improving forecasting accuracy."

This model includes ground wires, which are used to facilitate zero-sequence current flow. For high fidelity modelling, each span of the transmission line is represented. A 200km, 500kV line is used as case study. Second, a phase-to-ground fault is then introduced at the midpoint of the line, after which the faulted phase is disconnected, and asymmetric operation is achieved using E-STATCOMs (located at the line extremities) equipped with advanced control methodologies that compensate the circulation of negative and zero sequence currents.

    "abstract": "The hybrid topology with a modular multilevel converter-based (MMC-based) auxiliary converter and diode rectifiers connected in paralleled (DR-MMC) has emerged as a promising solution for offshore wind power transmission. To reduce the submodule (SM) number of this hybrid topology, an amplitude-varying high-frequency voltage injection method is proposed in this paper. The amplitude of the injected highfrequency voltage is changing with the instantaneous value of the fundamental output voltage. Thus, the high-frequency voltage can be injected without increasing the SM number of arms. By replacing the MMC with a three-phase seriesconnected MMC (SC-MMC), the AC side voltage is unaffected by injection. Meanwhile, the amplitude fluctuations of injected high-frequency voltage can be canceled out on the DC side. As a result, the high-frequency voltage with constant amplitude can be injected in the DC side of SC-MMC without increasing the SM number. Therefore, the SM number of the converter can be further reduced. The equation of injected high-frequency voltage is derived, and the SM number of the proposed and existing methods are compared. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified via 800-kV 110-MW/330-Mvar simulation."

This work focuses on extending the improved geometric optics with topography (IGOT) GNSS-R DDM model to account for the vegetation attenuation effect in the scattered signal from the ground surface and the vegetation direct scattering. The IGOT model estimates DDMs over topographical surfaces and has been validated against Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission observations. The developed vegetation scattering model is based on the distorted Born approximation (DBA) and represents tree components as finite canonical shapes. The normalized bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) (NBRCS) values of vegetation scattering for various forest types are presented. Additionally, using parameters from CYGNSS, simulated DDMs are studied. The results showed that the vegetation volume scattering contribution is negligible compared to surface scattering.

Given the size of water use in irrigation, using more efficient water management will lead to a great impact on freshwater resources. Soil moisture probes are widely used in irrigation, but sampling is only available \"point-wise\", not necessarily representing the overall water need over fields. To measure soil moisture comprehensively, our joint research exploits the L-band microwaves reflected off land surface and ubiquitously available from the GNSS constellation. The GNSS signal’s reflectance changes with soil moisture content and is sensitive to wider areas in contrast to point-wise ground probes. Here, we present early results from cross-validation of three GNSS remote sensing systems from satellite (CYGNSS), airborne (Rongowai), and ground-borne sensors, which work in the identical principle but at different resolutions and coverages. In this research, we are conducting field campaigns of co-located experiments and extensive calibration and validation of three different types of GNSS-based soil moisture data. Ultimately, we will develop a soil moisture data assimilation system to put all together with land surface models for practical applications in agricultural and farming practice."
