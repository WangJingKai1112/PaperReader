    "abstract": "The static and dynamic electric dipole polarizabilities of the $5s^2~^1\\!S_0$ and $5s5p~^3\\!P_{0,2}$ states of Sr atoms are calculated using the relativistic configuration interaction plus the many-body perturbation theory (RCI+MBPT) method. Magic wavelengths are determined for the transitions $5s^2~^1\\!S_0\\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\\!P_{0}$, $5s^2~^1\\!S_0\\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\\!P_{2}$, and $5s5p~^3\\!P_0\\rightarrow 5s5p~^3\\!P_{2}$. A comprehensive study is conducted on the dependence of magic wavelengths on the angle between the laser polarization and the magnetic field. Furthermore, the conditions for realizing triple magic trapping at 813.4~nm for the $5s^2~^1\\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\\!P_{0}$ and $5s5p~^3\\!P_{2}$ states are investigated. In the case of linearly polarized light, when the angle ($θ_p$) between the laser polarization direction and the magnetic field is $79.1(0.7)^\\circ$, triple magic trapping for the $5s^2~^1\\!S_0$, $5s5p~^3\\!P_{0}$, and $5s5p~^3\\!P_{2}~M=0$ states can be achieved. This result agrees well with the recent experimental measurement (78.49(3)$^\\circ$)[Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 143401 (2025)]. Meanwhile, triple magic trapping involving the $5s5p~^3\\!P_{2}~M=2$ state can be achieved when $θ_p= 37.4(0.3)^\\circ$. The conditions for achieving triple magic trapping with circularly and arbitrarily elliptically polarized light are also presented."

    "abstract": "Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) systems encounter substantial challenges in dynamic environments where moving objects compromise tracking accuracy and map consistency. This paper introduces PCR-ORB (Point Cloud Refinement ORB), an enhanced ORB-SLAM3 framework that integrates deep learning-based point cloud refinement to mitigate dynamic object interference. Our approach employs YOLOv8 for semantic segmentation combined with CUDA-accelerated processing to achieve real-time performance. The system implements a multi-stage filtering strategy encompassing ground plane estimation, sky region removal, edge filtering, and temporal consistency validation. Comprehensive evaluation on the KITTI dataset (sequences 00-09) demonstrates performance characteristics across different environmental conditions and scene types. Notable improvements are observed in specific sequences, with sequence 04 achieving 25.9% improvement in ATE RMSE and 30.4% improvement in ATE median. However, results show mixed performance across sequences, indicating scenario-dependent effectiveness. The implementation provides insights into dynamic object filtering challenges and opportunities for robust navigation in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Multicomponent vesicles suspended in viscoelastic fluids are crucial for understanding a variety of physiological processes. In this work, we develop a continuum surface force (CSF) phase-field model to investigate the hydrodynamics of inextensible multicomponent vesicles in viscoelastic fluid flows with inertial forces. Our model couples a fluid field comprising both Newtonian and Oldroyd-B fluids, a surface concentration field representing the multicomponent distribution on the vesicle membrane, and a phase-field variable governing the membrane evolution. The viscoelasticity effect of extra stress is well incorporated into the full Navier-Stokes equations in the fluid field. The surface concentration field is determined by Cahn-Hilliard equations, while the membrane evolution is governed by a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation. The membrane is coupled to the surrounding fluid through the continuum surface force (CSF) framework. To ensure stable numerical solutions of the highly nonlinear multi-field model, we employ a residual-based variational multiscale (RBVMS) method for the Navier-Stokes equations, a Streamline-Upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the Oldroyd-B equations, and a standard Galerkin finite element framework for the remaining equations. The system of PDEs is solved using an implicit, monolithic scheme based on the generalized-$α$ time integration method. To enhance spatial accuracy, we employ isogeometric analysis (IGA). We present a series of two-dimensional numerical examples in shear and Poiseuille flows to elucidate the influence of membrane composition and fluid viscoelasticity on the hydrodynamics of multicomponent vesicles."

    "abstract": "Directional memory in amorphous solids is commonly quantified through the Bauschinger effect, yet the observation of the inverse Bauschinger effect suggests that the sign of memory can invert, pointing to distinct underlying plastic organization. Here, we connect directional memory to the nature of yielding in steadily sheared amorphous solids. Using simulations of two-dimensional polydisperse glasses, we show that the type of directional memory (Bauschinger versus inverse Bauschinger) is jointly controlled by deformation history, strain rate, and parent temperature. We identify a critical history amplitude $γ_{N,\\mathrm{crit}}(T_p,\\dotγ)$ and construct a phase diagram that delineates regimes with memory inversion from those showing only conventional Bauschinger response. Microscopically, memory inversion correlates with network-like shear-band morphology and plastic healing, whereas conventional memory is associated with persistent localization and cumulative damage. These results establish directional memory as an order parameter for a shear-rate and annealing-controlled brittle-ductile crossover and suggest that plastic healing provides a generic route to memory inversion in disordered solids."

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\\tilde{u} = A + B \\cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored. Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape. A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law. This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel. Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers. It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction. Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning."

    "abstract": "Given the central role of green e-molecule imports in the European energy transition, many studies optimize import pathways and identify a single cost-optimal solution. However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a simplified single reed instrument model subject to a stochastic forcing of white noise type when one of its bifurcation parameters (the dimensionless blowing pressure) increases linearly over time and crosses the Hopf bifurcation point of its trivial equilibrium position. The stochastic slow dynamics of the model is first obtained by means of the stochastic averaging method. The resulting averaged system reduces to a non-autonomous one-dimensional It{ô} stochastic differential equation governing the time evolution of the mouthpiece pressure amplitude. Under relevant approximations the latter is solved analytically treating separately cases where noise can be ignored and cases where it cannot. From that, two analytical expressions of the bifurcation parameter value for which the mouthpiece pressure amplitude gets its initial value back are deduced. These special values of the bifurcation parameter characterize the effective appearance of sound in the instrument and are called deterministic dynamic bifurcation point if the noise can be neglected and stochastic dynamic bifurcation point otherwise. Finally, for illustration and validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with direct numerical integration of the model in both deterministic and stochastic situations. In each considered case, a good agreement is observed between theoretical results and numerical simulations, which validates the proposed analysis."

Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \\times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\\sqrt{7}a_0 \\times \\sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\\sqrt{7}a_0 \\times \\sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder."

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized inspection tasks by offering a safer, more efficient, and flexible alternative to traditional methods. However, battery limitations often constrain their effectiveness, necessitating the development of optimized flight paths and data collection techniques. While existing approaches like coverage path planning (CPP) ensure comprehensive data collection, they can be inefficient, especially when inspecting multiple non connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). This paper introduces the Fast Inspection of Scattered Regions (FISR) problem and proposes a novel solution, the multi UAV Disjoint Areas Inspection (mUDAI) method. The introduced approach implements a two fold optimization procedure, for calculating the best image capturing positions and the most efficient UAV trajectories, balancing data resolution and operational time, minimizing redundant data collection and resource consumption. The mUDAI method is designed to enable rapid, efficient inspections of scattered ROIs, making it ideal for applications such as security infrastructure assessments, agricultural inspections, and emergency site evaluations. A combination of simulated evaluations and real world deployments is used to validate and quantify the method's ability to improve operational efficiency while preserving high quality data capture, demonstrating its effectiveness in real world operations. An open source Python implementation of the mUDAI method can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/soc12/mUDAI) and the collected and processed data from the real world experiments are all hosted on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/13866483).

    "abstract": "The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions."

    "abstract": "Estimating covariance matrices with high-dimensional complex data presents significant challenges, particularly concerning positive definiteness, sparsity, and numerical stability. Existing robust sparse estimators often fail to guarantee positive definiteness in finite samples, while subsequent positive-definite correction can degrade sparsity and lack explicit control over the condition number. To address these limitations, we propose a novel robust and well-conditioned sparse covariance matrix estimator. Our key innovation is the direct incorporation of a condition number constraint within a robust adaptive thresholding framework. This constraint simultaneously ensures positive definiteness, enforces a controllable level of numerical stability, and preserves the desired sparse structure without resorting to post-hoc modifications that compromise sparsity. We formulate the estimation as a convex optimization problem and develop an efficient alternating direction algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Theoretically, we establish that the proposed estimator achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate under the Frobenius norm. Comprehensive simulations and real-data applications demonstrate that our method consistently produces positive definite, well-conditioned, and sparse estimates, and achieves comparable or superior numerical stability to eigenvalue-bound methods while requiring less tuning parameters."

Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems."

Specifically, we conceive a comprehensive ISAC architecture, where an UM-MIMO base station adopts OCDM waveform for communications and a co-located sensing receiver adopts the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) detection principle to simplify the associated hardware. For sensing tasks, several OCDM subcarriers, namely, dedicated sensing subcarriers (DSSs), are each transmitted through a dedicated sensing antenna (DSA) within the transmit antenna array. By judiciously designing the DSS selection scheme and optimizing receiver parameters, the FMCW-based sensing receiver can decouple the echo signals from different DSAs with significantly reduced hardware complexity. This setup enables the estimation of ranges and velocities of near-field targets in an antenna-pairwise manner. Moreover, by leveraging the spatial diversity of UM-MIMO, we introduce the concept of virtual bistatic sensing (VIBS), which incorporates the estimates from multiple antenna pairs to achieve high-accuracy target positioning and three-dimensional velocity measurement. The VIBS paradigm is immune to hostile channel environments characterized by spatial non-stationarity and uncorrelated multipath environment. Furthermore, the channel estimation of UM-MIMO OCDM systems enhanced by the sensing results is investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC scheme enhances sensing accuracy, and also benefits communication performance."

These portals give rise to several possible new particles beyond the SM, such as light Higgs bosons, dark photons, axion-like particles, or spin-1/2 fermions. Furthermore, the origin of DM and the observed asymmetry between visible matter and antimatter may be connected through the introduction of a dark baryon.

    "abstract": "Human-vehicle cooperative driving serves as a vital bridge to fully autonomous driving by improving driving flexibility and gradually building driver trust and acceptance of autonomous technology. To establish more natural and effective human-vehicle interaction, we propose a Human-Oriented Cooperative Driving (HOCD) approach that primarily minimizes human-machine conflict by prioritizing driver intention and state. In implementation, we take both tactical and operational levels into account to ensure seamless human-vehicle cooperation. At the tactical level, we design an intention-aware trajectory planning method, using intention consistency cost as the core metric to evaluate the trajectory and align it with driver intention. At the operational level, we develop a control authority allocation strategy based on reinforcement learning, optimizing the policy through a designed reward function to achieve consistency between driver state and authority allocation. The results of simulation and human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach not only aligns with driver intention in trajectory planning but also ensures a reasonable authority allocation. Compared to other cooperative driving approaches, the proposed HOCD approach significantly enhances driving performance and mitigates human-machine conflict.The code is available at https://github.com/i-Qin/HOCD."

    "abstract": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence."

Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information.

Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection\" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs."

We detail the application of these paradigms across the digital chip design flow, including the construction of agentic cognitive architectures based on multimodal foundation models, frontend RTL code generation and intelligent verification, and backend physical design featuring algorithmic innovations and tool orchestration. We validate these methodologies through integrated case studies, demonstrating practical viability from microarchitecture definition to GDSII.

Furthermore, this survey delves into the dual-faceted impact on security, covering novel adversarial risks, automated vulnerability repair, and privacy-preserving infrastructure. Finally, the paper critically summarizes current challenges related to hallucinations, data scarcity, and black-box tools, and outlines future trends towards L4 autonomous chip design.

We carried out a survey to inform our model and stratify the population into six groups based on income and perception of authority, capturing behavioral heterogeneity. Individuals adjust their socialization and vaccination levels to optimize objectives such as minimizing treatment costs, complying with social-distancing guidelines if they are authority-followers, or reducing losses from decreased social interactions if they are authority-indifferents, alongside economic costs. Public health authorities influence behavior through social-distancing guidelines and vaccination costs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium via a forward-backward differential equation system, provide its mathematical analysis, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve it. Our findings reveal a trade-off between social-distancing and vaccination decisions. Under stricter guidelines that target both susceptible and infected individuals, followers reduce both socialization and vaccination levels, while indifferents increase socialization due to followers' preventative measures. Adaptive guidelines targeting infected individuals effectively reduce infections and narrow the gap between low- and high-income groups, even when susceptible individuals socialize more and vaccinate less. Lower vaccination costs incentivize vaccination among low-income groups, but their impact on disease spread is smaller than when they are coupled with social-distancing guidelines. Trust-building emerges as a critical factor in epidemic mitigation, underscoring the importance of data-informed, game-theoretical models that aim to understand complex human responses to mitigation policies."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of fields. However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts."

Two lifting functions are constructed via training neural networks, which generate mapped input and mapped output in a higher-dimensional space, where the nonlinear economic cost function can be approximated using a quadratic function of the mapped variables. The data-enabled predictive control framework is extended to address nonlinear dynamics by using the mapped input and the mapped output that belong to a virtual linear representation, which serves as an approximation of the original nonlinear system. Additionally, we reconstruct the system output variables from the mapped output, on which hard output constraints are imposed. The online control problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem, despite the nonlinearity of the system dynamics and the original economic cost function. Theoretical analysis is presented to justify the suitability of the proposed method for nonlinear systems. We evaluate the proposed method through two large-scale industrial case studies: (i) a biological water treatment process, and (ii) a solvent-based shipboard post-combustion carbon capture process. These studies demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

The ADM criterion that at least $99\\%$ of the dark matter relic density is asymmetric is also imposed. We identify which of these scenarios are currently allowed by direct detection and collider constraints, and then determine how much more of the parameter space could be probed by 3 and 10 TeV muon colliders with 1 ab$^{-1}$ of data. For the UV models, the constraints from $g-2$ of the muon are included. The future sensitivity curves due to neutron star heating considerations are also depicted.

In this work, we develop a two-stage respiratory motion-resolved radial MR image reconstruction pipeline using an interpretable deep unrolled network (MoraNet), enabling high-quality imaging under free-breathing conditions. Firstly, low-resolution images are reconstructed from the central region of successive golden-angle radial k-space to extract respiratory motion signals. The binned k-space data based on the respiratory signal are then used to reconstruct the motion-resolved high-resolution image for each motion state. The MoraNet applies nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to operate radial encoding and convolutional neural network (CNN) modules to conduct image regularizations. The MoraNet was trained on retrospectively acquired lung MRI images for both fully sampled and undersampled acquisitions. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on digital CT/MRI breathing XCAT (CoMBAT) phantom data, QUASAR motion phantom data acquired from a 1.0T MRI scanner and volunteer chest data acquired from a 1.5T MRI scanner. The MoraNet pipeline was compared with motion-averaged reconstruction and a conventional compressed sensing (CS)-based method in terms of SSIM, RMSE and computation time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network could provide accurate respiratory signal estimation and enable effective motion correction. Compared with the CS method, the MoraNet preserved better structural details with lower RMSE and higher SSIM values at acceleration factor of 4, and meanwhile took ten-fold faster inference time."

    "abstract": "Attenuation bias -- the systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to measurement errors in input variables -- affects astronomical data-driven models. For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

In this work, we introduce the Universal Robot Description Directory (URDD), a modular representation that organizes derived robot information into structured, easy-to-parse JSON and YAML modules. Our open-source toolkit automatically generates URDDs from URDFs, with a Rust implementation supporting Bevy-based visualization. Additionally, we provide a JavaScript/Three.js viewer for web-based inspection of URDDs. Experiments on multiple robot platforms show that URDDs can be generated efficiently, encapsulate substantially richer information than standard specification files, and directly enable the construction of core robotics subroutines. URDD provides a unified, extensible resource for reducing redundancy and establishing shared standards across robotics frameworks.

This framework effectively balances strong sparsity promotion with solution stability, and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional variable selection involving highly correlated features. Built upon a difference-of-convex (DC) structure, DCEN employs two continuously tunable parameters to unify classical and state-of-the-art models--including Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge, and $\\ell_1-α\\ell_2$--as special cases. Theoretically, sufficient conditions for exact and stable recovery are established under the restricted isometry property (RIP), and a closed-form expression of the DCEN regularization proximal operator is derived. Moreover, two efficient optimization algorithms are developed based on the DC algorithm (DCA) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Within the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) framework, the global convergence of DCA and its linear convergence rate are rigorously established. Furthermore, DCEN is extended to image reconstruction by incorporating total variation (TV) regularization, yielding the DCEN-TV model, which is efficiently solved via the Split Bregman method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DCEN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sparse signal recovery, high-dimensional variable selection under strong collinearity, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction, achieving superior recovery accuracy and robustness."

Traditional cybersecurity lacks ML-specific threat modeling for foundation, multimodal, and RAG systems. Objective: Characterize ML security risks by identifying dominant TTPs, vulnerabilities, and targeted lifecycle stages. Methods: We extract 93 threats from MITRE ATLAS (26), AI Incident Database (12), and literature (55), and analyze 854 GitHub/Python repositories. A multi-agent RAG system (ChatGPT-4o, temp 0.4) mines 300+ articles to build an ontology-driven threat graph linking TTPs, vulnerabilities, and stages. Results: We identify unreported threats including commercial LLM API model stealing, parameter memorization leakage, and preference-guided text-only jailbreaks. Dominant TTPs include MASTERKEY-style jailbreaking, federated poisoning, diffusion backdoors, and preference optimization leakage, mainly impacting pre-training and inference. Graph analysis reveals dense vulnerability clusters in libraries with poor patch propagation.

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes."

This survey focuses on the critical behavior of closed trajectories in two-dimensional LLGs, starting from the numerical study of Cao and Cohen, and its relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks.

    "abstract": "We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy. Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^α$ interactions."

Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses.

Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs."

    "abstract": "Financial institutions increasingly rely on distributed architectures, open banking APIs, cloud native infrastructures, and high frequency digital transactions. These transformations expand the attack surface and expose limitations in traditional perimeter based security models. While Zero Trust architectures provide essential security principles, most existing frameworks do not explicitly incorporate transactional semantics, financial risk modeling, adaptive identity trust, or automation weighted by economic impact. This paper introduces SecureBank, a financially aware and context adaptive Zero Trust architecture designed specifically for high assurance banking systems. The proposed framework integrates Financial Zero Trust, Adaptive Identity Scoring, Contextual Micro Segmentation, and Impact Driven Security Automation. A Monte Carlo simulation evaluates SecureBank against a representative rule based baseline architecture using metrics such as the Transactional Integrity Index (TII), Identity Trust Adaptation Level (ITAL), and Security Automation Efficiency (SAE). The results demonstrate that SecureBank significantly improves automated attack handling and accelerates identity trust adaptation while preserving conservative and regulator aligned levels of transactional integrity. Beyond experimental validation, SecureBank is intended to serve as a reference architecture and evaluation baseline for financially aware Zero Trust systems in regulated financial environments."

In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| > 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement."

The dispersion relations, which originally come out in the form of logarithmic divergences, in the long wavelength limit exhibit the systematic gradient structure of the relativistic hydrodynamics. The key result is that, in the derivative expansion series, the spatial gradients appear in perfect unison with the temporal gradients in the non-local relaxation operator like forms. It is then shown that this dispersion structure, including non-local temporal derivatives, is essential for the preservation of causality of the theory truncated at any desired order."

    "abstract": "Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and the associated high-momentum tail (HMT) in its momentum distribution $n(k)$ represent a universal feature of strongly interacting Fermi systems. In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of recombination is of crucial importance for the existence of ultracold plasmas, particularly, the ones formed in the magneto-optical traps. Unfortunately, a straightforward simulation of the recombination encounters the problem of huge difference in the spatial and temporal scales for free and bound motion of the electrons. As a result, only the \"virtual\" electron-ion pairs are usually reproduced in such simulations, and it is necessary to employ some additional criteria to identify them with the recombined atoms (this might be a minimal number of revolutions of the electron about the nearest ion or a maximal distance between them). It is the aim of this paper to present the first successful ab initio simulation of the recombination without any auxiliary assumptions. We employed a special algorithm, which was based on: (i) using the \"scalable\" reference frame, co-moving with the expanding plasma, (ii) dynamical choice of the number of \"mirror\" cells, taking into account in calculation of the Coulomb sums, and (iii) accurate treatment of the singular interparticle interactions, without any truncation or \"softening\" of the Coulomb forces. Then, the recombination events are identified by a series of sharp equidistant peaks in the kinetic and/or potential energies for a sample of particles, which are caused by the captured electrons passing near the pericenters of their orbits; and this is confirmed by a detailed inspection of the particle trajectories. Thereby, we were able to trace formation of the real - rather than \"virtual\" - electron-ion pairs. The total efficiency of recombination for the realistic experimental conditions was found to be about 20%, which is in perfect agreement both with the laboratory measurements and with the earlier semi-empirical simulations."

    "abstract": "The influence of gender diversity on the success of scientific teams is of great interest to academia. However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size."

SN 2022eyw reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_g = -17.80\\pm0.15$ mag and exhibited a rise time of $\\sim$15 days, placing it among the brighter Iax events. The bolometric light curve indicates a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.120\\pm0.003~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, with an estimated ejecta mass of $0.79\\pm0.09~\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and kinetic energy of $0.19\\times10^{51}$ erg. The spectral evolution from -8 to +110 days past maximum reveals features characteristic of bright Type Iax Supernovae, including a transition from Fe III to Fe II dominance, moderate expansion velocities, and a lack of strong C III absorption. TARDIS spectral modelling of the early-phase spectra indicates a well-mixed ejecta dominated by Fe-group elements. In addition, traces of unburnt carbon are detected, pointing to incomplete burning as expected in pure deflagration models. Late-time spectral evolution shows a blend of permitted and forbidden lines. Comparison with deflagration models suggests that SN 2022eyw originated from a partial deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, with explosion properties intermediate between the N3-def and N5-def models. These observations support pure deflagration of a CO white dwarf as a viable explosion mechanism for its luminous members."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

For each of these estimators, bounds of the expected excess risk on the class of Hölder smooth functions and composition Hölder functions are established. Applications to independent data, as well as to $φ$-mixing, strongly mixing, $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing processes are considered. For each of these examples, the upper bounds of the expected excess risk of the proposed NPDNN and SPDNN predictors are derived.

    "abstract": "As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains."

    "abstract": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases."

This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms."

MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization.

    "abstract": "Neural scaling laws have become foundational for optimizing large language model (LLM) training, yet they typically assume a single dense model output. This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines."

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior."

This mini-review assesses the prospects for detecting electrically charged long-lived particles using the MoEDAL-MAPP experiment. We synthesize findings from recent studies that evaluate sensitivity to supersymmetric models, radiative neutrino mass scenarios, and generic multiply charged objects. A key component of this review is the comparative analysis of MoEDAL's reach against the general-purpose ATLAS and CMS experiments. We conclude that while MoEDAL is constrained by lower integrated luminosity, its passive, background-free detection methodology offers a unique advantage. Specifically, the experiment provides complementarity to the major detectors, particularly for signals involving slow-moving particles and stable states with intermediate electric charges."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain."

We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase. The singular structure of the RG flows has persisted on including gravitational-couplings, thereby offering further support to the conjecture that \\cPT -symmetric phases of (repulsive) gravity characterise string-effective CS gravitational theories, where the axion is the massless string-model independent axion, which can also play a role of a totally-antisymmetric torsion degree of freedom. This has suggested a novel interpretation of the currently observed acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in terms of such a phase at large (cosmological) scales."

    "abstract": "Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials."

    "abstract": "Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions."

    "abstract": "Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\\forall^*\\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure."

The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property."

    "abstract": "We introduce heterogeneous R&D productivities into an endogenous R&D network formation model, generalizing the framework in Goyal and Moraga-Gonzalez (2001). Heterogeneous productivities endogenously create asymmetric gains for connecting firms: the less productive firm benefits disproportionately, while the more productive firm exerts greater R&D effort and incurs higher costs. For sufficiently large productivity gaps between two firms, the more productive firm experiences reduced profits from being connected to the less productive one. This overturns the benchmark results on pairwise stable networks: for sufficiently large productivity gaps, the complete network becomes unstable, whereas the Positive Assortative (PA) network -- where firms cluster by productivity levels -- emerges as stable. Simulations show that the PA structure delivers higher welfare than the complete network; nevertheless, welfare under PA formation follows an inverted U-shape in the fraction of high-productivity firms, reflecting crowding-out effects at high fractions. Altogether, a counterintuitive finding emerges: economies with higher average R&D productivity may exhibit lower welfare through (i) the formation of alternative stable R&D network structures or (ii) a crowding-out effect of high-productivity firms. Our findings highlight that productivity-enhancing policies should account for their impact on endogenous R&D alliances and effort, as such endogenous responses may offset or even reverse the intended welfare gains."

    "abstract": "We investigate the expected star discrepancy under a newly designed class of convex equivolume partition models. The main contributions are two-fold. First, we establish a strong partition principle for the star discrepancy, showing that our newly designed partitions yield stratified sampling point sets with lower expected star discrepancy than both classical jittered sampling and simple random sampling. Specifically, we prove that $\\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Z))\\leq\\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(Y))<\\mathbb{E}(D^{*}_{N}(X))$, where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ represent simple random sampling, jittered sampling, and our new partition sampling, respectively. Second, we derive explicit upper bounds for the expected star discrepancy under our partition models, which improve upon existing bounds for jittered sampling. Our results resolve Open Question 2 posed in Kiderlen and Pausinger (2021) regarding the strong partition principle for star discrepancy."

The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA. This research also demonstrates the potential of free and user-friendly tools such as QGIS for accurate mapping within their limitations, supporting global environmental monitoring and conservation efforts."

    "abstract": "The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints."

Given a model response, an annotator provides fine-grained feedback by marking ``liked'' and ``disliked'' spans and specifying what they liked or disliked about them. The base model then rewrites the disliked spans accordingly, proceeding from left to right, forming a sequence of incremental improvements. We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits. We find that our approach outperforms direct alignment methods based on standard A/B preference ranking or full contrastive rewrites, demonstrating that structured, revision-based supervision leads to more efficient and effective preference tuning."

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available."

    "abstract": "The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \\RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N <= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority."

    "abstract": "Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019]. We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine."

This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing.

We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\\mathcal H_{\\rm out}\\otimes \\mathcal H_{\\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\\rm in}+t_{\\rm out}$."

Classic BO, which targets a single optimum over all parameters, does not explore the entire control parameter range. Instead, we develop a novel two-stage acquisition scheme to balance exploration across the control parameter and exploitation of the profile optima, leveraging deep and shallow Gaussian process surrogates to facilitate uncertainty quantification. We are motivated by a computer simulation of a diffuser in a rotating detonation combustion engine, which returns the energy lost through diffusion as a function of various design parameters. We aim to identify the lowest possible energy loss as a function of the diffuser's length; understanding this relationship will enable well-informed design choices. Our ``profile Bayesian optimization'' procedure outperforms traditional BO and profile optimization methods on a variety of benchmarks and proves effective in our motivating application."

    "abstract": "Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction."

However, autonomous driving software requires real-time performance as it considers a variety of functions and complex environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a parallelization method for autonomous driving software using the Model-Based Development (MBD) process. The proposed method extends the existing Model-Based Parallelizer (MBP) method to facilitate the implementation of complex processing. As a result, execution time was reduced. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for the development of autonomous driving software, particularly in achieving real-time performance."

    "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of estimating grouping structures and factor loadings in asset pricing models, where traditional regressions struggle due to sparse data and high noise. Existing approaches, such as those using fused penalties and multi-task learning, often enforce coefficient homogeneity across cross-sectional units, reducing flexibility. Clustering methods (e.g., spectral clustering, Lloyd's algorithm) achieve consistent recovery under specific conditions but typically rely on a single data source. To address these limitations, we introduce the Panel Coupled Matrix-Tensor Clustering (PMTC) model, which simultaneously leverages a characteristics tensor and a return matrix to identify latent asset groups. By integrating these data sources, we develop computationally efficient tensor clustering algorithms that enhance both clustering accuracy and factor loading estimation. Simulations demonstrate that our methods outperform single-source alternatives in clustering accuracy and coefficient estimation, particularly under moderate signal-to-noise conditions. Empirical application to U.S. equities demonstrates the practical value of PMTC, yielding higher out-of-sample total $R^2$ and economically interpretable variation in factor exposures."

However, such measures do not directly quantify the operational usefulness of optical structure for parameter estimation and sensing. Here we introduce Fisher information as an operational metric to assess the metrological content of structured optical fields. By treating the measured intensity distribution as a statistical object, we define Fisher information with respect to physically relevant parameters, such as transverse displacement. We demonstrate that optical modes with comparable Shannon entropy can exhibit markedly different Fisher information, revealing sensitivity features associated with nodal structure and local curvature. Using Hermite--Gaussian modes as minimal test cases, we show that increasing modal order systematically enhances Fisher information. We then extend the analysis to two widely used families in structured light: Laguerre--Gaussian vortex beams and finite-energy Bessel--Gauss beams. Across these representative families, Fisher information provides a unified and experimentally accessible criterion for comparing structured optical fields in sensing applications."

Conventional time-series and machine learning approaches, which rely primarily on historical correlations, often struggle to generalize when the economic environment changes. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities for processing unstructured information, their potential to support quantitative factor screening through explicit economic reasoning remains underexplored. Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. Alpha-R1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency. Empirical results across multiple asset pools show that Alpha-R1 consistently outperforms benchmark strategies and exhibits improved robustness to alpha decay.

Higher-order WKB corrections are included, extending the correspondence beyond the leading eikonal regime. For gravitational perturbations, the predicted grey-body factors agree with numerical results obtained from the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura equation, with increasing accuracy at large angular quantum number.

In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions."

In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to 6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision."

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes. Under strict anti-leakage controls, MIRAGE-VC achieves +5.0% F1 and +16.6% PrecisionAt5, and sheds light on other off-graph prediction tasks such as recommendation and risk assessment.

The available frameworks like SLSA, SBOM and in toto are majorly used to offer provenance and traceability but do not have the capabilities of actively identifying and removing vulnerabilities in software production. The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines. These results show that agentic AI can facilitate the transition to self defending, proactive software supply chains rather than reactive verification ones."

To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

    "abstract": "Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $ζ$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity -- central to the holographic principle -- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales."

The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning."

    "abstract": "We study the identification of differentiated product demand with exogenous supply-side instruments, allowing product characteristics to be endogenous. Past analyses have argued that exogenous characteristic-based instruments are essentially necessary given a sufficiently flexible demand model with a suitable index restriction. We show, however, that price counterfactuals are nonparametrically identified by recentered instruments -- which combine exogenous shocks to prices with endogenous product characteristics -- under a weaker index restriction and a new condition we term faithfulness. We argue that faithfulness, like the usual completeness condition for nonparametric identification with instruments, can be viewed as a technical requirement on the richness of identifying variation rather than a substantive economic restriction, and we show that it holds under a variety of non-nested conditions on either price-setting or the index."

A finite collection of convex bodies in Euclidean $d$-space is called a non-separable family (or NS-family) if every hyperplane intersecting their convex hull also intersects at least one member of the family. Recent work has focused on minimal coverings of NS-families consisting of positive homothetic convex bodies. In this paper, we strengthen these results by establishing their analogues for weakly non-separable families of convex polytopes. We further obtain stability results and analyze maximal weakly non-separable families of cubes. As an additional extension, we also examine weakly $k$-impassable families of convex $d$-polytopes for $0<k<d-1$."

We classify the centrality and commutativity of these skew-polynomial algebras depending on the Lie type and the order of $ζ$ modulo 8. We describe Hopf ideals in the quantum group induced from ideals in these subalgebras, including the non-commutative cases. Among these, we construct and analyze a family of Hopf ideals that depend on the choice of an element in the Weyl group. We show that they arise naturally both in the construction of (partial) $R$-matrices and as vanishing ideals of Bruhat subgroups. Specialization to the maximal element yields a rigorous construction of restricted quantum groups as pre-triangular Hopf algebras, independent of any choices. Our treatment also includes even orders of $ζ$, non-simply laced Lie types, and minimal ground rings. Consequently, we extend some results of De Concini-Kac-Procesi, whose work focuses on odd orders of $ζ$, which forces the subalgebra to be strictly central, and complex ground fields. This includes the identification of the subalgebras for Lie types $\\mathsf{A}_n$ and $\\mathsf{B}_2$ with the coordinate rings of associated algebraic groups in the commutative cases, even if $ζ$ has even order. Our descriptions are computationally explicit and do not utilize Poisson structures. As technical preparations, we discuss PBW bases over minimal rings, dependencies on choices of convex orderings, as well as various new constructions of, and relations among, automorphisms on quantum groups. The latter include formulae for the Garside element in the Lustzig-Artin group action and the family of Che-transformations."

Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL).

To isolate and evaluate these faculties, we introduce CubeBench, a novel generative benchmark centered on the Rubik's Cube. CubeBench uses a three-tiered diagnostic framework that progressively assesses agent capabilities, from foundational state tracking with full symbolic information to active exploration with only partial visual data. Our experiments on leading LLMs reveal critical limitations, including a uniform 0.00% pass rate on all long-horizon tasks, exposing a fundamental failure in long-term planning. We also propose a diagnostic framework to isolate these cognitive bottlenecks by providing external solver tools.

Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance. Practitioners expect GenAI to redefine rather than replace their roles, while expressing moderate concern about job market contraction and skill shifts."

This note explains why the Rashomon phenomenon can be understood as a \\emph{failure of gluing}: local descriptions over different contexts exist, but they do not admit a single global ``all-perspectives-at-once'' description. This is the same mathematical obstruction that underlies modern sheaf-theoretic treatments of contextuality. I then indicate why the same perspective is useful in parts of the social sciences (quantum-like modelling of cognition, judgment, and decision-making), where ``context effects'' can likewise be interpreted as the absence of a single joint probability space."

In the present work, the objective is to understand and implement dereverberation techniques that aim at enhancing the magnitude spectrogram of reverberant speech signals to remove the reverberant effects introduced. An approach to estimate a clean speech spectrogram from the reverberant speech spectrogram is proposed. This is achieved through non-negative matrix factor deconvolution(NMFD). Further, this approach is extended using the NMF representation for speech magnitude spectrograms. To exploit temporal dependencies, a convolutive NMF-based representation and a frame-stacked model are incorporated into the NMFD framework for speech. A novel approach for dereverberation by applying NMFD to the activation matrix of the reverberated magnitude spectrogram is also proposed. Finally, a comparative analysis of the performance of the listed techniques, using sentence recordings from the TIMIT database and recorded room impulse responses from the Reverb 2014 challenge, is presented based on two key objective measures - PESQ and Cepstral Distortion.\\\\ Although we were qualitatively able to verify the claims made in literature regarding these techniques, exact results could not be matched. The novel approach, as it is suggested, provides improvement in quantitative metrics, but is not consistent"

In other words, its space-requirements are asymptotically similar to those of the compressed text. In practice, block trees offer comparable query performance to state-of-the-art compressed rank and select indices. However, their construction is significantly slower. Additionally, the fastest construction algorithms require a significant amount of working memory. To address this issue, we propose fast and lightweight parallel algorithms for the efficient construction of block trees. Our algorithm achieves similar speed than the currently fastest construction algorithm on one core and is up to four times faster using 64 cores. It achieves all that while requiring an order of magnitude less memory. As result of independent interest, we present a data parallel algorithm for Karp-Rabin fingerprint computation."

    "abstract": "Sensory prediction (SP) is a fundamental mechanism of perception that supports cognitive development. Atypical SP has been reported across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders (ND), suggesting it may constitute an early cross-syndromic marker. Premature birth is a major risk factor for ND, with risk increasing as gestational age (GA) at birth decreases. However, how perinatal risk factors shape the development of SP remains poorly understood. We do not know if untimely birth itself, or exposure to iatrogenic pain during neonatal intensive care, cause neurodevelopmental impairments. In this study, we first assessed whether SP can be detected in the brains of premature neonates at 35 weeks corrected GA using a tactile oddballomission paradigm with EEG. We then examined the effects of the degree of prematurity and of the exposure to painful care procedures on neural indices of SP. Results demonstrate the presence of repetition suppression (RS) and a mismatch response (MMR) to deviant stimuli in the contralateral somatosensory cortex of premature neonates. The amplitude of these SP proxies was significantly affected by the number of painful procedures experienced since birth, independently of the effect of GA at birth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that greater neurodevelopmental risk would be associated with less mature SP, infants with higher exposure to pain exhibited more robust indices of SP. These findings suggest that increased ex utero experience, even painful, is associated with accelerated maturation of predictive somatosensory processing. Longitudinal follow-up of participants at age 2 will explore how these early markers relate to developmental outcomes."

However, existing methods largely overlook how to efficiently process multiple such queries together, missing opportunities to share redundant computations and thus reduce overall processing costs. To address this, this work is the first to explore batch processing of multiple R$k$NN queries, aiming to minimize total computation by sharing duplicate calculations across queries. To tackle this issue, we propose the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm, which uses rapid verification and pruning strategies based on geometric constraints, along with an optimized range search technique, to speed up the process of identifying the R$k$NNs for each query. Furthermore, it proposes a dynamic distance caching mechanism to enable computation reuse when handling multiple queries, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on multiple real-world road networks demonstrate the superiority of the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm on the processing of batch queries."

Interestingly, we show that the equivalent topological condition in the three--dimensional contact setting consists of having first Betti number equal to 2. In this case, equality in our upper bounds implies that the structure is that of a Heisenberg left--invariant nilmanifold. We conclude by showing that, in some specific three--dimensional contact settings, the knowledge of the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian uniquely determines the manifold Chern class, fully determining the topology of the underlying manifold."

This significantly simplifies the multidimensional screening problem.

However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available."

    "abstract": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation."

In this work, we analyze $Z \\to μμbb$ decays within the SMEFT framework, deriving constraints on dimension-six operators that affect four-fermion interactions between leptons and bottom quarks, as well as $Z$-fermion couplings. Signal and background events are simulated with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tools, including detector effects such as $b$-tagging, and limits on the relevant Wilson coefficients are extracted using kinematic distributions and a profile likelihood approach. Our results provide complementary constraints to existing SMEFT studies and yield the first process-specific limits on flavor-resolved four-fermion operators involving muons and bottom quarks from $Z$ decays."

Specifically, it operates in three stages: For scoring, we use the emerging LLM-as-a-Judge technique to evaluate each response by reusing multiple LLMs at hand; For reasoning, we can apply a principled graphical model-based truth inference algorithm or a straightforward averaging strategy to aggregate multiple scores to produce a final score for each response; Finally, the highest-scoring response is selected as the best ensemble output.

To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans.

The stabilization problem is NP-hard for general descriptor systems. Existing approaches often rely on explicit knowledge of the structure-defining matrix $Q$, which is difficult to determine in practice. When $Q$ is unknown, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which proportional output feedback ensures that the closed-loop system is regular, impulse-free, asymptotically stable, and retains the port-Hamiltonian structure. These conditions also allow any positive definite matrix to serve as the feedback matrix. The framework is further extended to proportional and derivative output feedback, enabling the assignment of a desired dynamical order. The proposed method thus generalizes existing stabilization results from the special case $Q = I$ to systems with an unknown $Q$, offering a systematic method to structure-preserving stabilization of pH descriptor systems."

    "abstract": "Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2{\\frak p}}\\ln^{1-1/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ and ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/{\\frak p}}\\ln^{2-2/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\\rm eff}\\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation."

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods."

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems."

Coupling mechanisms for heterogeneous structural modules should meet all of the following requirements: single-sided coupling and decoupling, flat surfaces when uncoupled, and coupling to passive coupling interfaces as well as coupling behavior between coupling mechanisms. The design requirements for such a coupling mechanism are complex. We propose a novel shape-matching mechanical coupling mechanism that satisfies these design requirements. This mechanism enables controlled, sequential transitions between male and female states. When uncoupled, all mechanisms are in the female state. To enable single-sided coupling, one side of the mechanisms switches to the male state during the coupling process. Single-sided decoupling is possible not only from the male side but also from the female side by forcibly switching the opposite mechanism's male state to the female state. This coupling mechanism can be applied to various modular robot systems and robot arm tool changers."

In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA."

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum."

This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees.

In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HiR yields promising results across different instruction following tasks, while requiring less computational budget.

It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results."

    "abstract": "We investigate the phenomenology of 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, $U(1)_X$, by which flavor changing neutral currents are forbidden at tree level. As an important consequence of the spontaneous breaking of both the $U(1)_X$ and electroweak symmetries by electroweak vacuum expectation values, upper limits appear on masses of an additional gauge boson $Z'$ and extra Higgs bosons which are less than the TeV scale. In addition, the standard model (SM) like Higgs boson $h$ and a heavier Higgs boson $H$ mainly decay into a pair of $Z'$ which induces four lepton final states. These new decay modes cannot be suppressed by taking no $Z$-$Z'$ mixing and/or the Higgs alignment limit. We find that the minimum setup of these 2HDMs has been excluded by current data for four lepton searches at LHC. Such severe constraints can, however, be avoided by introducing a pair of vector-like fermions $χ$ which are singlet under the SM symmetry but charged under $U(1)_X$, and can be a candidate of dark matter. Thanks to the existence of $χ$, $Z'$ can mainly decay into $χ\\barχ$ instead of SM leptons. As benchmark models, we consider the $U(1)_H$ and $U(1)_R$ models realized by fixing specific $U(1)_X$ charges, and find regions of parameter space allowed by theoretical and current experimental constraints. We clarify that $m_H \\in [160, 220]$ GeV and $\\tan β\\in [3, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_H$ model, while $m_H \\in [160, 380]$ GeV and $\\tan β\\in [1.6, 4.4]$ are allowed in the $U(1)_R$ model. In both the models, the $Z'$ mass is constrained to be $100~\\text{GeV} \\lesssim m_{Z'} \\lesssim 110$ GeV. Such a quite limited parameter space can further be explored at future collider experiments, e.g., High-Luminosity LHC and lepton colliders."

We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

This paper presents a mobile-efficient SER system based on DistilHuBERT, a distilled and 8-bit quantized transformer that achieves 92% parameter reduction compared to full-scale Wav2Vec 2.0 models while maintaining competitive accuracy. We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness. These findings establish a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, enabling practical affect recognition on resource-constrained mobile devices."

    "abstract": "Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses significant risks to trustworthiness, manifesting primarily as stereotypical biases (e.g., gender or racial stereotypes) and structural biases (e.g., lexical overlap or position preferences). However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities."

    "abstract": "This paper constructs and analyzes a three channel dissipative framework for Warm Higgs Inflation, wherein the total dissipation coefficient, $Υ(h,T)$, is decomposed into low temperature, high temperature, and threshold activated contributions. A genetic algorithm is employed for the global numerical solution and statistical inference of the background field dynamics. To overcome the single channel dominance degeneracy in high dimensional parameter scans, two classes of structural priors are introduced into the objective function: a \\texttt{mixing} prior to suppress extreme channel fractions and an \\texttt{entropy} prior to favor multi channel coexistence. Furthermore, the adoption of a layered warmness criterion (e.g., $Q \\equiv Υ/3H$) decouples model selection from cosmological observables, thereby enhancing analytical transparency. The complete workflow is demonstrated on a $14$ dimensional phenomenological model. An ablation study of the priors (\\texttt{noprior} vs. \\texttt{mixing} vs. \\texttt{mixing+entropy}) yields $18871$ viable parameter points, revealing that the priors significantly enhance the discovery probability of non-trivial multi channel solutions within a parameter space naturally biased towards single channel dominance. After imposing the observational constraint $r < 0.036$, the number of retained solutions for each scenario is $14485$, $1889$, and $1971$, respectively. A typical best fit solution exhibits a \"channel relay\" dynamical feature during its evolution and a genuinely mixed state at the pivot scale (e.g., $f_{{\\rm HT},*}\\simeq 0.399480$, $f_{{\\rm th},*}\\simeq 0.600517$), implying that the microscopic origin of dissipation need not be unique within a single inflationary history."

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning."

Our characterizations involve novel models of Bayesian persuasion, where the principal can steer the agent's bias after acquiring costly information.

It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures."

    "abstract": "Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog."

However, existing evaluations of algorithmic often rely on experiments conducted on a limited number of networks, assuming consistent performance rankings across domains. Despite the significant disparities in generative mechanisms and semantic contexts, previous studies often improperly highlight ``universally optimal\" algorithms based solely on naive average over networks across domains. This paper systematically evaluates 12 mainstream link prediction algorithms across 740 real-world networks spanning seven domains. We present substantial empirical evidence elucidating the performance of algorithms in specific domains. This findings reveal a notably low degree of consistency in inter-domain algorithm rankings, a phenomenon that stands in stark contrast to the high degree of consistency observed within individual domains. Principal Component Analysis shows that response vectors formed by the rankings of the 12 algorithms cluster distinctly by domain in low-dimensional space, thus confirming domain attributes as a pivotal factor affecting algorithm performance. We propose a metric called Winner Score that could identify the superior algorithm in each domain: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for social networks, Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks for economics, Graph Convolutional Networks for chemistry, and L3-based Resource Allocation for biology. However, these domain-specific top-performing algorithms tend to exhibit suboptimal performance in other domains. This finding underscores the importance of aligning an algorithm's mechanism with the network structure."

The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change."

In our work, we introduce a two-layer random hypergraph model, in which hyperedges represent households and workplaces. Within this overlapping, adaptive structure, individuals react if their opinion is in majority in their groups. The process evolves through random steps: individuals can either change their opinion, or quit their workplace and join another one in which their opinion belongs to the majority. Based on computer simulations, our first goal is to describe the effect of the parameters responsible for the probability of changing opinion and quitting workplace on the homophily and speed of polarization. We also analyze the model as a Markov chain, and study the frequency of the absorbing states. Then, we quantitatively compare how different statistical and machine learning methods, in particular, linear regression, xgboost and a convolutional neural network perform for estimating these probabilities, based on partial information from the process, for example, the distribution of opinion configurations within households and workplaces. Among other observations, we conclude that all methods can achieve the best results under appropriate circumstances, and that the amount of information that is necessary to provide good results depends on the strength of the peer pressure effect."

To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM.

[Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $κ_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim \\ell^{2}(λ+2μ)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $κ_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim 2κ$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations."

    "abstract": "We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory."

    "abstract": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists."

Hard partons, propagating through dense matter, scatter off the partonic substructure of the medium, leading to stimulated emission, accompanied by recoiling medium partons. We introduce a simple modification, a multiplicative $(1 + a/T)$ correction to the dispersion relation of quarks and gluons (equivalent to an effective fugacity). This leads to calculated transport coefficients (e.g. $\\hat{q}/T^3$) showing the expected behavior of depreciating at lower temperatures, including within the hot hadronic gas. This simple modification recovers the light-like dispersion relations at high temperatures, and introduces an excess depreciation factor for parton populations at lower temperatures, allowing partonic energy loss and recoil calculations to be extended into the hadronic phase. This modified distribution, in combination with initial state cold nuclear matter effects (shadowing), is used to simultaneously describe the nuclear modification factor and elliptic anisotropy of jets and leading hadrons, over multiple centralities and collision energies."

Our results include polynomial-time solvability for transforming graphs between bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs, as well as for complementing bipartite regular graphs into chordal graphs. We also show that MSC to the class of graphs of fixed degeneracy can be solved in polynomial time when the input graph is a forest. Moreover, we investigate MSC with respect to connectivity and prove that MSC to the class of disconnected graphs and to the class of 2-connected graphs can be solved in polynomial time for arbitrary inputs."

Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters."

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods."

We propose RoboMirror, the first retargeting-free video-to-locomotion framework embodying \"understand before you imitate\". Leveraging VLMs, it distills raw egocentric/third-person videos into visual motion intents, which directly condition a diffusion-based policy to generate physically plausible, semantically aligned locomotion without explicit pose reconstruction or retargeting. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoboMirror, it enables telepresence via egocentric videos, drastically reduces third-person control latency by 80%, and achieves a 3.7% higher task success rate than baselines.

The theory is compactly reviewed, with a special focus on the emergent scale of the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC), which carries the order parameter associated with the qPVC vertex, and an efficient treatment of the nuclear many-body problem organized around the qPVC hierarchy. Self-consistent numerical solutions of the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter-Dyson equation for the nuclear response function in medium-heavy nuclei are discussed. The presented update on the pygmy dipole resonance focuses on establishing the formation of its two-component structure as a result of the fragmentation of the low-energy dipole mode due to the qPVC and its mixing with the similarly fragmented giant dipole resonance. The centroid of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance is also linked to qPVC effects, particularly to its sensitivity to the coupling of the collective breathing mode to the lowest quadrupole vibrations, which is enhanced by quadrupole collectivity. The resolution of the long-standing \"fluffiness\" puzzle regarding the compressibility of open-shell tin isotopes is summarized. The recently developed thermal variant of the superfluid response theory is briefly introduced and continuously linked to the description of the isoscalar monopole response at finite temperature with the prospect of refining the temperature-dependent nuclear equation of state."

Berry phase emerge as a geometric holonomy acquired by the dark states during adiabatic traversal of LG phase defined in a toroidal parameter space.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering."

WAMM applies a multi-phase enhancement pipeline to the SR-BH 2020 dataset that includes large-scale deduplication, LLM-guided relabeling, realistic attack data augmentation, and LLM-based filtering, producing three refined datasets. Four machine and deep learning models are evaluated using a unified feature space built from statistical and text-based representations. Results show that using an augmented and LLM-filtered dataset on the same technology stack, XGBoost reaches 99.59% accuracy with microsecond-level inference while deep learning models degrade under noisy augmentation. When tested against OWASP CRS using an unseen augmented dataset, WAMM achieves true positive block rates between 96 and 100% with improvements of up to 86%.

    "abstract": "The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors."

Our approach is based on choosing a suitable trial solution, i.e. an ansatz, which is the product of the time-dependent amplitude and the oscillatory (trigonometric) function that has the same frequency but different initial phase, compared to the undamped case. We derive the equation for the amplitude decay using the connection of the energy dissipation rate with the power of the total damping force and the approximation that the amplitude changes slowly over time compared to the oscillating part of the ansatz. By matching our ansatz to the initial conditions, we obtain the equations for the corresponding initial amplitude and initial phase. Here we demonstrate the validity of our approach in the case of damping quadratic in velocity, Coulomb damping, and a combination of the two, i.e. in this paper we consider purely nonlinear damping, while the dynamics with combinations of damping linear in velocity and nonlinear damping will be analyzed in a follow-up paper. In the case of damping quadratic in velocity, by comparing our approximate analytical solutions with the corresponding numerical solutions, we find that our solutions excellently describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the regime of weak to moderately strong quadratic damping. In the case of Coulomb damping, as well as in the case of a combined Coulomb and quadratic damping, our approximate analytical solutions agree well with the corresponding numerical solutions until the last few half-periods of the motion. Therefore, for these two cases, we introduce improved variants of our approximate solutions which describe the dynamics well until the very end."

    "abstract": "Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces."

    "abstract": "Dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANSs) serve as a specific astrophysical laboratory for probing the features of dark matter (DM) and have emerged as a promising candidate for interpreting recent astrophysical observations (e.g., by NICER and LIGO/Virgo). Accurately constraining the internal DM content of DANSs is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we construct the equations of state (EoS) for DANS matter by employing twelve nuclear matter (NM) models within the covariant density functional (CDF) theory and a self-interacting fermionic model for DM. Using these EoSs as input, we solve the two-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations to systematically investigate the influence of DM on the global properties of neutron stars (NSs). By incorporating recent observational constraints on NS properties, the maximum DM mass fraction $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}$ in DANSs is determined for each NM EoS model. Our analysis reveals a strong linear correlation (Pearson coefficient $r=0.98$) between $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}$ and the maximum mass of a pure NS, $M_{\\rm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}}$, described by $f_χ^{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.22 M_{\\mathrm{NS}}^{\\mathrm{max}} - 0.44$. Leveraging this correlation and the observed NS maximum mass distribution, $P(M_{\\text{NS}}^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) for the maximum DM mass, $P(M_χ^{\\max} \\mid \\text{EM})$, in DANSs. We find that at the 68\\% confidence level, $M_χ^{\\mathrm{max}}=0.150^{+0.070}_{-0.051}\\ M_{\\odot}$. This quantitative constraint on the DM mass provides a critical prior for interpreting potential observational signatures of DANSs, such as anomalous tidal deformabilities and distinctive gravitational-wave signals."

The MCMC algorithm can be trapped in local modes of the posterior distribution and the choice of post-treatment procedures used on the output of the MCMC algorithm leads to different clustering structures. In this work, we propose improvements of the MCMC algorithms proposed in previous works in order to avoid the local modes of the posterior distribution while reducing the computation time. We also carry out a simulation study to compare the performances of the MCMC algorithms and different post-processing in order to provide guidelines on their use.

We contribute to the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field key considerations and recommendations for designing soft robotic garments, including the potential for kinesic communication, the impact of such technologies on social dynamics, and the importance of ethical guidelines.

    "abstract": "Powerful autonomous systems, which reason, plan, and converse using and between numerous tools and agents, are made possible by Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and new agentic AI systems, like LangChain and GraphChain. Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable. The framework, which expands the concept of provenance tracking and validation to the multi-agent orchestration, enhances the establishment of secure, understandable and reliable agentic AI systems."

    "abstract": "Lock sets are commonly used for dynamic analysis of deadlocks. The standard per-thread lock set construction only considers locks acquired in the same thread, but is unaware of locks acquired in another thread. This leads to false positives and false negatives. The underlying issue is that the commonly used notion of a critical section on which the lock set construction relies ignores events from other threads. We give a trace-based characterization of critical sections that drops this restriction. Critical sections are no longer restricted to a single thread and can cover multiple threads. Such forms of critical sections exist, are natural, and correct the standard formulation. We show how to soundly approximate the trace-based characterization via partial order relations. Thus, we obtain an improved lock set construction that can still be efficiently computed and allows us to remove false positives reported by the DIRK deadlock predictor and remove false negatives by extending the SPDOffline deadlock predictor. We integrate various lock set constructions with increased precision in an extension of SPDOffline. Our extensions remain sound (no false positives) but are more complete (fewer false negatives) w.r.t. SPDOffline. For an extensive standard benchmark suite we can also show that the performance is not affected."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions."

    "abstract": "Gauss--Christoffel quadrature is a fundamental method for numerical integration, and its convergence analysis is closely related to the decay of Chebyshev expansion coefficients. Classical estimates, including those due to Trefethen, are based on weighted bounded variation assumptions involving the singular weight $(1-x^{2})^{-1/2}$, which may be too restrictive for functions with limited regularity at the endpoints. In this paper, we establish a new error bound for Gauss--Christoffel quadrature under weakened regularity assumptions. The analysis relies on a new identity for higher-order derivatives of Chebyshev polynomials. As a consequence, we obtain an improved decay estimate for Chebyshev coefficients, where the classical weighted condition \\[ V_{r}=\\int_{-1}^{1}\\frac{|f^{(r+1)}(x)|}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\\,dx \\] is replaced by the weaker condition \\[ U_{r}=\\int_{-1}^{1}|f^{(r+1)}(x)|\\,dx. \\] This result leads to a corresponding error estimate for the Gauss--Christoffel quadrature rule, which is less restrictive than previous bounds. The approach is also extended to the Gauss--Gegenbauer case. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Economists often define the middle class based on income distribution, yet selecting which segment constitutes the `middle' is essentially arbitrary. This paper proposes a definition of the middle class based solely on the properties of income distribution. It argues that for a collection of unequal societies, the poor and rich extremes of the distribution unambiguously worsen or improve their respective income shares with inequality. In contrast, such an effect is moderated at the center. I define the middle class as the segment of the income distribution whose income shares are insensitive to changes in inequality. This unresponsiveness property allows one to single out, endogenously and with minimal arbitrariness, the location of the middle class. The paper first provides a theoretical argument for the existence of such a group. It then uses detailed percentile data from the World Income Database (WID) to empirically characterize the world middle class: a group skewed toward the upper part of the distribution - comprising much of the affluent population below the very rich - with stable borders over time and across countries. The definition aligns with the prevailing view in political economy of the middle class as as a moderating actor, given their null incentives to engage in distributive conflict."

In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies."

    "abstract": "[Context and Motivation] Global energy consumption has been steadily increasing in recent years, with data centers emerging as major contributors. This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications. [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored. [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed. [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices."

Following the choreographic tradition, AIOCJ ensures by-construction correctness of communications (e.g., no deadlocks) before, during, and after adaptation. Adaptation is dynamic, and the adaptation scenarios need to be fully specified only at runtime. Using AIOCJ to model the Adaptable TeaStore, we showcase the strengths of the approach and its current limitations, providing suggestions for future directions for refining the paradigm (and the AIOCJ language, in particular), to better align it with real-world Cloud architectures."

In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices."

To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm."

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets."

It's found that, except the lightest scalar meson $σ$ whose structure is not well understood so far, the vacuum mass spectra of relevant hadrons and NM properties around saturation density can be well reproduced. Nevertheless, we found that, to have a realistic mass-radius relation of neutron stars, the $πN$ sigma term $σ_{πN}$, which denotes the contribution of explicit symmetry breaking, should deviate from its empirical values at vacuum. Specifically, $σ_{πN}\\sim -600$ MeV, rather than $(32-89) \\rm \\ MeV$ at vacuum. With an appropriate choice of $σ_{πN}$ and $K(n_0)$, our framework can give a more data favored mass-radius relation of neutron stars with the emergence of hyperons. The effect of explicit symmetry breaking at densities is hoped to provide a new insight to the relation between microscopic symmetries in medium and macroscopic phenomena."

    "abstract": "We study how organizations should select among competing AI models when user utility, deployment costs, and compliance requirements jointly matter. Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability -- deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability-cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability-cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice."

    "abstract": "Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases."

Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems."

The resulting probability is mathematically ill-defined and does not determine a tunnelling rate. Apart from this dimensional issue, the assumed initial configuration, a toroidal structure made of long molecules, and its treatment in empty space are inconsistent with soft-matter physics and with the hot, collisional environment expected for prebiotic chemistry. Consequently, the claimed exponential suppression of biogenesis, and the inference that extraterrestrial life is likely absent, are not supported."

Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials."

It was shown by Delsarte that a $t$-design with degree $s$ and $t\\geq 2s-2$ in a Hamming association scheme induces an $s$-class association scheme. We prove that an extremal orthogonal array gives rise to a fission scheme of the latter one, which has $2s-1$ or $2s$ classes. As a corollary, a new necessary condition for the existence of tight orthogonal arrays of strength $3$ is obtained.

The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management."

    "abstract": "In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems."

Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models.

Recognizing the limitations of index-based methods, which become quickly outdated as travel costs change, our work abandons indexes in favor of incremental network expansion on each snapshot of a dynamic road network to search for kNNs. To enhance expansion efficiency, we present DkNN, a distributed algorithm that divides the road network into sub-networks for parallel exploration using Dijkstra's algorithm across relevant regions. This approach effectively addresses challenges related to maintaining global distance accuracy during local, independent subgraph exploration, while minimizing unnecessary searches in irrelevant sub-networks and facilitating the early detection of true kNNs, despite the lack of constant global search monitoring.

    "abstract": "Quantum communication exploits non-classical correlations to achieve efficient and unconditionally secure exchange of information. In particular, the quantum teleportation protocol allows for a deterministic and secure transfer of unknown quantum states by using pre-shared quantum entanglement and classical feedforward communication. Quantum teleportation in the microwave regime provides an important tool for high-fidelity remote quantum operations, enabling distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits and potentially facilitating short-range, open-air microwave quantum communication. In this context, we consider practical application scenarios for the microwave analog quantum teleportation protocol based on continuous-variable states. We theoretically analyze the effect of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities of coherent states and show that these imperfections can be fully corrected by an appropriate feedforward gain. Furthermore, we consider quantum teleportation with finite-size codebooks and derive modified no-cloning thresholds as a function of the codebook configuration. Finally, we analyze the security of quantum teleportation under public channel attacks and demonstrate that the corresponding secure fidelity thresholds may drastically differ from the conventional no-cloning values. Our results contribute to the general development of quantum communication protocols and, in particular, illustrate the feasibility of using quantum teleportation in realistic microwave networks for robust and unconditionally secure communication."

    "abstract": "Filamentary infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are believed to represent the initial conditions for massive star and cluster formation. We investigate the IRDC G035.39-00.33 using SiO, H13CO+, CH3OH, and CS emission observed with ALMA at 3.5\\arcsec\\ resolution (0.05 pc). The SiO emission traces shock activity within the cloud, providing insights into current star formation and cloud formation mechanisms. We identify several regions with broad SiO emission clearly associated with outflows, pinpointing the locations of ongoing star formation across the cloud. The ALMA images also reveal a series of spatially extended SiO emission spots with narrow line profiles, aligned along an arc-like path that is also seen in CS and CH3OH emission. While the broad SiO emission is mainly associated with the main cloud filament, as seen in visual extinction, the narrow SiO arch is located at the edge of the cloud, far from the identified sites of star formation activity. The presence of these arc-like morphologies suggests that large-scale shocks may have compressed the gas in the surroundings of the G035.39-00.33 cloud, shaping its filamentary structure. By inspecting the large-scale radio continuum emission around G035.39-00.33, we find that this IRDC is part of a larger star-forming complex where the densest and coolest material appears at the interacting regions between a Supernova Remnant (SNR) and an expanding HII region. In particular, we hypothesize that this IRDC may be spatially coincident with the ionized expanding gas associated with the previously identified SNR G35.6-0.4. We suggest that collisions between giant molecular clouds and expanding gas flows from interacting SNRs and HII regions may be responsible for the observed arc-like structures. Such shock compressions could play an important role in the formation of IRDCs and in the potential triggering of star formation."

To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \\textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks.

To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \\textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \\textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \\textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis."

However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs.

    "abstract": "The flow properties of fresh concrete are critical in the construction industry, as they directly affect casting quality and the durability of the final structure. Although non-Newtonian fluid models, such as the Bingham model, are widely used to model these flow properties, they often fail to capture key phenomena, including flow stoppage, and frequently rely on non-physical regularization or stabilization techniques to mitigate numerical instabilities at low shear rates. To address these limitations, this study proposes an elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model within the continuum mechanics framework, which treats fresh concrete as a solid-like material with a rate-dependent yield stress. The model inherently captures the transition from elastic response to viscous flow following Bingham rheology, and vice versa, enabling accurate prediction of flow cessation without ad-hoc criteria. Additionally, a thixotropy evolution law is incorporated to account for the time-dependent behavior resulting from physical flocculation and shear-induced deflocculation. The proposed model is implemented within the Material Point Method (MPM), whose Lagrangian formulation facilitates tracking of history-dependent variables and robust simulation of large deformation flows. Numerical examples demonstrate the model's effectiveness in reproducing a range of typical concrete flow scenarios, offering a more physically consistent numerical tool for optimizing concrete construction processes and minimizing defects."

We resort to Galerkin projection to define the semi-discrete reduced-order model and we consider a Radau-IIA IRK method for time integration: the resulting algebraic system is solved using static condensation of the interface degrees of freedom. The reduced-order model preserves a semi-discrete energy balance inherited from the full-order model, and avoids the need for additional interface enrichment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed combination of high-order IRK schemes with bubble-port decoupling of velocity and displacement degrees of freedom yields stable and accurate reduced-order model for long-time integration of strongly-coupled parametric FSI problems."

While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems."

We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\\langle M_{\\rm wind}\\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\\langle M_{\\rm dyn}\\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\\odot}$.

I show that an allocation is PI-rationalizable if and only if its allocation graph is acyclic. Next, I analyse non-PI-rationalizable allocations. First, I study the three respective problems: removal of a minimum size of subset of individuals/types/objects to restore PI-rationalizability. I prove that these three problems are NP-complete. Then, I provide an alternative goodness-of-fit measure, namely Critical Exchange Index (CEI). The CEI assess the highest portion of individuals who can involve exchanging their final objects to reach PI. This measure shows the extent of inefficiencies. The results yield the first complete revealed preference analysis for Pareto efficiency and individual rationality in matching markets and provide an implementable tool for empirical applications."

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation."

However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties."

This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures."

We rigorously classify all the fixed points with $N=4,5$ and do an extensive search for solutions of the beta function equations with $N\\geq6$. In particular, we find non-trivial fixed points with $H=\\mathbb{Z}_{N-1} \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2, \\, S_{M}\\times S_{N-M}$ and rigorously prove that real fixed points with $H=(S_{N/2}\\times S_{N/2})\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$ exist for all even $N\\geq6$.

Utilizing the kinematic behaviour of the free surface boundary, an iterative pseudo-time procedure is proposed to determine the a priori unknown free surface profile. The numerical model is implemented in the open-source finite element framework Firedrake, which enables the use of a high-order polynomial basis on unstructured meshes through weak formulations. Additionally, the curvature of the free surface and submerged bodies is incorporated through curvilinear elements obtained via transfinite linear blending, which conserves the high-order convergent properties of the overall scheme. The model is applied to several benchmark cases in two spatial dimensions. Initially, it addresses fixed-domain problems, including the lid-driven cavity flow and flows around bodies such as a cylinder and a NACA airfoil. Subsequently, with the presence of a free surface, it is extended to determine the flow around a bathymetry bump and a submerged NACA airfoil. The results confirm the high-order accuracy of the model through convergence studies and demonstrate a substantial speed-up over low-order numerical schemes."

When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$."

This map predicts that the dimension of states in these particular sectors doubles as it goes from zero to infinite coupling. We test this prediction against the non-perturbative spectrum of insertions on the Wilson line obtained using integrability. In addition to already available integrability-based results, we obtain the non-perturbative scaling dimension of the simplest non-trivial operator with transverse spin about the Wilson line, thereby extending the Quantum Spectral Curve construction to such charged sectors."

To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience."

Comparisons with previous models by Brouwers and Zaccone demonstrate that our approach provides the most consistent and accurate predictions. The method can be naturally extended to polydisperse mixtures with continuous size distributions, offering a robust framework for understanding the universality of RCP in hard-disk systems."

In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum quench of an anisotropic ferromagnet can be used for Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation based on measurements of the qubit only. In the presence of ground-state squeezing, the protocol yields information about the eigenmode frequency of the coupled magnon-qubit system, whereas no information is gained in the absence of such squeezing. The protocol therefore leverages genuine quantum correlations in the form of magnonic squeezing while simultaneously relying on the equilibrium character of this squeezing -- a feature distinctive to magnetic systems."

Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/"

We test their performance under both standard and 'deceptive' prompt conditions, where the models were instructed to evade detection. Our findings reveal a significant instability: while default AI-generated text was easily identified, all models struggled to correctly classify human-written work (with error rates up to 32%). Furthermore, the models were highly susceptible to deceptive prompts, with Gemini's output completely fooling GPT-4. Given that simple prompt alterations significantly degrade detection efficacy, our results demonstrate that these LLMs are currently too unreliable for making high-stakes academic misconduct judgments."

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia. In addition, we examine various prompting strategies and find that SLMs struggle to follow the required style when the instruction is placed in system messages rather than user messages, which contradicts the intended function of system prompts."

ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI)."

Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts.

Derrick's scaling relation provides a global integral constraint on these profiles, but reveals nothing about the local balance between kinetic and potential contributions in different regions. We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $α$ that controls the radial weighting: negative $α$ emphasizes the core where topological boundary conditions are imposed, large positive $α$ emphasizes the asymptotic tail, and $α= 1$ recovers the classical Derrick relation. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $α$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $α$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $α$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $α$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $α$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales."

    "abstract": "We employ the massive gravity approach to stress-tensor deformations in a variety of scenarios, obtaining novel results and establishing new connections. Starting with perturbation theory, we show that the addition of $\\text{tr} T+Λ_{2}$ to $T\\overline{T}$ can be recovered and we construct the deformed action of an interacting non-abelian spin-1 along with spin-1/2 seed model, extending previous findings. As a result, a set of algebraic properties for certain hypergeometric functions is derived, allowing us to initiate the algebraic study of special functions directly via stress-tensor deformations and massive gravity. Moreover, we sharpen the connection between the trace-flow equation and the local renormalization group in any dimension. In $d>2$, the usual initial condition for the coupling leads to a potential known as ghost-free, minimal massive gravity. Upon expansion around the reference background, we retrieve Fierz-Pauli at leading order, matching the random geometry and holographic approaches. At the same time, we demonstrate that a change of coordinates interpretation is possible for the corresponding operator, which we verify with a simple example. Finally, we study the family of $(\\text{tr} T)^{n}$ deformations advancing earlier work, and illustrate how the massive gravity description of non-linear electrodynamics can be incorporated in our framework."

We pursue a methodology for computing the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure of $x + i y$, which relies on the matrix-valued subordination function $Ω$ of the Hermitization of $x + i y$, and on the fact that $Ω$ has an explicitly described left inverse $H$. Our main point is that the Brown measure of $x + i y$ becomes more approachable when it is reparametrized via a certain change of variable $h : \\mathcal{D} \\to \\mathcal{M}$, with $\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{M}$ open subsets of $\\mathbb{C}$, where $\\mathcal{D}$ and $h$ are defined in terms of the aforementioned left inverse $H$, and $\\mathrm{cl} \\,(\\mathcal{M})$ contains the support of the Brown measure.

The goal is to determine which edge, if any, is not working in the network using the smallest number of measurements. We prove rigorous upper and lower bounds on this optimal number of measurements for different classes of graphs. These bounds are tight for several of these classes showing that our measurement strategies are optimal."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, leading to their adoption in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and scientific research. However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models. These results demonstrate MATP's potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated reasoning."

    "abstract": "Today's heavy-duty mobile machines (HDMMs) face two transitions: from diesel-hydraulic actuation to clean electric systems driven by climate goals, and from human supervision toward greater autonomy. Diesel-hydraulic systems have long dominated, so full electrification, via direct replacement or redesign, raises major technical and economic challenges. Although advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could enable higher autonomy, adoption in HDMMs is limited by strict safety requirements, and these machines still rely heavily on human supervision. This dissertation develops a control framework that (1) simplifies control design for electrified HDMMs through a generic modular approach that is energy-source independent and supports future modifications, and (2) defines hierarchical control policies that partially integrate AI while guaranteeing safety-defined performance and stability. Five research questions align with three lines of investigation: a generic robust control strategy for multi-body HDMMs with strong stability across actuation types and energy sources; control solutions that keep strict performance under uncertainty and faults while balancing robustness and responsiveness; and methods to interpret and trust black-box learning strategies so they can be integrated stably and verified against international safety standards. The framework is validated in three case studies spanning different actuators and conditions, covering heavy-duty mobile robots and robotic manipulators. Results appear in five peer-reviewed publications and one unpublished manuscript, advancing nonlinear control and robotics and supporting both transitions."

It allows the description of applications in the form of functional blocks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents how an existing framework for offline performance optimization can be applied to microservice applications during the Release phase of the DevOps life cycle. Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible. If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening."

A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance."

In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching Δ system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free Δ-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms."

    "abstract": "Within the context of human-robot interaction (HRI), Theory of Mind (ToM) is intended to serve as a user-friendly backend to the interface of robotic systems, enabling robots to infer and respond to human mental states. When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective."

In this work, we address this challenge by extending Patchwork Kriging into the causal inference framework. Our proposed method partitions the data according to the estimated propensity score and applies Patchwork Kriging to enforce continuity of HTE estimates across adjacent regions. By imposing continuity constraints only along the propensity score dimension, rather than the full covariate space, the proposed approach substantially reduces computational cost while avoiding discontinuities inherent in simple local approximations. The resulting method can be interpreted as a smoothing extension of stratification and provides an efficient approach to HTE estimation. The proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data application."

We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves >0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a >400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms."

However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

Based on the general form of the wave functions of multimode Gaussian states, we propose a universal scheme for SFS generation. For this scheme, we evaluate the probability of SFS generation and analyze the robustness of the process against imperfections in particle-number-resolving detectors. In addition, we compare the universal scheme with a nonuniversal scheme, in which the generation of SFSs depends on a specific distribution of particle numbers across the detectors.

This method adds copies of some of the random variables in generations. A significant reduction in computational complexity, achieved through theoretical considerations and by harnessing the inherent symmetries, allowed us to calculate all five-variable non-Shannon inequalities provided by the first nine generations. Based on the results, we define two infinite collections of such inequalities, and prove them to be entropy inequalities.

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners.

We argue that CP is best understood as a rank-calibrated descendant of the Fisher-Dempster-Hill fiducial/direct-probability tradition rather than as Bayesian conditioning in disguise. We establish four separations from coherent countably additive predictive semantics. First, canonical conformal constructions violate conditional extensionality: prediction sets can depend on the marginal design P(X) even when P(Y|X) is fixed. Second, any finitely additive sequential extension preserving rank calibration is nonconglomerable, implying countable Dutch-book vulnerabilities. Third, rank-calibrated updates cannot be realized as regular conditionals of any countably additive exchangeable law on Y^infty. Fourth, formalizing both paradigms as families of one-step predictive kernels, conformal and Bayesian kernels coincide only on a Baire-meagre subset of the space of predictive laws. We further show that rank- and proxy-based reductions are generically Blackwell-deficient relative to full-data experiments, yielding positive Le Cam deficiency for suitable losses. Extending the analysis to prediction-powered inference (PPI) yields an analogous message: bias-corrected, proxy-rectified estimators can be valid as confidence devices while failing to define transportable belief states across stages, shifts, or adaptive selection. Together, the results sharpen a general limitation of wrappers: finite-sample calibration guarantees do not by themselves supply composable semantics for sequential updating or downstream decision-making."

    "abstract": "An analysis of the general concept of volume variation partition of a porous body is presented, introducing the breathing coefficient, defined as the ratio of two volume variations. Considering a total volume of a porous body, composed of solid volume and ``void'' volume, this ratio can be used to evaluate the distribution of a volume variation into both others. A full description of its physical interpretation is detailed, together with an uncertainty analysis that specifies precautions about its use. As an example of application, a case study of 2D monosized disc packing swelling is developed. The analytical model reveals the presence of minimisation points of the breathing coefficient dependent on the initial granular organisation, showing possible ways to minimise the breathing of a granular material."

We first develop a functional-analytic framework suited to variational problems on open books and establish the existence of solutions as constrained action minimizers. For graph-based open books (i.e., those isomorphic to the product of a graph with an interval) we prove the existence of a sharp transition in the dimensionality of ground states. Specifically, there exists a critical transverse width: below this threshold, all ground states coincide with the ground states on the underlying graph trivially extended in the transverse direction; above it, ground states become genuinely two-dimensional."

We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis."

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can effectively shape the wireless propagation to match the environment and improve communication performance. However, in conventional RSMA-RIS architectures, the antenna elements are fixed, which underutilizes spatial degrees of freedom and hence constrains system performance. To address this limitation, we propose a movable-antenna (MA) assisted RSMA-RIS framework and formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming matrix, the RIS reflection matrix, the common-rate partition, and the MA positions. The original problem is equivalently transformed by employing the fractional programming (FP) method, and a closed-form solution for the common rate splitting is derived. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we obtain iterative updates for the Lagrange multipliers together with a closed-form expression for the beamforming matrix. We then develop an update rule for the RIS reflection matrix via the dual problem, and finally determine the optimal antenna locations using a gradient-ascent procedure. Numerical results indicate that, even in the presence of RIS assistance, incorporating MAs yields additional performance improvements for RSMA. Moreover, relative to space-division multiple access (SDMA), the assistance of MA yields a greater performance gain for RSMA."

Extending the framework of [7,8] from rectangular to triangular meshes, we introduce three procedures for constructing high-degree Frenet-IFE spaces: an initial construction based on monomial bases, a generalized construction using orthogonal polynomials, and reconstruction methods aimed at improving the conditioning of the associated mass matrix. The optimal approximation capability of the proposed IFE spaces is demonstrated through numerical examples. We further incorporate these spaces into interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods for elliptic interface problems and observe optimal convergence rates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms."

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware."

    "abstract": "Graph federated learning enables the collaborative extraction of high-order information from distributed subgraphs while preserving the privacy of raw data. However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness."

We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts."

This limitation can be alleviated by introducing a dimension-5 Higgs-portal operator in the minimal renormalizable complex scalar DM model and/or by modifying the standard cosmological history of the Universe. In this article, we analyze complex scalar DM production in both the reheating and radiation-dominated epochs within an effective field theory (EFT) framework. While both scenarios exhibit sizeable regions of parameter space consistent with existing constraints, freeze-out during reheating opens up additional viable regions that are otherwise ruled out by DM overabundance in the radiation-dominated scenario. Notably, the renormalizable Higgs-portal coupling is constrained by relic density, direct- and indirect-detection limits, whereas the EFT coupling associated with the dimension-5 operator is constrained by relic density and indirect-detection bounds arising from DM semi-annihilation. We further study the production cross section of complex scalar DM at hadron and lepton colliders."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP)."

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios."

    "abstract": "Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome."

The main difficulty comes from the nonsmooth nature of logarithmic nonlinearity, which introduces some challenges to the variational framework. In particular, the corresponding energy functional is not of class $C^1$ on $H^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$, which prevents the direct application of standard critical point theory for $C^1$ functional or any reduction methods for $C^{1+σ}$ nonlinearity.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper appears to be the first successful application of the localized variational method to nonsmooth functionals."

The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches."

To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method."

In this paper, we establish an index formula for hemispheres of convex closed surfaces under $C^2$-regularity. The proof is based on studying a vertical section of the null hypersurfaces in Lorentz--Minkowski $4$-space associated with the originally given convex surface. As a consequence, the conjecture is affirmatively solved in the $C^2$-case."

This research aims to apply a machine learning-assisted algorithm to automatically identify the vocal cords and distinguish normal vocal cord images from vocal cord paralysis (VCP). Methods: VCUS videos were acquired from 30 volunteers, which were split into still frames and cropped to a uniform size. Healthy and simulated VCP images were used as training data for vocal cord segmentation and VCP classification models. Results: The vocal cord segmentation model achieved a validation accuracy of 96%, while the best classification model (VIPRnet) achieved a validation accuracy of 99%. Conclusion: Machine learning-assisted analysis of VCUS shows great promise in improving diagnostic accuracy over operator-dependent human interpretation."

The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work."

    "abstract": "Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the \"right to be forgotten.\" While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead."

    "abstract": "In robotics, it is common to check whether a given robot state results in self-intersection (i.e., a self-collision query) or to assess its distance from such an intersection (i.e., a self-proximity query). These checks are typically performed between pairs of shapes attached to different robot links. However, many of these shape pairs can be excluded in advance, as their configurations are known to always or never result in contact. This information is typically encoded in a self-collision matrix, where each entry (i, j) indicates whether a check should be performed between shape i and shape j. While the MoveIt Setup Assistant is widely used to generate such matrices, current tools are limited by static visualization, lack of proximity support, rigid single-geometry assumptions, and tedious refinement workflows, hindering flexibility and reuse in downstream robotics applications. In this work, we introduce an interactive tool that overcomes these limitations by generating and visualizing self-collision matrices across multiple shape representations, enabling dynamic inspection, filtering, and refinement of shape pairs. Outputs are provided in both JSON and YAML for easy integration. The system is implemented in Rust and uses the Bevy game engine to deliver high-quality visualizations. We demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple robot platforms, showing that matrices generated using diverse shape types yield faster and more accurate self-collision and self-proximity queries."

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction."

    "abstract": "Although there exists a clear and, in principle, exact theoretical formulation for the equation of motion for the response of a correlated fermionic system, its numerical implementations for atomic nuclei require feasible approximations. One of the widely accepted approximations is a truncated harmonic oscillator (HO) basis, whose wave functions are used to expand the solutions obtained with realistic interactions. In this work, we extend previously employed HO basis truncated at $N_F$ = 20 fermionic shells to $N_F$ = 50 and perform a systematic study of the effects of such basis increase on nuclear resonances. The relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) and its extension by the particle-vibration coupling dubbed as relativistic time-blocking approximation (RTBA) are applied to the description of the monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and octupole resonances in $^{48}$Ca, $^{78}$Ni, and $^{132}$Sn, and the RRPA studies are extended to $^{70}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. A considerable sensitivity of the strength distributions to the HO basis size is found, especially for low-spin resonances in the light neutron-rich nuclei. The effects of the HO basis extension to $N_F$ = 50 are analyzed and linked to the involvement of proton and neutron continuum states and proton quasi-bound states in the strength formation. The obtained results point to the importance of the HO basis completeness and continuum effects in the nuclear response calculations and evaluation of the associated parameters of the nuclear equation of state. In addition, statistical errors in the RRPA strength functions, which emerge from the details of the fitting protocol of the covariant energy density functional employed, are analyzed. It turns out that they are quite substantial for the monopole response, but significantly smaller for the dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones."

Our lower bounds are higher than the currently fastest algorithms that rely on algebra and give evidence that these algebraic aspects are unavoidable for competitive worst case running times. Specifically, we study input graphs with a small width parameter such as treewidth and pathwidth and show that for any $k$ there exists a graph $G$ of pathwidth at most $k$ and $k^{O(1)}$ vertices such that any tropical circuit calculating the optimal value of a Traveling Salesperson round tour uses at least $2^{Ω(k \\log \\log k)}$ gates. We establish this result by linking tropical circuit complexity to the nondeterministic communication complexity of specific compatibility matrices. These matrices encode whether two partial solutions combine into a full solution, and Raz and Spieker [Combinatorica 1995] previously proved a lower bound for this complexity measure."

A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems."

For bounded-variance noise, we establish mean-square error rates that explicitly quantify the dependence on sample size $n$, noise level $σ$, and smoothness index $m$; under sub-Gaussian noise, we strengthen these to exponential concentration bounds. The analysis yields an explicit a priori and a posteriori rule for the regularization parameter.

By varying the beam wavelength, polarization, and cone angle, several experimentally relevant regimes of angular momentum transfer are identified. In the extreme nonparaxial regime, the absorbed angular momentum displays a staircase-like dependence on the object size, which can be interpreted as a geometric Hall-type response of the twisted field. The results suggest potential applications for controlled angular momentum transfer and size-sensitive probing of absorbing objects."

Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media.

Nonlinear games are solved via nonlinear least-squares formulations, relying on JAX for automatic differentiation. Linear-quadratic GNEs are reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of multiple equilibria. The framework also supports inverse-game and Stackelberg game-design problems.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of s-reachability, where two vertices are s-reachable if there exists a sequence of hyperedges (i.e., a walk) connecting them, such that each pair of consecutive hyperedges shares at least s vertices. Moreover, we define the max-reachability query as a generalized form of the s-reachability problem, which aims to find the largest value of s that allows one vertex to reach another. To answer max-reachability queries in hypergraphs, we first analyze limitations of the existing vertex-to-vertex and hyperedge-to-hyperedge indexing techniques. We then introduce the HL-index, a compact vertex-to-hyperedge index tailored for the max-reachability problem. To both efficiently and effectively construct a minimal HL-index, we develop a fast covering relationship detection method to eliminate fruitless hypergraph traversals during index construction. A lightweight neighbor-index is further proposed to avoid repeatedly exploring neighbor relationships in hypergraphs and hence accelerate the construction. Extensive experiments on 20 datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach."

The solutions have been found in the framework of the Satisfiability Problem in Propositional Logic (SAT).

Motivated by recent detections of $\\sim 100~$TeV photons from Cygnus~X-1 and $\\sim~$PeV photons from Cygnus~X-3 by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), we employ the Astrophysical Multimessenger Emission Simulator (AMES) to model their multimessenger emission considering compact outflow regions as cosmic-ray accelerators, spanning from radio to ultra-high-energy gamma rays. Our results show that the observed $>$TeV gamma rays can originate from either $pγ$ or $pp$ interactions, depending on the location and physical conditions of the emission region, while also reproducing the lower-energy spectra. The different configurations yield unique, observationally testable predictions. In the $0.1-10$~TeV energy range, where current observations provide only upper limits, they predict either a deep dip, a mild suppression, or a power-law spectrum. Additionally, models involving AU-scale blob regions predict strong variability, while those invoking more extended and static external zones show more stable behavior. We also provide a possible qualitative explanation for the distinct modulation patterns across different energy bands, which relies primarily on changes in the Doppler factor and external $γγ$ absorption. Finally, our neutrino predictions, which properly account for muon and pion cooling effects, reveal a significantly suppressed flux, indicating that detecting these sources may be more challenging than previously anticipated."

In this paper, we present FOLHyper, a tool that can automatically check satisfiability of hyperproperties specified in the temporal logic HyperLTL. FOLHyper reduces the problem to an equisatisfiable first-order logic (FOL) formula, which allows us to leverage FOL solvers for the analysis of hyperproperties. As such, FOLHyper is applicable to many formulas beyond the decidable $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ fragment of HyperLTL.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have accelerated inverse-kinematics (IK) inference to the point where low cost manipulators can execute complex trajectories in real time, yet the opaque nature of these models contradicts the transparency and safety requirements emerging in responsible AI regulation. This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards."

    "abstract": "Cepheids are fundamental distance indicators, playing a crucial role not only in the cosmic distance ladder but also in mapping the structure, kinematics, and extinction properties of the Milky Way. Using high-precision photometry and parallaxes from $Gaia$, we identify a significant anti-correlation between the $G$-band extinction coefficient and reddening for Galactic Cepheids, quantified as $R_G = 1.921 \\pm 0.060 - (0.107 \\pm 0.022)\\,E(G_{\\mathrm{BP}} - G_{\\mathrm{RP}})$. We propose that this anti-correlation is partly driven by the pronounced non-linear effects inherent to the broad $Gaia$ bands, while the remaining part arise from the $R_V$ variations caused by diverse interstellar medium. Adopting a fixed $R_G$ would not only lead to an overestimation of the metallicity dependence of Cepheid luminosities, but also systematically underestimate the distances to highly reddened Cepheids. Moreover, the strong reddening dependence of $R_G$ makes Wesenheit function based on it unsuitable for highly reddened Cepheids, since the definition of Wesenheit magnitudes requires a fixed extinction coefficient. In contrast, infrared-based distances, being less affected by non-linear effects and insensitive to $R_V$, provide the most reliable Cepheid distances at present. This work emphasizes the importance of accurately determining $R_V$ for Galactic Cepheids and accounting for non-linear effects in distance measurements, particularly in the optical bands."

In this work we investigate for the first time the $γγ\\to J/ψ+γ(J/ψ)$ channels in Pb-Pb UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by integrating the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization approach with the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) photon distributions.

These azimuthal-dependent observables, defined as the ratios of weighted to unweighted cross sections, are expected to be stable against including the higher-order radiative corrections and varying nonperturbative NRQCD matrix elements, thus offering a fresh test of quarkonium production mechanism and the photon TMD structure in the ultrarelativistic limit."

Due to $P$'s singular behavior this simple criterion is impractical to use. Recent work [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] presented a general, sensitive, and noise-tolerant certification functional, $ξ_{P}$, for the detection of non-classical behavior of quantum states $P_ρ$. There, it was shown that when this functional takes on negative values somewhere in phase space, $ξ_{P}(x,p) < 0$, this is \\emph{sufficient} to certify the nonclassicality of a state. Here we give examples where this certification fails. We investigate states which are known to be nonclassical but the certification functions is positive $ξ(x,p) \\geq 0$ everywhere in phase space. We generalize $ξ$ giving it an appealing form which allows for improved certification. This way we generate the best family of certification functions available so far. Yet, they also fail for very weakly nonclassical states, in other words, the question how to faithfully certify quantumness remains an open question."

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification."

For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place."

Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph."

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bosons in binary black hole systems. In particular, we focus on boson mass transfer in unequal-mass binary black hole systems with arbitrary spin-orientation of the companion. Our results show that the mass ratio between the companion and the primary black holes significantly affects cloud absorption through mass transfer.

They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal."

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available."

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage."

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics.

The confinement of cold energetic electrons produced near the hollow cathode plays a crucial role in guiding the plasma along the device axis. Experimental diagnostics reveal a high concentration of energetic electrons in the peripheral region near the source, which progressively converge toward the axis at a downstream location approximately 3.0 meters from the cathode. The length of the plasma column exhibits an inverse relationship with the electron-neutral collision frequency, indicating the significance of collisional damping in the propagation of energetic electrons. These observations are further supported by fluid simulations performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, which qualitatively reproduce the experimental trends. The results are consistent with a theoretical model previously proposed by the authors, reinforcing the understanding of energetic electron behaviour in magnetically guided plasma columns."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings."

    "abstract": "In todays scenario, various organizations store their sensitive data in the cloud environment. Multiple problems are present while retrieving and storing vast amounts of data, such as the frequency of data requests (increasing the computational overhead of the server) and data leakage while storing. To cope with said problem, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is one of the potential security and access control techniques for secure data storage and authorization. The proposed work divides into two objectives: (i) provide access to authorized users and (ii) secure data storage in a cloud environment. The improved ABE using Functional Based Stream Cipher (FBSE) is proposed for data storage. The proposed technique uses simple scalar points over a parabolic curve to provide multiparty authorization. The authorization points are generated and share only with the authorized recipients. The Shamir secret sharing technique generate the authorization points and 2D-Lagrange Interpolation is used to reconstruct the secret points from regular parabola. The proposed scheme has specified the threshold (Ts>3) legally authorized users to reconstruct the attribute-associated keys for decryption. The encryption of data is evaluated using Statistical analysis (NIST Statistical Test Suite, Correlation Coefficient, and Histogram) test to investigate image pixel deviation. The parameters like encryption and decryption are used for performance analysis, where an increase in the number of attributes for the authorization policy will increase the encryption time. The proposed scheme imposes minimal storage overhead, irrespective of the users identity. The security analysis evidence that it resists collision attacks. The security and performance analysis results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more robust and secure."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they exhibit systematic errors on complex, multi-step programming tasks. We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research."

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins applications in science and engineering, ranging from logistics to electronic design automation. A classic example is the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Finding exact solutions for large-scale TSP instances remains computationally intractable; on von Neumann architectures, such solvers are constrained by the memory wall, incurring compute-memory traffic that grows with instance size. Metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing implemented on compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures, offer a way to mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. This is accomplished by performing in-memory optimization cycles to rapidly find approximate solutions for TSP instances. Yet this approach suffers from degrading solution quality as instance size increases, owing to inefficient state-space exploration. To address this, we present LIMO, a mixed-signal computational macro that implements an in-memory annealing algorithm with reduced search-space complexity. The annealing process is aided by the stochastic switching of spin-transfer-torque magnetic-tunnel-junctions (STT-MTJs) to escape local minima. For large instances, our macro co-design is complemented by a refinement-based divide-and-conquer algorithm amenable to parallel optimization in a spatial architecture. Consequently, our system comprising several LIMO macros achieves superior solution quality and faster time-to-solution on instances up to 85,900 cities compared to prior hardware annealers. The modularity of our annealing peripherals allows the LIMO macro to be reused for other applications, such as vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). This enables our architecture to support neural network inference. As an illustration, we show image classification and face detection with software-comparable accuracy, while achieving lower latency and energy consumption than baseline CiM architectures."

By tracing the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, we establish a quantitative link between carrier density and lattice deformation in layered black phosphorus and germanium selenides. The structural response exhibits significant anisotropy, featuring lattice expansion along the armchair direction and contraction along the zigzag direction, which is attributed to the interplay between charge redistribution and intrinsic lattice anisotropy. Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling. These results provide microscopic insight into the origin of anisotropic photostriction in low-dimensional systems and lay the groundwork for light-controllable, directionally sensitive optomechanical devices at the atomic scale."

    "abstract": "Obtaining high-precision guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds remains difficult, even though the standard high-order conforming finite element (FEM) easily yields extremely sharp upper bounds. Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes. These results confirm that the proposed approach provides a practical and competitive solution to the long-standing difficulty of obtaining sharp, reliable lower eigenvalue bounds."

    "abstract": "Therapeutic peptides have emerged as a pivotal modality in modern drug discovery, occupying a chemically and topologically rich space. While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models."

Adopting a structured \"grounding-reasoning-conclusion\" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \\mathcal{F}_Q \\sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\\mathcal{F}_Q \\sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology."

While large scale vision language action (VLA) models have shown impressive generalization in household and industrial manipulation by leveraging paired video action data from diverse domains, surgical robotics suffers from the paucity of datasets that include both visual observations and accurate robot kinematics. In contrast, vast corpora of surgical videos exist, but they lack corresponding action labels, preventing direct application of imitation learning or VLA training. In this work, we aim to alleviate this problem by learning policy models from SurgWorld, a world model designed for surgical physical AI. We curated the Surgical Action Text Alignment (SATA) dataset with detailed action description specifically for surgical robots. Then we built SurgeWorld based on the most advanced physical AI world model and SATA. It's able to generate diverse, generalizable and realistic surgery videos. We are also the first to use an inverse dynamics model to infer pseudokinematics from synthetic surgical videos, producing synthetic paired video action data. We demonstrate that a surgical VLA policy trained with these augmented data significantly outperforms models trained only on real demonstrations on a real surgical robot platform. Our approach offers a scalable path toward autonomous surgical skill acquisition by leveraging the abundance of unlabeled surgical video and generative world modeling, thus opening the door to generalizable and data efficient surgical robot policies."

Using our framework, we present an edge-based sampling approach for testing properties pertaining to hubs in large graphs. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemerédi regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a small number of edges from a large graph approximately preserves its quotients. Finally, we observe that the random quotients of a graph are related to each other by equipartitions, and we conclude with a characterization of such random graph models."

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec."

However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction."

By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving. Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \\textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments. The results offer valuable implications for enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of autonomous vehicles through rigorous testing methodologies."

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is essential for scientific analysis, as it allows for the evaluation and interpretation of variability and reliability in complex systems and datasets. In their original form, multivariate statistical regression models (partial least-squares regression, PLS, principal component regression, PCR) along with their kernelized versions (kernel partial least-squares regression, K-PLS, kernel principal component regression, K-PCR), do not incorporate uncertainty quantification as part of their output. In this study, we propose a method inspired by conformal inference to estimate and calibrate the uncertainty of multivariate statistical models. The result of this method is a point prediction accompanied by prediction intervals that depend on the input data. We tested the proposed method on both traditional and kernelized versions of PLS and PCR. The method is demonstrated using synthetic data, as well as laboratory near-infrared (NIR) and airborne hyperspectral regression models for estimating functional plant traits. The model was able to successfully identify the uncertain regions in the simulated data and match the magnitude of the uncertainty. In real-case scenarios, the optimised model was not overconfident nor underconfident when estimating from test data: for example, for a 95% prediction interval, 95% of the true observations were inside the prediction interval."

In the joint prediction task involving four sequential conditions--curing and cooling, storage, overloading, and ignition--GrainGNet reduces the mean squared error by 62.8% compared to the baseline graph U-Net model, with only a 5.2% increase in parameter count and an approximately sevenfold improvement in training efficiency. Furthermore, in the high-strain regions of debonding seams, the prediction error is further reduced by 33% compared to the second-best method, offering a computationally efficient and high-fidelity approach to evaluate motor structural safety."

In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases."

This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm."

    "abstract": "Modern CPUs are black boxes, proprietary, and increasingly characterized by sophisticated microarchitectural flaws that evade traditional analysis. While some of these critical vulnerabilities have been uncovered through cumbersome manual effort, building an automated and systematic vulnerability detection framework for real-world post-silicon processors remains a challenge. In this paper, we present Fuzzilicon, the first post-silicon fuzzing framework for real-world x86 CPUs that brings deep introspection into the microcode and microarchitectural layers. Fuzzilicon automates the discovery of vulnerabilities that were previously only detectable through extensive manual reverse engineering, and bridges the visibility gap by introducing microcode-level instrumentation. At the core of Fuzzilicon is a novel technique for extracting feedback directly from the processor's microarchitecture, enabled by reverse-engineering Intel's proprietary microcode update interface. We develop a minimally intrusive instrumentation method and integrate it with a hypervisor-based fuzzing harness to enable precise, feedback-guided input generation, without access to Register Transfer Level (RTL). Applied to Intel's Goldmont microarchitecture, Fuzzilicon introduces 5 significant findings, including two previously unknown microcode-level speculative-execution vulnerabilities. Besides, the Fuzzilicon framework automatically rediscover the $μ$Spectre class of vulnerabilities, which were detected manually in the previous work. Fuzzilicon reduces coverage collection overhead by up to 31$\\times$ compared to baseline techniques and achieves 16.27% unique microcode coverage of hookable locations, the first empirical baseline of its kind. As a practical, coverage-guided, and scalable approach to post-silicon fuzzing, Fuzzilicon establishes a new foundation to automate the discovery of complex CPU vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697).

In contrast, at low-frequency {\\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL."

We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference."

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a methodology that aims to solve physical systems by directly embedding PDE constraints into the neural network training process. In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency. This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed. In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative."

    "abstract": "Intrinsic Gaussian fields are used in many areas of statistics as models for spatial or spatio-temporal dependence, or as priors for latent variables. However, there are two major gaps in the literature: first, the number and flexibility of existing intrinsic models are very limited; second, theory, fast inference, and software are currently underdeveloped for intrinsic fields. We tackle these challenges by introducing the new flexible class of intrinsic Whittle--Matérn Gaussian random fields obtained as the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). Exploiting sparsity resulting from finite-element approximations, we develop fast estimation and simulation methods for these models. We demonstrate the benefits of this intrinsic SPDE approach for the important task of kriging under extrapolation settings. Leveraging the connection of intrinsic fields to spatial extreme value processes, we translate our theory to an SPDE approach for Brown--Resnick processes for sparse modeling of spatial extreme events. This new paradigm paves the way for efficient inference in unprecedented dimensions. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our new methodology, we apply it in two very different areas: a longitudinal study of renal function data, and the modeling of marine heat waves using high-resolution sea surface temperature data."

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique leveraging analog transmission enables the aggregation of local updates directly over-the-air by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multiple-access channel, thereby drastically reducing the communication bottleneck issues of FL compared with digital transmission schemes. This work points out that existing AirComp-FL overlooks a key practical constraint, the instantaneous peak-power constraints imposed by the non-linearity of radiofrequency power amplifiers. We present and analyze the effect of the classic method to deal with this issue, amplitude clipping combined with filtering. We investigate the effect of instantaneous peak-power constraints in AirComp-FL for both single-carrier and multi-carrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We highlight the specificity of AirComp-FL: the samples depend on the gradient value distribution, leading to a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than that observed for uniformly distributed signals. Simulation results demonstrate that, in practical settings, the instantaneous transmit power regularly exceeds the power-amplifier limit; however, by applying clipping and filtering, the FL performance can be degraded. The degradation becomes pronounced especially in multi-carrier OFDM systems due to the in-band distortions caused by clipping and filtering."

    "abstract": "Velocity model building serves as a crucial component for achieving high precision subsurface imaging. However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach."

In this paper, we present experimental studies that show the influence of $J$ on the jet breakup mechanism, shock structures, and unsteady interactions for each $AR$. A wide range of $J$ values (1.5 to 9.7) and three $AR$ cases (0.3, 1, and 3.3) are chosen for the study. We find that in the case of lower $J$, the jet exhibits large unsteadiness, with larger wavelength Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) waves on the windward surface. In contrast, as the $J$ increases, the unsteadiness decreases, smaller and more regular RT wavelength is formed due to the enhanced drag resulting from the reduced jet deflection. However, irrespective of $J$, in the case of $AR$ = 0.3 and 1, the primary atomization mechanism is due to the formation of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on the lateral surfaces. Furthermore, in the case of lower $J$, the shock waves formed upstream of the jet are highly corrugated with significant variations in time. The intense interaction of the liquid jet with the oncoming boundary layer streaks, in the case of lower $J$, is the primary source of large-scale unsteadiness. These findings highlight the significance of $J$ on the atomization mechanism in supersonic cross-flow."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs."

A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing.

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks."

We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability."

    "abstract": "We introduce Galaxy Zoo Evo, a labeled dataset for building and evaluating foundation models on images of galaxies. GZ Evo includes 104M crowdsourced labels for 823k images from four telescopes. Each image is labeled with a series of fine-grained questions and answers (e.g. \"featured galaxy, two spiral arms, tightly wound, merging with another galaxy\"). These detailed labels are useful for pretraining or finetuning. We also include four smaller sets of labels (167k galaxies in total) for downstream tasks of specific interest to astronomers, including finding strong lenses and describing galaxies from the new space telescope Euclid. We hope GZ Evo will serve as a real-world benchmark for computer vision topics such as domain adaption (from terrestrial to astronomical, or between telescopes) or learning under uncertainty from crowdsourced labels. We also hope it will support a new generation of foundation models for astronomy; such models will be critical to future astronomers seeking to better understand our universe."

However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is injected with semantically equivalent instructions in four different languages and reviewed using an LLM. We find that prompt injection induces substantial changes in review scores and accept/reject decisions for English, Japanese, and Chinese injections, while Arabic injections produce little to no effect. These results highlight the susceptibility of LLM-based reviewing systems to document-level prompt injection and reveal notable differences in vulnerability across languages."

We present results from the first systematic power-flow and impurity-content study for the ITER 15 MA baseline scenario constrained directly by existing SOLPS-ITER neon-seeded divertor solutions. Using the OMFIT STEP workflow, stationary temperature and density profiles are predicted with TGYRO for $1.5 \\le Z_{\\rm eff} \\le 2.5$, and the corresponding power crossing the separatrix $P_{\\rm sep}$ is evaluated. We find that $P_{\\rm sep}$ varies by more than a factor of 1.7 across this scan and matches the $\\sim 100$~MW SOLPS-ITER prediction when $Z_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 1.6$ or when auxiliary heating is reduced to $\\sim 75\\%$ of nominal. Rotation-sensitivity studies show that plausible variations in toroidal flow magnitude modify $P_{\\rm sep}$ by $\\lesssim 20\\%$, while AURORA modeling confirms that charge-exchange radiation inside the separatrix is dynamically negligible under predicted ITER neutral densities. These results identify a restricted compatibility window, $Z_{\\rm eff} \\approx 1.6$--1.75 and $0.75 \\lesssim f_{P_{\\rm aux}} \\le 1.0$, in which core transport predictions remain aligned with neon-seeded divertor protection targets.

However, Min Coloring and k-Coloring are easy on both families because they are 2-colorable and 3-colorable, respectively. We show that Min Coloring is NP-hard on the class $\\mathcal T_3$ of graphs of twin-width at most 3. This is the first hardness result on $\\mathcal T_3$ for a problem that is easy on cographs (twin-width 0), on trees (whose twin-width is at most 2), and on unit circular-arc graphs (whose twin-width is at most 3). We also show that for every $k \\geqslant 3$, k-Coloring is NP-hard on $\\mathcal T_4$. We finally make two observations: (1) there are currently very few problems known to be in P on $\\mathcal T_d$ (graphs of twin-width at most $d$) and NP-hard on $\\mathcal T_{d+1}$ for some nonnegative integer $d$, and (2) unlike $\\mathcal T_4$, which contains every graph as an induced minor, the class $\\mathcal T_3$ excludes a fixed planar graph as an induced minor; thus it may be viewed as a special case (or potential counterexample) for conjectures about classes excluding a (planar) induced minor.

    "abstract": "The behavioral description of the sensorimotor synchronization phenomenon in humans is exhaustive, mostly by using variations of the traditional paced finger-tapping task. This task helps unveil the inner workings of the error-correction mechanism responsible for the resynchronization after a perturbation to the period of the stimuli sequence. Yet, fundamental contradictions still exist among different works in the literature. One of such contradictions only emerges after comparing the two most-common period perturbation types: step changes and phase shifts. The stimulus sequence is exactly the same in both perturbation types up to and including the (unexpected) perturbed stimulus. Why then would the timing of the next response be different between perturbation types, as observed? The explanation lies in the buildup of different temporal contexts during the experiments that recalibrate the error-correction mechanism. Here we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that responses to different perturbation types are dynamically incompatible when they occur in separate experiments. That is, they can't be represented by the same underlying dynamical system, thus explaining many contradictory results and the difficulty in reproducing both types of perturbations with a single mathematical model. On the other hand, if both perturbation types are presented at random during the same experiment then the responses are compatible with each other and can be construed as produced by a unique underlying mechanism. We conclude that a single underlying dynamical system can represent the response to all perturbation types, signs, and sizes, which is nevertheless recalibrated by temporal context. Our results offer a ground for performing better comparisons in paced finger tapping and extend the usable range of data beyond the perturbed stimulus and into the information-rich resynchronization phase."

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the \\textit{Swift} and \\textit{Fermi} missions have identified a rare class of ``double-trigger'' gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that produce two independent trigger events. These events are characterized by a sufficiently long quiescent period during which the on-board trigger system can reset, resulting in the subsequent emission being recorded as a second independent event. Consistent sky localization confirms that both trigger events originated from the same astrophysical source. Here, we present a systematic classification and characteristics study of three such cases: GRB 091024A, GRB 110709B, and GRB 220627A. We investigate each trigger episode emission independently using standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), hardness ratio, minimum variability timescale (MVT), spectral lag ($τ_{\\rm lag}$), peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), and energetics. We compare these properties with those of typical long GRBs (LGRBs) and with single-trigger LGRBs that exhibit extended quiescent periods. Our analysis reveals that all sub-bursts from the three double-trigger events consistently lie within the LGRB classification region. These results indicate that double-trigger GRBs are not a physically distinct subclass, but rather products of LGRB central engines that undergo extended dormancy and subsequent reactivation."

We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures.

To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression.

We propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion framework that can directly generate music-driven dance and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by the core principle of \"motion = content + style\", the framework treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for audio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausibility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio."

The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices."

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD."

    "abstract": "Joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has become increasingly important in medical research, particularly for understanding disease progression in chronic conditions where both repeated biomarker measurements and time-to-event outcomes are available. Traditional two-stage methods, which analyze longitudinal and survival components separately, often result in biased estimates and suboptimal predictions due to failure to account for their interdependence. In this study, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical joint modeling framework with an emphasis on predictive evaluation and clinical interpretability. The model simultaneously characterizes the longitudinal trajectory of a biomarker and the associated survival outcome through shared random effects, capturing the intrinsic association between disease dynamics and event risk. The Bayesian formulation allows flexible incorporation of prior information, accommodates irregular measurement times and missing data, and provides full posterior distributions for uncertainty quantification via credible intervals. We evaluate the proposed framework using both simulated data designed to mimic realistic patient trajectories and a real-world clinical dataset involving patients with chronic liver disease. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian joint model consistently outperforms conventional two-stage approaches in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and predictive performance, as measured by time-dependent area under the curve and Brier scores. The proposed approach provides a robust and interpretable tool for dynamic, patient-specific prognosis, supporting clinical decision-making in personalized medicine."

Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of I-PERI, as well as on its privacy-preserving properties, and present empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only \"see\" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference."

These subjects are interconnected, since the microscopic description of general black holes can be linked to very special irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional CFTs; conversely, one may draw interesting insights into black hole microscopics from the study of the exactly solvable $T\\bar T$ and $J\\bar T$ deformations. The Kerr/CFT part emphasizes the conceptual challenges faced by this proposed holographic description of general extremal black holes, especially in light of recent advances indicating that the classical geometry of extremal black holes is unreliable. The review of the $T\\bar T$ and $J\\bar T$ deformations is self-contained and presented from a purely field-theoretical perspective. It covers core topics such as the finite-size spectrum, thermodynamics, scattering, non-perturbative definition and the holographic dictionary for these deformations. Particular emphasis is placed upon the extended symmetries of $T\\bar T$ and $J\\bar T$ - deformed CFTs, including the perfect match between the symmetries derived via field-theoretic methods and the asymptotic symmetries of the dual spacetimes. These symmetries are also central to understanding the precise relationship between single-trace $T\\bar T$ and $J\\bar T$ - deformed CFTs and three-dimensional asymptotically linear dilaton and, respectively, warped AdS backgrounds."

    "abstract": "A recently proposed addition to the holographic dictionary connects extremal black holes to fortuitous operators -- those which are only supersymmetric for sufficiently small values of the central charge. The most efficient techniques for finding them come from studying the cohomology of a nilpotent supercharge. We explore two aspects of this problem in weakly-coupled ABJM theory, where the gauge group is $\\mathrm{U}(N) \\times \\mathrm{U}(N)$ and the Chern-Simons level is taken to be large. Adapting an algorithm which has been used to great effect in $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills, we enumerate 244 low-lying fortuitous operators and sort them into multiplets of the centralizer algebra. This leads to the construction of two leading fortuitous representatives for $N = 3$ which are subleading for $N = 2$. In the second part of this work, we identify a truncation of ABJM theory where the action of the one-loop supercharge matches the one in the BMN subsector of $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills. This allows a known infinite tower of representatives to be lifted from one theory to the other."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a semi-analytical model based on the Wiener-Hopf technique is developed to predict the turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise from serrated edges, aiming to account for the correct three-dimensional noise source and propagation effects. The scattered surface pressure over a semi-infinite flat plate is first obtained using the Green's function developed for the acoustic scattering by a serrated edge. A radiation integral over the flat plate of a finite size is subsequently performed to obtain the far-field noise using Amiet's approach, capturing the correct three-dimensional source and propagation effects. The model is subsequently validated by comparing it against the two-dimensional Wiener-Hopf-based model under various serration sizes and frequencies. Far-field spectral predictions show close agreement between the three- and two-dimensional models at moderate observer distances around $r/c=1$, where $r$ and $c$ represent the observer distance and the chord length, respectively. However, unlike the two-dimensional model, the present model successfully captures the far-field $1/r$ decay in noise amplitudes. In addition, the predicted directivity agrees well with the two-dimensional model at most observer angles, but also captures the correct dipolar behaviour at upstream angles and additional high-frequency lobes due to interference patterns induced by the finite flat plate. Compared to the previous three-dimensional serrated models, the present model is based on the Wiener-Hopf technique and achieves a speed-up ratio of two orders of magnitude. It is hoped that such a model may be used to enable an efficient numerical optimisation of the serration shape in realistic applications."

Consequently, deepening our understanding of mesophase stability, defect topology, and the dynamic response of LCs at the nanoscale requires the development of novel characterization approaches. This motivates us to perform in situ observations on model 4'-octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) LC using liquid-phase scanning transmission electron microscopy (LP-STEM). We find that the electron beam induced consecutive phase changes from smectic A to nematic (SmA-N) and from nematic to isotropic (N-I). The kinetic dependence of the phase transition on dose rate shows that the time between SmA-N and N-I shortens with increasing rate, revealing the hypothesis that a higher electron dose rate increases the energy dissipation rate, leading to substantial heat generation in the sample. We report on the spontaneous formation of disclinations, ordering effects, and complete process reversibility. Radiolytic effects of the electron beam are discussed in detail, and additional experiments with external heating indicate that the observed phenomena are mainly thermal in nature. The results are supported by calculations of heat diffusion, suggesting the nanoconfined 8CB differs significantly in thermal properties compared to the bulk one. This is the first detailed study of LC phase transitions using LP-STEM, which paves the way for further studies of nanoconfined LCs and for the development of the technique for advanced LC materials research."

This research explores an unsupervised learning framework for detecting rare and extreme driving scenarios using naturalistic driving data (NDD). We leverage the recently proposed Deep Isolation Forest (DIF), an anomaly detection algorithm that combines neural network-based feature representations with Isolation Forests (IFs), to identify non-linear and complex anomalies. Data from perception modules, capturing vehicle dynamics and environmental conditions, is preprocessed into structured statistical features extracted from sliding windows. The framework incorporates t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for dimensionality reduction and visualization, enabling better interpretability of detected anomalies. Evaluation is conducted using a proxy ground truth, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative video frame inspection. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively identifies rare and hazardous driving scenarios, providing a scalable solution for anomaly detection in autonomous driving systems. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to depend on proxy ground truth and manually defined feature combinations, which do not encompass the full range of real-world driving anomalies or their nuanced contextual dependencies."

We show that bounded variation and Lipschitz continuity of a set-valued mapping are inherited by its Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. We discuss the existence of regular selections for the fractional integral under the corresponding regularity assumptions on the original mapping. In the scalar case, we further identify extremal selections given by the pointwise minimum and maximum of the fractional integral and show that they possess the same regularity properties. Finally, we discuss possible applications in differential inclusion and directions for future research."

    "abstract": "In plasma edge simulations, the behavior of neutral particles is often described by a Boltzmann--BGK equation. Solving this kinetic equation and estimating the moments of its solution are essential tasks, typically carried out using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. However, for large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost. To accelerate the calculation, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method (Mortier et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) and a corresponding fluid estimation technique (Mortier et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys., 2022) have recently been proposed. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of KDMC combined with the associated fluid estimation. The analysis consists of proving theoretical upper bounds for both KDMC and the fluid estimation, and numerical verifications of these bounds. In addition, we compare the analyzed algorithm with a purely fluid-based method using the fully kinetic MC method as a reference. The algorithm consistently achieves lower error than the fluid-based method, and even one order of magnitude lower in a fusion-relevant test case. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits a significant speedup compared to the reference kinetic MC method. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of KDMC with the associated fluid estimation in nuclear fusion applications."

    "abstract": "Following the initial flourishing of large language models (LLMs), there has been a surge in proposed large vision-language models (LVLMs) that integrate LLMs with vision capabilities. However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities."

In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

Furthermore, we show that with the latest dataset of DESI-BAO clubbed with CC, CMB, and Union 3.0, the current value of the Hubble parameter is estimated as $H_0 = 66.945 \\pm 1.094$, which can be compatible with the available observations."

The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime."

While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices."

We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods."

In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector."

When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation."

To address these gaps, this paper proposes a higher-order argumentation framework with supports ($HAFS$), which explicitly allows attacks and supports to act as both targets and sources of interactions. We define a suite of semantics for $HAFS$s, including extension-based semantics, adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued semantics), and numerical equational semantics ([0,1]-valued semantics). Furthermore, we develop a normal encoding methodology to translate $HAFS$s into propositional logic systems ($\\mathcal{PLS}$s): $HAFS$s under complete labelling semantics are encoded into Łukasiewicz's three-valued propositional logic ($\\mathcal{PL}_3^L$), and those under equational semantics are encoded into fuzzy $\\mathcal{PLS}$s ($\\mathcal{PL}_{[0,1]}$) such as Gödel and Product fuzzy logics. We prove model equivalence between $HAFS$s and their encoded logical formulas, establishing the logical foundation of $HAFS$ semantics. Additionally, we investigate the relationships between 3-valued complete semantics and fuzzy equational semantics, showing that models of fuzzy encoded semantics can be transformed into complete semantics models via ternarization, and vice versa for specific t-norms.

In stage I, a high-performance algorithm is developed to jointly infer quasi-static channel parameters and calibrate synchronization errors from historical measurements. In stage II, by leveraging the quasi-static parameters as informative priors, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to estimate dynamic parameters from limited real-time measurements. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling low-overhead, high-performance channel estimation in dynamic environments."

Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_πL \\lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy."

A modified Jones-Faddy skew t-distribution utilized here allows to reflect this in a single organic distribution which tends to meaningfully capture this asymmetry.

Bulk photocured and 3D printed (with and without tertiary dye) samples were compared through observational assessment and spectral response. All samples showed pulse shape discrimination between neutron and gamma events. Inclusion of the tertiary dye has minimal impact on emission spectrum and light output, but significant impact on print resolution as shown by comparison of printed high-complexity geometries and feature resolution test objects. With the use of a cure-limiting dye, unsupported features, such as freestanding pillars, were resolvable down to 0.7 mm. Even finer resolution at or below 0.1 mm was achieved in fully supported, integrated structures printed with off-the-shelf 405 nm desktop 3D printer.

We resolve this tension with a novel model selection method that jointly optimizes model class and training window size using a tournament procedure that adaptively evaluates candidates on non-stationary validation data. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight. Applying our method to 17 industry portfolio returns, we consistently outperform standard rolling-window benchmarks, improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average. During NBER-designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis. Economically, a trading strategy based on our selected model generates 31% higher cumulative returns averaged across the industries."

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%."

    "abstract": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets."

This paper introduces \\textit{interID}, a modular credential verification application that addresses this fragmentation by orchestrating ecosystem-specific verifier services. Our key contributions include: (1) an ecosystem-agnostic orchestration layer that interfaces with multiple SSI verification services, (2) a unified API that abstracts underlying protocol complexities for service providers, and (3) a practical implementation that bridges three major SSI ecosystems: Hyperledger Indy/Aries, EBSI, and EUDI. Evaluation results demonstrate that interID successfully verifies credentials across all tested wallets with minimal performance overhead, while maintaining a flexible architecture that can be extended to accept credentials from additional SSI ecosystems. This work offers both a technical solution and architectural pattern for achieving interoperability in SSI verifier implementations."

We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The consistent orderings are in one-to-one correspondence with the Jacobians associated with all field redefinitions of a set of canonical degrees of freedom. For each admissible operator ordering--or equivalently, each path-integral measure--we identify a definite, positive Hilbert-space inner product. All such prescriptions define the same quantum theory, in the sense that they lead to identical physical observables. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to the Starobinsky model."

LLMs provide generally reasonable suggestions, but often fail to generate optimal plans that account for detailed user requirements, given the vast number of potential POIs and possible routes based on POI combinations within a real-world road network. In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings. Subsequently, we propose an explore-and-bound paradigm to efficiently process KATR queries by eliminating redundant candidates based on estimated score bounds from global to local levels.

A key concern, however, is that the convergence rates of such models can be arbitrarily modified by time rescaling, rendering the task of seeking ODEs with ``fast'' convergence meaningless. To eliminate this ambiguity of the rates, we introduce the notion of the essential convergence rate. We justify this notion by proving that, under appropriate assumptions on discretization, no method obtained by discretizing an ODE can achieve a faster rate than its essential convergence rate."

However, like other neural architectures, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations: subtle character-, word-, or phrase-level perturbations can poison retrieval results and artificially promote targeted candidates, undermining the integrity of search engines and downstream systems. Existing defenses either rely on heuristics with poor generalization or on certified methods that assume overly strong adversarial knowledge, limiting their practical use. To address these challenges, we propose RobustMask, a novel defense that combines the context-prediction capability of pretrained language models with a randomized masking-based smoothing mechanism. Our approach strengthens neural ranking models against adversarial perturbations at the character, word, and phrase levels. Leveraging both the pairwise comparison ability of ranking models and probabilistic statistical analysis, we provide a theoretical proof of RobustMask's certified top-K robustness. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that RobustMask successfully certifies over 20% of candidate documents within the top-10 ranking positions against adversarial perturbations affecting up to 30% of their content. These results highlight the effectiveness of RobustMask in enhancing the adversarial robustness of neural ranking models, marking a significant step toward providing stronger security guarantees for real-world retrieval systems."

This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials."

The multipole expansion of each body's center-of-mass acceleration is derived, and the expansion comprises the Coulomb-type part and the Yukawa-type part, where the former, identical to that in General Relativity, is encoded by the products of the mass multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies, and the latter, as the modification introduced by $f(R)$ gravity, is encoded by the products of the scalar multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies. As an essential component of the system's orbital dynamics, the multipole expansion for the total gravitational potential energy is provided, and the expression for the total conserved energy in terms of the mass and scalar multipole moments of the bodies is offered. To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved."

By analyzing four models of DM-nucleon interactions -- namely scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, and axial-vector mediators -- we derive constraints on the coupling parameters using data from the LZ, XENON, and Borexino experiments, covering mediator mass from $10^{-6}$ to $1$ GeV. As the mediator mass varies, the shift in dominance between momentum transfer and mediator mass leads to a turnover in the constraints around $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}~\\mathrm{GeV}$.

GANs suffer from slow convergence and potential mode collapse during training, while diffusion methods require multi-step inference that introduces considerable computational overhead. In this work, we introduce Flow2GAN, a two-stage framework that combines Flow Matching training for learning generative capabilities with GAN fine-tuning for efficient few-step inference. Specifically, given audio's unique properties, we first improve Flow Matching for audio modeling through: 1) reformulating the objective as endpoint estimation, avoiding velocity estimation difficulties when involving empty regions; 2) applying spectral energy-based loss scaling to emphasize perceptually salient quieter regions. Building on these Flow Matching adaptations, we demonstrate that a further stage of lightweight GAN fine-tuning enables us to obtain one-step generator that produces high-quality audio. In addition, we develop a multi-branch network architecture that processes Fourier coefficients at different time-frequency resolutions, which improves the modeling capabilities compared to prior single-resolution designs. Experimental results indicate that our Flow2GAN delivers high-fidelity audio generation from Mel-spectrograms or discrete audio tokens, achieving better quality-efficiency trade-offs than existing state-of-the-art GAN-based and Flow Matching-based methods.

We assume that the exponent $p$ is supercritical in the Sobolev sense. Since the spatial potential term $|x|^σ$ vanishes at the origin, solutions seem less likely to blow up at the origin. We construct a solution that blows up at the origin and also carry out an analysis of blow-up rate of solutions. In particular, if $p$ is less than the Joseph--Lundgren exponent, all blow-ups are shown to be of Type I. The lower bound corresponding to Type I rate is also shown for some particular blow-up solutions. As by products, we present a basic result on classification to threshold solutions for every $p>1+σ/N$."

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become the dominant paradigm for adapting large language models to downstream tasks. Low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA operate under the assumption that task-relevant weight updates reside in a low-rank subspace, yet this subspace is learned implicitly from data in a black-box manner, offering no interpretability or direct control. We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features. Our work demonstrates that incorporating mechanistic interpretability into the fine-tuning process can simultaneously improve both performance and transparency."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models."

An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\\%, 6.5\\%, and 5.3\\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters.

In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images."

To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks.

J1244-LyC1 has a highly significant ($10σ$) LyC detection, corresponding to an absolute escape fraction of $f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\! =\\!36\\%\\pm4\\%$ ($1σ$). The LyC emission is spatially resolved into multiple peaks that coincide with the system's disturbed morphology, confirming genuine multi-site LyC leakage. With a stellar mass of $10^{10.2}{M_\\odot}$, J1244-LyC1 is both the first confirmed high-redshift LyC-leaking merger and the most massive LyC emitter known to date. We interpret J1244-LyC1 as a merger-driven starburst system in which tidal interactions have disrupted the interstellar medium, creating multiple low-column-density pathways that facilitate LyC escape. This discovery provides the first direct evidence of spatially resolved LyC escape in a merging system, offering new insight into the potential role of major mergers in driving the cosmic reionization."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint."

    "abstract": "Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$. This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning."

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data."

However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF)."

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

In this work, we rigorously characterize the initial conditions and symmetry-induced invariant manifolds that give rise to such directional degeneracy in first-order agent dynamics. To address this, we introduce a stochastic perturbation combined with a contraction term and prove that the resulting dynamics ensure almost-sure escape from zero-gradient manifolds while maintaining mean-square boundedness of agent trajectories. Simulations on symmetric multi-modal reference distributions demonstrate that the proposed stochastic SMC effectively mitigates transient stalling and axis-constrained motion, while ensuring that all agent trajectories remain bounded within the domain."

Based on emission lines spectroscopically identified in the F115W, F150W and F200W filters, we select 99 H$α$ emitters. Through detailed effective volume and completeness analysis for each source, we construct the H$α$ LF in two redshift bins. Thanks to the sensitivity of NIRISS WFSS and gravitational lensing magnification, our sample reaches intrinsic H$α$ luminosities $\\sim$10 times deeper than previous grism surveys, down to $L_{\\rm Hα}\\sim10^{40.5}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\\sim1.3$ and $L_{\\rm Hα}\\sim10^{40.9}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at $z\\sim2.0$ with completeness larger than 0.8, corresponding to star formation rates of 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing."

Each ReSU projects a recent window of its input history onto a canonical direction obtained via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of previously observed past-future input pairs, and then rectifies either its positive or negative component. By encoding canonical directions in synaptic weights and temporal filters, ReSUs implement a local, self-supervised algorithm for progressively constructing increasingly complex features. To evaluate both computational power and biological fidelity, we trained a two-layer ReSU network in a self-supervised regime on translating natural scenes. First-layer units, each driven by a single pixel, developed temporal filters resembling those of Drosophila post-photoreceptor neurons (L1/L2 and L3), including their empirically observed adaptation to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Second-layer units, which pooled spatially over the first layer, became direction-selective -- analogous to T4 motion-detecting cells -- with learned synaptic weight patterns approximating those derived from connectomic reconstructions. Together, these results suggest that ReSUs offer (i) a principled framework for modeling sensory circuits and (ii) a biologically grounded, backpropagation-free paradigm for constructing deep self-supervised neural networks."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features."

To understand the biophysical processes underpinning lipid-lipid interactions in these systems, synthetic membrane models are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the formation of tubular networks from supported lipid membranes of controlled lipid composition on glass. We quantify tube radii using quantitative differential interference contrast (qDIC) and propose a biophysical mechanism for the formation of these structures, regulated by surface tension and lipid exchange with connected supported membranes. Two lipid types are investigated, namely DOPC and DC15PC, exhibiting a liquid disordered and a solid ordered phase at room temperature, respectively. Tube formation is studied versus temperature, revealing bilamellar layers retracting and folding into tubes upon DC15PC lipids transitioning from liquid to solid phase, which is explained by lipid transfer from bilamellar to unilamellar layers. This study introduces a novel model system for bilayer tubes, allowing to elucidate the biophysics of lipid-lipid interactions governing lipid membrane reshaping into tubular structures, important for our understanding of biological membrane filaments."

While previously shown to predict stall onset ahead of dynamic stall vortex (DSV) formation in incompressible and mildly compressible regimes, these criteria are assessed here at a Reynolds number of $1 \\times 10^6$ and freestream Mach numbers between 0.3 and 0.5. Unsteady RANS simulations indicate that DSV formation occurs in close temporal proximity to the attainment of the stall criteria. However, at the highest Mach number considered, stronger shock interaction effects with the shear layer leads to DSV formation prior to the criteria being reached, reducing their predictive accuracy. These findings suggest that while the criteria remain effective at lower Mach numbers, their definitions require modification in compressible regimes where strong shock interactions significantly influence the stall process."

    "abstract": "The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

For non-fibered strongly quasipositive knots, we study a relation between $F_K$ and the stability series of the colored Jones function, and explore similarities between $F_K$ and knot Floer homology.

    "abstract": "This work is motivated by the recent evidence for a double-copy relationship between open- and closed-string amplitudes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. At present, the evidence has the form of a double-copy relation for string-amplitude building blocks, which are combined using the multiple-polylogarithm (MPL) generating functions. These generate MPLs relevant for all-order AdS curvature corrections of four-point string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove this building-block double copy using a new, noncommutative version of twisted de Rham theory. In flat space, the usual twisted de Rham theory is already known to be a natural framework to describe the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) double-copy map from open- to closed-string amplitudes, in which the KLT kernel can be computed from the intersections of the open-string amplitude integration contours. We formulate twisted de Rham theory for noncommutative-ring-valued differential forms on complex manifolds and use it to derive the intersection number of two open-string contours, which are closed in the noncommutative twisted homology sense. The inverse of this intersection number is precisely the AdS double-copy kernel for the four-point open- and closed-string generating functions."

We then turn to the case where self-accelerating cosmology is driven by $K(X)$, finding that the time-dependence of the scalar field opens up the parameter space, turning the black-hole scalar charge from secondary to primary. We provide a stability analysis and a measure of the intensity of the kinetic screening from the quartic dispersion relation of the mixed scalar and gravitational modes."

In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

    "abstract": "Path planning is a fundamental component in autonomous mobile robotics, enabling a robot to navigate from its current location to a desired goal while avoiding obstacles. Among the various techniques, Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods have gained popularity due to their simplicity, real-time responsiveness, and low computational requirements. However, a major limitation of conventional APF approaches is the local minima trap problem, where the robot becomes stuck in a position with no clear direction toward the goal. This paper proposes a novel path planning technique, termed the Bulldozer, which addresses the local minima issue while preserving the inherent advantages of APF. The Bulldozer technique introduces a backfilling mechanism that systematically identifies and eliminates local minima regions by increasing their potential values, analogous to a bulldozer filling potholes in a road. Additionally, a ramp-based enhancement is incorporated to assist the robot in escaping trap areas when starting within a local minimum. The proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical mobile robot across various maps with increasing complexity. Comparative analyses are conducted against standard APF, adaptive APF, and well-established planning algorithms such as A*, PRM, and RRT. Results demonstrate that the Bulldozer technique effectively resolves the local minima problem while achieving superior execution speed and competitive path quality. Furthermore, a kinematic tracking controller is employed to assess the smoothness and traceability of the planned paths, confirming their suitability for real-world execution."

In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory. We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features."

Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy."

    "abstract": "One-to-one tutoring is widely considered the gold standard for personalized education, yet it remains prohibitively expensive to scale. To evaluate whether generative AI might help expand access to this resource, we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with $N = 165$ students across five UK secondary schools. We integrated LearnLM -- a generative AI model fine-tuned for pedagogy -- into chat-based tutoring sessions on the Eedi mathematics platform. In the RCT, expert tutors directly supervised LearnLM, with the remit to revise each message it drafted until they would be satisfied sending it themselves. LearnLM proved to be a reliable source of pedagogical instruction, with supervising tutors approving 76.4% of its drafted messages making zero or minimal edits (i.e., changing only one or two characters). This translated into effective tutoring support: students guided by LearnLM performed at least as well as students chatting with human tutors on each learning outcome we measured. In fact, students who received support from LearnLM were 5.5 percentage points more likely to solve novel problems on subsequent topics (with a success rate of 66.2%) than those who received tutoring from human tutors alone (rate of 60.7%). In interviews, tutors highlighted LearnLM's strength at drafting Socratic questions that encouraged deeper reflection from students, with multiple tutors even reporting that they learned new pedagogical practices from the model. Overall, our results suggest that pedagogically fine-tuned AI tutoring systems may play a promising role in delivering effective, individualized learning support at scale."

These are spherically symmetric dynamical solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a neutral scalar that feature: (i) a spacetime metric which tends to that of a static extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (RN), and (ii) a scalar field which displays the linear Aretakis instability ad infinitum in the non-linear theory. We employ the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to solve explicitly for the non-linear s-wave dynamics of the four-dimensional theory near an ${\\rm AdS}_2\\times {\\rm S}^2$ throat. For a teleologically defined black hole horizon, we impose boundary conditions on JT's dilaton field (which encodes the gravitational dynamics) and the scalar matter as follows: (i) the JT dilaton decays at late times on the ${\\rm AdS}_2$ boundary to a value that corresponds to a static extreme RN in the exterior, and (ii) the scalar obeys boundary conditions characteristic of linear Aretakis behavior on ${\\rm AdS}_2$. We ensure our DERN solutions are singularity-free and we note that our approach to DERN is accompanied by a final burst of outgoing scalar matter flux leaking out of the ${\\rm AdS}_2$ throat. The boundary conditions we impose on the JT dilaton place its late-time boundary profile on the threshold of black hole formation with sub-extreme and super-extreme RN on either side of our DERNs."

To regularize it, we construct an adaptive reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) whose kernel is built directly from the data. Under standard source and spectral decay conditions, we show that the reconstruction error decays in the mesh size at a near optimal rate. Importantly, we develop a generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based bilevel optimization algorithm to choose the regularization parameter, leading to efficient and robust computation of the regularized estimator. Numerical experiments for several Lévy densities, drift fields and data types (PDE-based densities and sample ensemble-based KDE reconstructions) demonstrate that our bilevel RKHS method outperforms classical L-curve and generalized cross-validation strategies and that the adaptive RKHS norm is more accurate and robust than $L^2_ρ$- and $\\ell^2$-based regularization."

    "abstract": "China's marriage registrations have declined dramatically, dropping from 13.47 million couples in 2013 to 6.1 million in 2024. Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the complexity and scale of embedded systems, especially in the rapidly developing field of autonomous driving systems, have increased significantly. This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs. The evaluation results show that after applying parallelization with the proposed framework, all patterns show a reduction in execution time, confirming the effectiveness of parallelization."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have significant potential for generating educational questions and problems, enabling educators to create large-scale learning materials. However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods."

    "abstract": "Closed timelike curves (CTCs) challenge our conception of causality by allowing information to loop back into its own past. Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities."

    "abstract": "We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms."

    "abstract": "Steer-by-Wire systems replace mechanical linkages, which provide benefits like weight reduction, design flexibility, and compatibility with autonomous driving. However, they are susceptible to high-frequency disturbances from unintentional driver torque, known as driver impedance, which can degrade steering performance. Existing approaches either rely on direct torque sensors, which are costly and impractical, or lack the temporal resolution to capture rapid, high-frequency driver-induced disturbances. We address this limitation by designing a Kalman filter-based disturbance observer that estimates high-frequency driver torque using only motor state measurements. We model the drivers passive torque as an extended state using a PT1-lag approximation and integrate it into both linear and nonlinear Steer-by-Wire system models. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and simulation of this disturbance observer with an evaluation of different Kalman filter variants. Our findings indicate that the proposed disturbance observer accurately reconstructs driver-induced disturbances with only minimal delay 14ms. We show that a nonlinear extended Kalman Filter outperforms its linear counterpart in handling frictional nonlinearities, improving estimation during transitions from static to dynamic friction. Given the study's methodology, it was unavoidable to rely on simulation-based validation rather than real-world experimentation. Further studies are needed to investigate the robustness of the observers under real-world driving conditions."

In contrast, tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying biomarkers like melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) are highly concentrated in the peri-tumoral interstitial space, offering a promising near-field target. However, at micrometre scales, EV transport is governed by stochastic diffusion in a low copy number regime, increasing the risk of false negatives. We theoretically assess the feasibility of a smart-needle sensor detecting MAGE-A-positive microvesicles near a tumour. We use a hybrid framework combining particle-based Brownian dynamics (Smoldyn) to quantify stochastic arrival and false negative probabilities, and a reaction-diffusion PDE for mean concentration profiles. Formulating detection as a threshold-based binary hypothesis test, we find a maximum feasible detection radius of approximately 275 micrometers for a 6000 s sensing window. These results outline the physical limits of proximal EV-based detection and inform the design of minimally invasive peri-tumoral sensors."

Specifically, we propose a simple yet powerful approach that enriches hallucination self-detection by (i) converting LLM responses into knowledge graphs of entities and relations, and (ii) using these graphs to estimate the likelihood that a response contains hallucinations. We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score. Our results show that LLMs can better analyse atomic facts when they are structured as knowledge graphs, even when initial outputs contain inaccuracies. This low-cost, model-agnostic approach paves the way toward safer and more trustworthy language models."

The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($ε$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites' evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems."

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects."

We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures."

A public notice hint is computed from the capsule to enable discovery without fingerprinting the recipient's key. Retrieval is authorized by a short proof of decapsulation that reveals no identities. All transaction intermediaries are ephemeral and issue certified destruction intents and proofs, allowing a noticeboard to publish auditable finalization records. The design provides sender identity privacy with respect to the recipient, content confidentiality against intermediaries, forward secrecy for transport keys after staged destruction, verifiable liveness and finality. We formalize the basic interfaces, provide the security arguments for encapsulation correctness, hint privacy, authorization soundness and timeout reclaim. In terms of implementation, it has been recently brought into production on the ICP under the name ICPP. It has been subject to exhaustive testing and incorporates a few enhancements, focusing on the operational possibilities offered by ICP's technology. This work hence serves as a broad reference for the protocol now publicly accessible."

Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure and properties of neutron stars in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $α$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds."

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) has been a foundational topic in artificial intelligence (AI), providing both theoretical groundwork and practical tools for its exciting advancements. From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety."

    "abstract": "Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition."

    "abstract": "The remarkable advancements in our capacity to synthesise structured light have facilitated the generation of any desired optical landscapes and even controlling the spatial distribution of light propagating through optically complex media such as multimode fibres. The availability of precisely defined structured light at the extremity of an exceedingly narrow and flexible cable holds the potential to stimulate a diverse range of highly sought-after applications, encompassing rapid communication, quantum computing, and, notably, imaging. What we lack in reaching these aspirations is the resilience of such light transport to deformations of the waveguide. Although recent theoretical investigations have delineated the attributes of ideal multimode fibres capable of deformation-enduring conveyance of structured light, tangible fibres possessing this indispensable trait to a practical extent remain elusive. Our study takes a deep dive into the precision of commercially available multimode fibres with the highest probability of demonstrating the phenomenon. We identified minuscule imperfections in their refractive index distribution, examined how these affect light transport when the fibre is deformed, and studied their implications for imaging applications. Our investigation has confirmed that these imperfections are indeed responsible for the undesirable alterations introduced into the output structured light fields during bending. Finally, as an alternative to standard graded-index fibres, manufactured by drawing silica-based preforms, we present narrow multimode waveguides in which the refractive-index profile has been established by ion exchange. These waveguides indeed exhibit previously unseen resilience of structured light transport even under severe deformation conditions and aptly fulfil the requirements of imaging applications."

    "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) metabolic quantification with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is of broad clinical significance for accurate assessment of BM at staging and follow-up, especially when immunotherapy is involved. However, current methods of quantifying BM may be inaccurate because the volume defined to measure bone marrow may also consist of a fraction of trabecular bone in which 18F-FDG activity is negligible, resulting in a potential underestimation of true BM uptake. In this study, we demonstrate this bone-led tissue composition effect and propose a bone fraction correction (BFC) method using X-ray dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) material decomposition. This study included ten scans from five cancer patients who underwent baseline and follow-up dynamic 18F-FDG PET and DECT scans using the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. The voxel-wise bone volume fraction was estimated from DECT and then incorporated into the PET measurement formulas for BFC. The standardized uptake value (SUV), 18F-FDG delivery rate K1, and net influx rate Ki values in BM regions were estimated with and without BFC and compared using the statistical analysis. The results first demonstrated the feasibility of performing voxel-wise material decomposition using DECT for metabolic BM imaging. With BFC, the SUV, K1, and Ki values significantly increased by an average of 13.28% in BM regions compared to those without BFC (all P<0.0001), indicating the impact of BFC for BM quantification. Parametric imaging with BFC further confirmed regional analysis. Our study using DECT suggests current SUV and kinetic quantification of BM are likely underestimated in PET due to the presence of a significant bone volume fraction. Incorporating tissue composition information through BFC may improve BM metabolic quantification."

The AI assistance problem concerns designing an AI agent that helps a human to maximise their utility function(s). However, only the human knows these function(s); the AI assistant must learn them. The shutdown problem instead concerns designing AI agents that: shut down when a shutdown button is pressed; neither try to prevent nor cause the pressing of the shutdown button; and otherwise accomplish their task competently. In this paper, we show that addressing these challenges requires AI agents that can reason under uncertainty and handle both incomplete and non-Archimedean preferences."

This yields an explicit fixed-dimensional trigonometric-polynomial representation and a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which directly implies uniqueness. We further establish an exact energy identity that yields the APS reconstruction error and leads to a sharp identifiability/resolution characterization: PLV achieves perfect recovery if and only if the ground-truth APS lies in the identified trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise it returns the minimum-energy APS among all covariance-consistent spectra."

Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices."

    "abstract": "Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 °C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes."

    "abstract": "Modern cloud architectures demand self-adaptive capabilities to manage dynamic operational conditions. Yet, existing solutions often impose centralized control models ill-suited to microservices decentralized nature. This paper presents AdaptiFlow, a framework that leverages well-established principles of autonomous computing to provide abstraction layers focused on the Monitor and Execute phases of the MAPE-K loop. By decoupling metrics collection and action execution from adaptation logic, AdaptiFlow enables microservices to evolve into autonomous elements through standardized interfaces, preserving their architectural independence while enabling system-wide adaptability. The framework introduces: (1) Metrics Collectors for unified infrastructure/business metric gathering, (2) Adaptation Actions as declarative actuators for runtime adjustments, and (3) a lightweight Event-Driven and rule-based mechanism for adaptation logic specification. Validation through the enhanced Adaptable TeaStore benchmark demonstrates practical implementation of three adaptation scenarios targeting three levels of autonomy self-healing (database recovery), self-protection (DDoS mitigation), and self-optimization (traffic management) with minimal code modification per service. Key innovations include a workflow for service instrumentation and evidence that decentralized adaptation can emerge from localized decisions without global coordination. The work bridges autonomic computing theory with cloud-native practice, providing both a conceptual framework and concrete tools for building resilient distributed systems. Future work includes integration with formal coordination models and application of adaptation techniques relying on AI agents for proactive adaptation to address complex adaptation scenarios."

    "abstract": "Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

As a consequence of our criterion, we show that for $g\\geq 8$ there exists no special family of Galois covers of the type we consider, providing new evidence towards the Coleman-Oort conjecture. Finally, we determine when the loci of double and triple Galois covers are totally geodesic."

    "abstract": "We study the family of commutative subspaces in the trigonometric holonomy Lie algebra $t^{\\mathrm{trig}}_Φ$, introduced by Toledano Laredo, for an arbitrary root system $Φ$. We call these subspaces \\emph{Bethe subspaces} because they can be regarded as quadratic components of \\emph{Bethe subalgebras} in the Yangian corresponding to the root system $Φ$, that are responsible for integrals of the generalized XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Bethe subspaces are naturally parametrized by the complement of the corresponding toric arrangement . We prove that this family extends regularly to the minimal wonderful model $X_Φ$ of the toric arrangement described by De Concini and Gaiffi, thus giving a compactification of the parameter space for Bethe subspaces. For classical types $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$, we show that this extension is faithful. As a special case, when $Φ$ is of type $A_n$, our construction agrees with the main result of Aguirre--Felder--Veselov on the closure of the set of quadratic Gaudin subalgebras. Our work is also closely related to, and refines in this root system setting, a parallel compactification result of J. Peters obtained for more general toric arrangements arising from quantum multiplication on hypertoric varieties. Next, we show that the Bethe subspaces assemble into a vector bundle over $X_Φ$, which we identify with the logarithmic tangent bundle of $X_Φ$. Finally, we formulate conjectures extending these results to the setting of Bethe subalgebras in Yangians and to the quantum cohomology rings of Springer resolutions. We plan to address this in our next papers."

While most implementations rely on spin-$1/2$ systems, we explore the performance of quantum annealing on a spin-$1$ system where the problem Hamiltonian includes a single ion anisotropy term of the form $D\\sum (S^z)^2$. Our results reveal that for a suitable range of the anisotropy strength $D$, the spin-$1$ annealer reaches the ground state with higher fidelity. We attribute this performance to the presence of the intermediate spin level and the tunable anisotropy, which together enable the algorithm to traverse the energy landscape through smaller, incremental steps instead of a single large spin flip. This mechanism effectively lowers barriers in the configuration space and stabilizes the evolution. These findings suggest that higher spin annealers offer intrinsic advantages for robust and flexible quantum optimization, especially for problems naturally formulated with ternary decision variables."

In this talk, we show that the line bundle on Grauert's example is nef and big but not semipositive, by explicitly computing its first obstruction class, which was originally introduced by Koike as a generalization of the Ueda class."

In this paper we focus on a best bandwidth selection method for use in an analogue of a classical KDE using the tropical symmetric distance, known as a tropical KDE, for use over the space of phylogenetic trees. We propose the likelihood cross validation (LCV) for selecting the bandwidth parameter for the KDE over the space of phylogenetic trees. In this paper, first, we show the explicit optimal solution of the best-fit bandwidth parameter via the LCV for tropical KDE over the space of phylogenetic trees. Then, computational experiments with simulated datasets generated under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model show that a tropical KDE with the best-fit bandwidth parameter via the LCV perform better than a tropical KDE with an estimated best-fit bandwidth parameter via nearest neighbors in terms of accuracy and computational time. Lastly, we apply our method an empirical data from the Apicomplexa genome."

Bitcoin-IPC subnets rely on Bitcoin L1 for the communication of critical information, settlement, and security. Our design, inspired by SWIFT messaging and embedded within Bitcoin's SegWit mechanism, enables seamless value transfer across L2 subnets, routed through Bitcoin L1. Uniquely, this mechanism reduces the virtual-byte cost per transaction (vB per tx) by up to 23x, compared to transacting natively on Bitcoin L1, effectively increasing monetary transaction throughput from 7 tps to over 160 tps, without requiring any modifications to Bitcoin L1."

Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements.

For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic."

    "abstract": "Modern AI models demand high-performance computation kernels. The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges. Moreover, frequent hardware updates and diverse chip architectures further complicate this landscape, requiring tailored kernel implementations for each platform. However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets. When evaluated on KernelBench using Triton DSL across GPU and NPU backends, AKG kernel agent achieves an average speedup of 1.46$\\times$ over PyTorch Eager baselines implementations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating kernel development for modern AI workloads."

However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark."

    "abstract": "The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research."

In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small."

Ultimately, the input impedance is matched by a novel triple-band matching network. An octave rectifier was fabricated and measured. Results demonstrate that the rectifier achieves over 50% efficiency over 1.3-2.55 GHz fractional bandwidth 64.9% at 0-dBm RF input power. Even with a decrease in input power to -10 dBm, the rectifier maintains over 30% efficiency."

Unlike the mutually disconnected arrangement of elements in traditional RISs, BD-RIS creates cost-effective and simple inter-element connections, allowing for greater freedom in configuring the amplitude and phase of impinging waves. However, there are numerous underlying challenges in realizing the advantages associated with BD-RIS, prompting the research community to actively investigate cutting-edge schemes and algorithms in this direction. Particularly, the passive beamforming design for BD-RIS under specific environmental conditions has become a major focus in this research area. In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset. Consequently, we derive useful insights about the practical implications of BD-RIS."

A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\\mathbf{L}$ by $\\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics."

The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs."

    "abstract": "The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models."

It is therefore crucial to study this phenomenon now and identify obstacles for the successful implementation of GenAI in the workplace, using tools that keep pace with its rapid evolution. For this purpose, we propose the AGAWA scale, which measures attitudes toward an artificial agent utilising GenAI and perceived as a coworker. It is partially based on the TAM and UTAUT models of technology acceptance, taking into account issues that are particularly important in the context of the AI revolution, namely acceptance of its presence and social influence (e.g., as an assistant or even a supervisor), and above all, resolution of moral dilemmas. The advantage of the AGAWA scale is that it takes little time to complete and analyze, as it contains only four items. In the context of such cooperation, we investigated the importance of three factors: concerns about interaction with GenAI, its human-like characteristics, and a sense of human uniqueness, or even superiority over GenAI. An observed manifestation of the attitude towards this technology is the actual need to get help from it. The results showed that positive attitudes toward GenAI as a coworker were strongly associated with all three factors (negative correlation), and those factors were also related to each other (positive correlation). This confirmed the relationship between affective and moral dimensions of trust towards AI and attitudes towards generative AI at the workplace."

While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity."

As their applications extend to increasingly complex scenarios, however, LLMs continue to face challenges in tasks that require deep reasoning and logical inference. In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness."

    "abstract": "Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs characterized by singularities in magnetic susceptibility at critical points. These results show that CIMs do not only serve as powerful platforms for solving combinatorial optimization problems but also provide a versatile optical simulator for studying universal quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems."

With recent advances in AI, these systems have seen an increase in sophisticated software agents that have improved task planning, reasoning, and completion capabilities. However, while existing work characterizes agent interplay and communication strategies, there is a limited understanding of the overarching design principles for intelligent agents. Through a systematic review of 90 systems (and 207 unique agents), we propose a design space of intelligent agents comprising six dimensions that collectively characterize an agent's perception, environmental understanding, action capability, and communication strategies. We contribute a novel framework for researchers and designers to explore various design choices for new systems and to situate a system in the current landscape. We conclude with future research opportunities for intelligent agents in mixed-initiative VA systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations. Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity. In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature."

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices."

This yields a frame-independent characterization of the propagating degrees of freedom and isolates a universal scalaron EFT in the metric branch, while clarifying the algebraic nature of the Palatini $f(R)$ scalar. We obtain, as a result, a frame-universal matching from the generic nonminimal couplings to a positive $R^2$ sector and a quantitative single-field attractor bound, enhanced by a $1/ΔN$ selection term, providing sharp and falsifiable CMB targets."

    "abstract": "The fusion of optical and SAR remote sensing imagery has become increasingly crucial for accurate multi-label remote sensing scene classification (MRSSC), which plays an essential role in producing reliable land use and land cover (LULC) products. However, visual heterogeneity between optical and SAR data, together with the speckle noise inherent in SAR imagery, greatly limits the performance of existing multimodal fusion approaches. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Frequency-Domain Progressive Fusion Network (FDPFNet) that adopts a hybrid CNN–Transformer architecture to serve as an effective and unified multimodal backbone for MRSSC. First, a Low-Frequency Convolution (LFConv) block is introduced, utilizing wavelet transform to highlight low-frequency components shared across modalities while suppressing high-frequency noise in SAR data. Second, a Two-Frequency Decomposition (TFD) block is designed to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, allowing comprehensive fusion of modality-shared low-frequency semantics while mitigating the adverse effects of inconsistent high-frequency details. Finally, an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) block is developed to dynamically balance intra-modal feature consistency and inter-modal complementarity across multiple hierarchical levels, thereby achieving more effective optical–SAR fusion. Extensive experiments conducted on the BigEarthNet-MM and SEN12-MLRS datasets demonstrate that FDPFNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed module and the overall architecture."

While substantial work has been done on resilient consensus using the mean-subsequent reduced (MSR) algorithm, challenges remain, particularly when considering communication time-delays and bounded disturbances in linear and nonlinear systems. To address these issues, we introduce a novel variable transformation that reformulates the resilient output consensus problem with delayed and sampled output data, into a continuous-time regulation problem. This transformation enables the extension of the weighted-MSR (W-MSR) algorithm to settings with bounded disturbances and variable time-delays. A key innovation is the incorporation of a drift term in the W-MSR update ensuring bounded system evolution under persistent disturbances. Using this transformation, a distributed controller is then proposed for agents in Euler-Lagrange form with unknown nonlinearities, disturbances and state delays that achieves consensus under adversarial attacks, utilizing only delayed and sampled measurements of neighbor outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology through simulations of a group of underactuated robotic vehicles."

    "abstract": "This systematic analysis explores the integration of blockchain-based trust management frameworks within crowdfunding platforms, focusing on their ability to resolve key issues such as fraud, lack of transparency, and limited accountability. Crowdfunding, which relies on trust between funders and project creators, is often undermined by centralized control and information asymmetry. Blockchain technology offers a compelling alternative with its inherent decentralized structure and capacity for automated enforcement. This study critically examines how smart contracts, decentralized identity systems, and trust scoring mechanisms based on blockchain can reinforce trust and enhance security in crowdfunding environments. The findings highlight that blockchain enables more reliable verification processes, tamper-proof transaction records, and automated contract enforcement, all of which contribute to increased stakeholder confidence. Despite these advantages, challenges such as legal uncertainties, technical barriers, scalability issues, and adoption resistance continue to hinder full-scale implementation. The analysis also considers ethical and regulatory implications, emphasizing the need for robust governance and interoperable frameworks to support long-term viability. Ultimately, blockchain has the potential to redefine the trust architecture of crowdfunding platforms by fostering greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity, offering a foundation for more secure and effective fundraising ecosystems in the digital age."

    "abstract": "Chest radiographs are widely used to clinically diagnose thoracic diseases such as lung opacity, pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 due to their cost-effectiveness and easy access. However, accurate interpretation remains challenging because of overlapping anatomical structures, low contrast, and subtle disease manifestations. Classical deep learning models are effective but often exhibit overfitting, and weak interpretability, which restricts their clinical applicability. This paper presents an attention-driven hybrid framework that integrates contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization-based enhancement with a dual-backbone architecture combining a vision transformer and a residual network. The vision transformer captures global contextual dependencies, while the residual network extracts local discriminative features. The concatenated representations are classified using a multi-layer perceptron and optimized end-to-end with the AdamW optimizer and a step learning rate scheduler. To improve transparency, gradient-weighted class activation mapping is used to highlight disease-relevant regions in chest radiographs. Experimental evaluation highlights that the proposed framework achieves 98.54% classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models, including EfficientNet 96.20%, DenseNet 97.50%, and a fine-tuned vision transformer 95.79%. To ensure generalizability, cross-dataset validation was conducted and trained on COVID-19 Radiography Dataset. The same model was tested on an independent COVID–Pneumonia–Normal chest X-ray dataset which achieved an accuracy of 94.07% and demonstrated good performance over heterogeneous imaging sources. These findings confirm the proposed framework’s robustness, interpretability, and suitability for real-time clinical decision support in both pandemic and routine diagnostic settings."

    "abstract": "Although haptic technologies that allow users to touch virtual objects have been actively researched in the academic field of haptics, they are not yet widely adopted in real-world applications. To promote broader adoption, designing haptic stimuli that elicit pleasant sensations is essential since hedonic motivation significantly drives user acceptance. However, how such pleasantness can be effectively induced through haptic stimulation during a user's active exploration remains an open question. Furthermore, it is unclear whether “pseudo-haptics”, a low-cost substitute for physical force feedback, can also serve effectively in this affective context. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the applied force during user actions and the resulting pleasantness, using a bow-dragging and arrow-shooting scenario as a case study. Specifically, we conducted three psychophysical experiments to investigate two types of force feedback. One type was a physical force that stimulated the kinesthetic sense, and the other was a pseudo force induced through visual manipulation. Our results revealed that pleasantness tended to be elicited when physical resistance force was present during bow dragging, whereas this tendency was not observed for pseudo resistance force. While there has been a general assumption that pseudo-haptics can replace physical stimuli to some extent in the rendering of haptic properties, our findings quantitatively show that in our case the two are not interchangeable for eliciting positive affect. We also found that the arrow's flying speed contributed to pleasantness as much as the physical resistance force, suggesting that pleasantness is influenced postdictively. Moreover, across all experiments, perceived pleasantness was strongly correlated with the perceived naturalness of the bow-and-arrow behavior. These findings provide valuable insights for designing pleasant interactions involving continuous force feedback, highlighting the distinct roles of physical and pseudo-haptic cues."

Unlike previous methods solely based on sparsity, we propose a channel estimation method that simultaneously exploits both the sparsity in the angular domain and the low-rank structure of the channel. Specifically, by leveraging these properties, the channel estimation problem is formulated as a matrix completion problem, where sparsity is promoted by incorporating ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-norm term in the objective function and the low-rank structure is enforced via a rank constraint. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the minimum number of samples required for channel matrix recovery and propose a two-stage sampling method. To handle the non-smooth ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>-norm term, we apply its subgradient method. To address the non-convex low-rank constraint, we adopt a retraction-free descent algorithm with a rank reduction to construct a search direction on the restricted tangent cone and determine the optimal rank. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method for channel estimation with limited samples significantly outperforms existing methods."

    "abstract": "Most experts contend that achieving resilience to hybrid warfare (HW), the synergetic blend of conventional and unconventional warfighting, requires sharpening of the West's technological edge. Of all technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) receives the most attention with specialists asserting that AI has strategic-level implications for HW. Meanwhile, one much less-examined factor in the technology discussions on HW is data. The lack of research on data is surprising, given the consensus on the critical role of AI in HW. At a minimum, from a technical perspective, one cannot train AI models without robust datasets. At a maximum, if hybrid actors can abuse siloed data systems to disrupt critical functions, then the West requires robust data governance to counter HW. This article thus asks how the data challenges of achieving resilience to HW could be sustainably resolved. The objective is: (i) to analyze the data challenges of tackling HW; (ii) to offer a working framework to resolve them. The text combines defense studies with latest insights from data science to argue that data spaces (DS), a novel data governance model, are uniquely qualified to resolve the data challenges of resilience. DS are trusted interoperable data sharing ecosystems that can supercharge national and international collaboration. DS can thus lead to enhanced detection and foresight of hybrid operations, more robust legislation and innovation cycles, and an overall paradigm shift toward data-driven resilience to HW."

Many car manufacturers and their suppliers have funded different software systems to fulfill the driving requirements. By the growing number of innovations, the rapidly changing technology and newer players in the automotive industry requires academy and industry to collaborate on their automated software developments. To do so, a common research and development framework is needed which inherently provides smooth transition of new solutions from one world to the other. Even though there are many open source research framework for rapid prototyping of automated driving functions, these solutions are often concentrated on low speed maneuvering, especially for the higher automation levels, such as robo-taxis. However, major automotive companies require developments of up to SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) level 2 and 3. Therefore, a new prototypical, open source software architecture<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> is proposed, that uses well-known tools and technology as basis, such as Robot Operating System or Autoware Universe, but also being closely in compliance with industrial architecture aspects. It is proven that the proposed architecture, along with its abstraction layers and interfaces provide modularity, and interchangeability of basic components, while the hardware and vehicle dependencies are well separated from the application software layer. Via few exemplary functions the usability of the system is demonstrated, and fellow researchers are highly encouraged to advise on the generalization of the system.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>https://github.com/jkk-research/CooperativeResearchPlatform/tree/release"

    "abstract": "The security of women in private indoor settings— including dormitories, restrooms, and bedrooms—continues to be a significant challenge. Conventional safety solutions, such as mobile phones or wearable devices, are frequently ineffective in emergencies where silent and discreet communication is paramount. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a vision-based system powered by artificial intelligence for the real-time identification of emergency hand gestures, tailored for use in privacy-sensitive locations. Our proposed methodology utilizes MediaPipe's 21-point hand landmark model in conjunction with a computationally efficient rule-based classifier. This classifier is designed to identify two distinct gestures: the internationally recognized SOS signal (characterized by the sequence: open palm, followed by a thumb tuck, culminating in a closed fist) and a newly defined gesture wherein the index finger makes contact with the center of the opposite palm. To enhance reliability, a spatial-temporal validation component assesses the intent behind the gesture by examining the geometric relationships of the landmarks and the consistency of motion across consecutive video frames, thereby substantially reducing false alarms. The entire processing pipeline is implemented locally using OpenCV, which guarantees user privacy and achieves a processing latency of under 150 milliseconds. Experimental results indicate that the system attains an accuracy exceeding 95% across diverse lighting scenarios, confirming its robust real-time performance on standard consumer-grade hardware. This research offers a practical, cost-efficient, and privacy-centric framework for silent emergency alerting, thereby contributing to the advancement of AI-driven safety applications for women in enclosed private spaces."

The analysis focuses on the Nakhchivan region, which offers strong solar resource potential. We formalize a relation that links the firm night-time demand to available TES capacity and a predefined battery block, and evaluate two representative configurations under a common dispatch policy. In both cases, PV supplies daytime demand, the CSP unit stores midday solar heat for later use, and the BESS (500 MW) manages ramps and short-term fluctuations. The first configuration is a larger-scale option intended to deliver <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 5 0 M W}$</tex> of firm power, supported by approximately 450 MW of PV, about 300 MW of CSP, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 14 \\mathrm{h}$</tex> of TES.

This presents a simple and cost-effective method for retrieving an object's vibration information compared to previous microDoppler extraction techniques. This method is easily implementable in a continuous Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) monitoring campaign which would increase the measurement's capability from only monitoring displacement per acquisition to also monitoring the object's vibration which could increase its usefulness for infrastructure health monitoring applications."

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the influence of distance-based clustering on the performance of Ensemble Learning models for cellular signal prediction. The methodology involved collecting drive test and operator data, followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering. The data was then clustered by distance using Quantile Binning and Fixed Interval methods. Various ensemble models were evaluated across three modeling scenarios: a specific model per cluster, a global model (baseline), and a global model with an added cluster feature. The results consistently demonstrate that the global model (baseline) approach delivered the most accurate and robust performance, with the Stacking model achieving the best results (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.80). The initial hypothesis, which stated that prediction error would increase with distance, was definitively rejected. In-depth analysis revealed that the error peaked at mid-range distances (100-250 meters), attributed to the high volatility of the actual signal in complex local environments like urban canyons. This finding proves that unmodeled local environmental factors have a more dominant influence on prediction difficulty than signal attenuation due to distance alone, offering the insight that more detailed geospatial features are needed to improve model accuracy in the future."

Art generation based on text-to-image prompts has been researched since 2015 with the development of Align Draw and has only grown since, with one of the most commonly known models being Stable Diffusion, a generative AI model based on Latent Diffusion Model. Stable Diffusion is trained by feeding images as training data into the model, where they are gradually reduced to pure noise, and then go through a reverse diffusion process where the noises are converted back into their initial states. In this paper, the process of diffusion model training in Stable Diffusion will be explained more thoroughly and applied to the training of a model to generate a specific building type. The model training itself took 7 minutes to complete all 10 epochs and a total of 240 steps. The loss during each epoch was shown. The loss peaked at epoch 8 at 18.3% but went down significantly at epoch 9 to only be at 13.8%. With the loss during training to be less than 20% at most, it is feasible to assume that the image generated by the model will hopefully be similar to the real thing."

It is demonstrated that the logic in a computer encompasses the existence and development of all emerging architectures, models, and algorithms. Relations are given that show the commonality of logical data structures for various types of computing, including quantum and Artificial Intelligence. A map of science and practice is provided, illustrating the relationship between key concepts such as science, engineering, education, and scientific results, all of which are essential for the creative activities of scientists, students, and engineers. A map of model minimization, its pros and cons for verification procedures, is given modelling for simulation. It is shown that to perform verification successfully, it is necessary to meet the requirements of testable standards to reduce the time for modeling and simulation procedures. To do this, it is essential to redesign (remodel) the digital product to maximize the enlargement of the logical elements of the new circuit model. A vector-matrix technology is presented for building a map to test functions and structures without relying on algorithms or processor instructions. Mechanisms for rendering any structure, function, truth table, and matrix using graph construction for any logical vector are given. Structurally logical constants are determined, enabling the solution of the problem of modeling a testing map for functionality or structure in a more technologically advanced manner."

    "abstract": "PolSAR data often introduces computational complexity and redundancy, limiting analytical efficiency. To address this, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used for feature interaction analysis, extracting key decomposed features such as PauliRGB, Cloude-Pottier, and van Zyl, which were combined into a multi-dimensional PolSAR feature cube. This served as input to the proposed feature-enhanced multiattention Dual U-Net (FMD-Unet), which integrates multiple attention modules for end-to-end, pixel-wise classification. Experiments on quad-polarization NASA/JPL AIRSAR L-band benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FMD-Unet, achieving a test accuracy of 99.89 percent across 15 classes. The model is computationally efficient, requiring under 3 hours for 1000 training epochs. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art architecture, including dual-branch PSPNet, FCN, DeepLabv3Plus, and USquareNet, confirm its superior classification performance. Furthermore, the model's flexibility allows it to function as a plug-and-play component for PolSAR classification tasks, enhancing its adaptability. These findings underscore the potential of PolSAR-based methodologies for agricultural monitoring."

    "abstract": "Monitoring cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in small freshwater lakes and reservoirs through satellite imagery presents unique challenges. The configurations and resolutions of current satellite sensors, which were primarily created for larger terrestrial applications, are the main source of these difficulties. This study uses the recently curated and modified open-source <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}$</tex> package, water quality, to suggest an efficient methodology for detecting and quantifying signs of dangerous algal blooms using remote sensing data. Our research focuses on algal blooms in Lake Windermere, England, and the Haiderpur wetlands in Muzaffarnagar-Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh, India. Using high-resolution satellite data gathered during August and September 2024, we investigate the characterization of BGA, MCI, and NDCI for Lake Windermere and the same period for the Haiderpur wetlands. Pre-processing steps specifically to extract water-leaving reflectance calculations were adopted using Sen2Corr and ACOLITE for both Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Landsat 8 (OLI). This conversion from TOA data to surface reflectance is crucial for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration, leveraging methods such as empirical indices, BDA, NDCI, and FAI. The result highlights the application of water quality proxies, including chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, FAI and turbidity, to assess the quality of inland lake and wetland designated site. With the help of the water quality package, integrating high resolution UAV imagery and related literature, researchers and water managers may improve water quality monitoring and make well-informed decisions more easily. By working together, we hope to improve our knowledge of the dynamics of water quality and direct decision-makers toward all-encompassing management plans that adhere to the concepts of SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) and 14 (life below water) for coming generations."

    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition caused by collapsing of lungs due to the presence of air in chest cavity between chest wall and lung. For its diagnostic purposes, a chest radiograph is commonly used to identify the affected regions (lesions). The manual diagnosis of pneumothorax has been challenging due to image variability in terms of contrast and uniformity in radiographs. Hence, to address this issue, we present TGAPneumoSeg, a Noval deep learning architecture that helps in pneumothorax diagnosis through improved chest X-ray interpretation. The model addresses these challenges by using an architecture that combines multi-scale attention mechanisms, text-guided embedding fusion, and a two-stage progressive denoising attention (PDA) process. We used the SIIMACR Pneumothorax Segmentation dataset to train our model TGAPneumoSeg achieving Dice score of 0.8394 and a Jaccard index of 0.8198, outperforming established models like U-Net, ResNet34 U-Net, Attention U-Net and PTXSeg-Net pretrained on ImageNet. The model integrates textual embeddings with visual features, which ensures precise lesion boundary detection while maintaining clinical relevance. Further experimental results demonstrate robustness and adaptability of TGAPneumoSeg improving patient care through faster and more accurate diagnosis."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Electromagnetic coilguns are increasingly recognized as a promising alternative to conventional projectile launch systems due to their ability to deliver high velocities through contactless acceleration. Among various configurations, reluctance-based coilguns are particularly affected by the issue of armature capture, where residual coil current continues to exert a retarding magnetic force after the projectile passes the optimal acceleration point. This undesired effect significantly reduces the projectile’s exit velocity and overall efficiency. Conventional mitigation techniques— typically employing SCR-based switching to abruptly interrupt current—often lead to substantial energy losses and offer limited flexibility in control. In response, this study introduces a novel pulse-width modulation strategy that employs IGBT or MOSFET switches to precisely regulate coil excitation. By tuning the switching frequency and duty cycle, the coil current is shaped to decay at the exact moment the projectile exits the magnetic influence zone, thereby minimizing reverse forces without dissipating stored magnetic energy. A digital twin of a reluctance coilgun is developed and simulated using ANSYS Maxwell and Twin Builder platforms to evaluate the proposed method. Simulations at charging voltages of 400 V, 500 V, and 600 V revealed a pronounced reverse force in each case, significantly degrading launch efficiency. To counter this, the SCR was replaced with an insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and the coil was driven using a 500 Hz switching frequency with a duty cycle of 0.8. This configuration effectively suppressed the reverse force and maintained the projectile’s velocity near its maximum across all tested voltages, confirming the practicality and efficiency of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "The rising demand for Home Health Care (HHC) makes its operational efficiency a critical issue. The HHC routing and scheduling problem is a complex, multiobjective combinatorial optimization challenge that aims to balance conflicting goals, including minimizing travel distance, maximizing skill matching, and ensuring punctuality. To tackle this NP-hard problem, this paper proposes the Adaptive Decomposed Proximal Policy Optimization (ADPPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework. The core of AD-PPO is the integration of a decomposition strategy into a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent. This breaks the problem into a set of directionally-focused subproblems guided by reference vectors. The key innovation is its adaptive mechanism: the agent dynamically evaluates the current solution’s position in the objective space and selects the most relevant reference vector to guide policy improvement adaptively. This allows the agent to focus its efforts on the most critical performance weaknesses intelligently. Extensive experiments on HHC benchmark instances demonstrate that AD-PPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of both convergence and the quality of the obtained Pareto front, offering an effective new paradigm for complex scheduling problems."

This restricts researchers' ability to study the impact of retrieval settings on model performance. PaSSER addresses this issue by enabling the systematic variation of retrieval parameters while ensuring reproducible results. The platform integrates three key components. A web-based interface supports both normal and score retrieval modes with configurable similarity thresholds. A computational backend aggregates eleven evaluation metrics into a weighted composite performance score. Blockchain-based logging ensures that parameter settings and results are immutable and can be verified independently. A controlled evaluation using the Mistral 7B model demonstrates the platform's capability. Two similarity thresholds (0.85 vs. 0.55) were compared on a domain-specific dataset. The evaluation reveals measurable differences between lexical precision and semantic breadth approaches. The scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating the functionality of the platform. Blockchain integration provides tamper-proof experimental records. This addresses the challenge of reproducibility in RAG research, where parameter variations can significantly impact results, yet are often inadequately documented. Future development will focus on automated parameter exploration, expanded metric libraries, additional model integrations, and multi-domain dataset management to support larger-scale comparative studies."

Currently, emulsion homogeneity is checked by taking samples for analysis. This process takes time and requires additional human resources. This paper describes a technical solution for emulsion homogeneity monitoring. It consists of turbidity sensors mounted in existing emulsion storage tanks, an electronic module, and corresponding measuring instruments. An experimental setup was developed to test the metrological characteristics of the turbidity sensors using standard kaolin suspension samples. Experiments have shown that turbidity sensors have an extensive measuring range, high sensitivity, and a close-to-linear transfer function. Using turbidity sensors allows for monitoring the stages of emulsion breakdown, such as sedimentation, coalescence, and complete separation into two liquids. Fixing the moment of emulsion breakdown in real-time makes it possible to apply three different modes to restore emulsion homogeneity by repeated mixing at different time intervals. It will significantly reduce the time to restore the homogeneity of the water-fuel emulsion."

A particularly transformative development is the rise of agentic AI, autonomous, goal-driven, and adaptive systems capable of reasoning and acting independently in dynamic environments. These technologies are becoming powerful drivers of innovation in the e-commerce and retail sectors, fundamentally reshaping how businesses engage with consumers and manage operations. One critical area in retail is customer satisfaction and brand trust, where online reviews serve as a key post-purchase feedback channel. Despite a benchmark maximum response rate of 69%, at least 30-40% of reviews remain unanswered, negatively impacting customer satisfaction and trust. In this paper, we propose an AI-driven solution designed to enhance the speed, efficiency, and quality of responses to negative customer reviews. Our approach outperforms current manual, automated, and semi-automated methods, offering a scalable and effective tool for improving customer engagement and brand perception.

    "abstract": "The very fast digitalization of electrical systems has brought remarkable opportunities and significant risks. Infrastructures that were once largely isolated are now significantly interconnected, relying on Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) platforms, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, and cloud-based services. Considering this transformation has improved efficiency and flexibility, it has also broadened the attack surface available to malicious actors. Highprofile incidents over the past decade, such as the Stuxnet worm in 2010, the cyberattacks on Ukraine's power grid in 2015-2016, and the SolarWinds supply chain compromise in 2020, have exposed the vulnerability of power systems to sophisticated threats. This paper explores resilience and vulnerability as two complementary aspects of protecting electrical infrastructures. Vulnerabilities are examined from many perspectives, such as technical, organizational, and supply-chain, while resilience is understood as the ability to anticipate, withstand, and recover from many disruptive events. More particular attention is given to emerging approaches, including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, the use of microgrids for redundancy, and the role of cross-border regulatory frameworks. The discussion is highlighting the need for a holistic approach that combines technology, governance, and international cooperation. Such approach is essential for building adaptable, flexible infrastructures that are capable of maintaining energy security in an increasingly complex and uncertain threat landscape. The major importance of this work is that it brings together cybersecurity and engineering perspectives, showing how real incidents are translated into measurable impacts on power systems and suggesting practical ways such as AI based monitoring and digital twin models, to empower their resilience."

The method relies on the real-time discrepancy between predicted and measured values to update the variances in the system's dynamic model. The approach has been validated on an electrohydraulic system, where both the load condition and the angular velocity of the drive shaft are estimated using an extended Kalman filter structure. The results demonstrate improved estimation accuracy under conditions of unstable dynamics. The study also addresses metrological aspects related to the influence of model uncertainty on the final estimate, which is critical for enhancing the reliability of measurement applications."

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable new opportunities for intelligent, automated O&M decision support. This manuscript proposes FusionOM, a dual-channel retrieval and reasoning framework that integrates semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG). The framework combines natural language understanding with structured domain knowledge to generate accurate, explainable, and context-aware maintenance strategies.Using 74 civil aviation accident reports as a case study, FusionOM improves cross-report knowledge coverage and reasoning faithfulness, shortens strategy generation from weeks to hours, and outperforms recent RAG/GraphRAG variants in coverage and consistency. The framework enables standardized, reusable reports and offers a scalable foundation for domain-adaptive O&M decision support across industries."

The fault severity level ranges from $5 \\%$ to $25 \\%$, with intermediate levels of $10 \\%, 15 \\%$, and $20 \\%$ being assessed. The investigation is carried out on a 0.55 kW finite element IPMSM model and stator current datasets were extracted for each severity for diagnosing demagnetization. The early detection of demagnetization fault is a key issue concerning efficiency, maintenance, and operation failure to be avoided. Machine learning techniques are employed to estimate the degree of demagnetization. A systematic data-pipeline preprocessing based on feature scaling and supervised learning was established for training able models that interpret nonlinear relationships in motor current signals. The proposed approach would be able to detect the fault at the earliest stage of $5 \\%$ severity. The gradient boosting regressor algorithm provides maximum accuracy with better values for mean squared error and mean absolute error."

In this work, we propose a Multi-Preference Indicator-Guided Algorithm (MPIGA), which aims to assist decision makers in identifying the most relevant optimal solutions. A coordinate transformation based multi-preference framework is introduced to more effectively reflect the preferences of decision makers. Subsequently, a preference-modified inverted generational distance indicator (PIGD${ }^{+}$) is designed to effectively guide the search process.

    "abstract": "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a cornerstone of quantitative research, providing the foundation for uncovering descriptive statistical patterns and preparing data for inferential modeling. While descriptive statistics and visualizations are well-established, the methodological bridge between descriptive and inferential analysis-association measures-remains complex. Different correlation measures must be selected depending on data types, and issues such as significance testing, spurious associations, and the exponential growth of pairwise comparisons in large datasets present significant challenges. Existing R functions such as cor.test() and cor() (base R), as well as rcorr() (Hmisc) and correlation() (easystats), each offer partial solutions. However, these functions are either limited to pairwise outputs, lack significance filtering, or introduce dependencies on external packages, which constrains their usability for large-scale exploratory tasks. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a prototype algorithm implemented exclusively in base $\\mathbf{R}$. The algorithm is capable of compactly reporting results, returning structured outputs suitable for further processing, and filtering associations based on statistical significance. By accepting flexible parameter ranges, it reduces the computational burden of testing all possible variable pairs, focusing only on theoretically meaningful relationships. Although the current version is a prototype, essential future developments include handling missing values, validating user-defined intervals, expanding support to multiple association measures, and enabling automated result export. This contribution provides a scalable, extensible framework that enhances the efficiency and interpretability of association analysis, offering researchers a practical tool for managing complex, high-dimensional datasets."

    "abstract": "Objectives: To design a small size planar microstrip antenna for use in ultrawideband applications. Methods: To make the antenna work in the ultra-wideband frequency range of 2 to 13 GHz the microstrip antenna of round shape is considered for the design. A circular slot in the antenna is made to obtain the desired operating frequency in the ultrawideband range. Along with obtaining the desired operating frequency it is important to obtain the gain the frequency range. So to do so the antenna array structure is considered. To reduce the burden of input signaling a single but unique inset fed power divider is considered to feed signal to the antenna. Findings: In this study, a circular slot-shaped antenna array is suggested. The suggested antenna has an ultrawide band frequency range of operation. Antennas with a circular shape provide lower return loss, higher gain, and greater directivity. The array’s primary purpose is to increase the antenna’s gain. The antenna is created using the inset feed approach. Design formulae are used to establish the size and feed method. The simulation findings demonstrate an excellent return loss (reflection coefficient) of -40 dB, which is well below the benchmark of 10 dB, and an estimated 8 GHz bandwidth ($2.42-18.21$ GHz). At the target frequency, the values for gain and VSWR are 6 dB at 13 GHz and 1.8034, respectively. At the intended frequency, the suggested antenna exhibits acceptable impedance match characteristics. Novelty: A round circular shaped antenna was considered in the literature to design ultra-wideband applications. But this leads to spurious radiation because of the continuous patch structure. To guide the currents and reduce the spurious radiation a circular slot is considered in the design which is by itself novel according to the knowledge of the author."

A dynamic threshold radius Rth follows the inner/outer user composition to balance load under equal bandwidth sharing and equal-share scheduling, with propagation modeled by 3GPP UMa and noise scaled with bandwidth. The Monte-Carlo simulations also estimate total cell capacity, spectral efficiency, and Jain’s fairness. With the composition changes from 75/25 to 50/50 and further to 25/75 (inner/outer), the distribution of capacities moves to the right and the mean-capacity increases by about 25% and then 34% (cumulative 68%), which is equal to the shift of the median CDF 28-31% per step (cumulative 69%). Spectral efficiency increases by about 23.5% and then 37.5% (cumulative 67.6%), with very small error bars indicating low variability between replications. Meanwhile, Jain’s Fairness Index decreases from 0.73 to 0.69 and 0.41, also confirming the efficiency-fairness trade-off for the baseline policy. These trends align with interferer-thinning in the reuse-3 outer layer and better utilization of effective spectrum as the outer pool serves more users."

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems ensures data immutability and traceability, making them well suited for decentralized content governance. However, conventional metadata anchoring strategies remain static and task-agnostic, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs between auditability, privacy, and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a Task-Driven Dynamic Metadata Mapping (TDMM) mechanism that adapts anchoring strategies based on task semantics and user roles. TDMM classifies metadata into three distinct anchoring types: full on-chain anchoring for audit-critical tasks, selective disclosure via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for sensitive attributes, and off-chain reference anchoring for general-purpose metadata. A dedicated mapping controller dynamically routes metadata fields to the appropriate anchoring mode according to predefined task policies. To preserve privacy without sacrificing verifiability, TDMM incorporates a hybrid ZKP architecture that processes proofs off-chain while anchoring verification results on-chain. We implement TDMM on a Hyperledger Fabric network, augmented with IPFS and Circom-based ZKP tooling. Experimental results show that TDMM significantly reduces on-chain storage overhead, lowers re-identification risk, and supports task-appropriate latency and throughput trade-offs, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing transparency, privacy, and scalability in decentralized metadata governance."

Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the transient temporal functions of electrical current strengths in stator-phase, rotor-field and short-circuited-damper windings, as well as of the resistant electromagnetic torque of the considered salient-pole synchronous alternator, during the three-phase sudden short-circuit process.

    "abstract": "Sunspot detection is critical for mitigating space weather impacts, yet evaluating models across datasets with divergent annotation granularities remains challenging. Traditional IoU-based metrics often misrepresent performance when predicted and ground truth bounding boxes differ in precision (e.g., tight predictions vs. loose annotations). We propose Coverage-based Mean Average Precision (mAP-C), which measures the fraction of a predicted box overlapping any part of a ground truth region, enabling fairer cross-instrument evaluation. Using YOLOv8 trained on two datasets (OGAUC: tight annotations; ROB: loose annotations), we demonstrate that models trained on OGAUC achieve mAP-C@0.6 > 0.81 on ROB—indicating robust detection—while traditional IoU metrics fall to <0.12 due to strict geometric alignment requirements. Training on a fusion of both datasets yields balanced performance (mAP-C@0.6: 0.77 on OGAUC, 0.80 on ROB). These results validate mAP-C as a more reliable metric for multi-instrument sunspot detection, supporting consistent evaluation in operational space weather monitoring."

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies that focus on low-resolution quantization, this work is more focused on the impact of weak nonlinear distortion due to resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is log (1 + γSNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver front-end, and γ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor (normalized one-sided quantization range) of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the uniform quantizer also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by log (1 + mmse · SNR), where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and it is equal to the minimum of γ. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, showing how small rate losses decay to zero and providing approximations for the achievable rate under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several “per-bit rules” for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks possess remarkable learning capabilities and expressive power, but this makes them vulnerable to overfitting, especially when they encounter mislabeled data. A notable phenomenon called the memorization effect occurs when networks first learn the correctly labeled data and later memorize the mislabeled instances. While early stopping can mitigate overfitting, it doesn't entirely prevent networks from adapting to incorrect labels during the initial training phases, which can result in losing valuable insights from accurate data. Moreover, early stopping cannot rectify the mistakes caused by mislabeled inputs, underscoring the need for improved strategies. In this paper, we introduce an innovative mechanism for continuous review and timely correction of learned knowledge. Our approach allows the network to repeatedly revisit and reinforce correct information while promptly addressing any inaccuracies stemming from mislabeled data. We present a novel method called self-not-true-distillation (SNTD). This technique employs self-distillation, where the network from previous training iterations acts as a teacher, guiding the current network to review and solidify its understanding of accurate labels. Crucially, SNTD masks the true class label in the logits during this process, concentrating on the non-true classes to correct any erroneous knowledge that may have been acquired. We also recognize that different data classes follow distinct learning trajectories. A single teacher network might struggle to effectively guide the learning of all classes at once, which necessitates selecting different teacher networks for each specific class. Additionally, the influence of the teacher network's guidance varies throughout the training process. To address these challenges, we propose SNTD+, which integrates a class-wise distillation strategy along with a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism. Together, these enhancements significantly bolster SNTD's robustness in tackling complex scenarios characterized by label noise."

    "abstract": "The model uncertainty and disturbance lead to an offset between sensed force and desired force by impedance model, which challenges stability and accuracy during compliant control especially when the impedance model is with high stiffness but low damping. In this article, a sliding hypersurface is formed by two cascaded first-order filters biased by force impulse and mismatch between desired impedance and filters’ dynamics. In this way, the force offset can be well estimated even when the impedance model is under-damped. Thereafter, the open-loop dynamics about the force offset is derived, and an adaptive jerk control is formed to attenuate the force offset exponentially. Moreover, passivity analysis demonstrates that this controller permits a wider selection range of impedance parameters, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Specially, its sliding gain is designed as a first-order forced response to the norm of the force offset, so that no positive feedback occurs when the force offset and the composite velocity error have opposite signs. Simulation and real-time experiments on a collaborative robot validate effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a key technology for next-generation wireless networks. ISAC systems face a challenge due to the differing priorities between communication and sensing metrics: communication focuses on maximizing data rates, while sensing prioritizes accurate target detection. To address this, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are introduced to enhance beamforming control, thereby improving both communication and sensing performance. This paper presents an optimization framework for an RIS-assisted ISAC system, aiming to maximize the communication sum rate (SR) while maintaining an acceptable threshold for the sensing metric, specifically the signal-to-clutter-noise ratio (SCNR). The proposed framework utilizes a low-complexity Riemannian manifold optimization technique to jointly design the transmit and receive beamformers at the ISAC base station (BS) and the RIS phase shifts, following an alternating optimization (AO) approach. Specifically, the beamforming and RIS phase shifts are optimized over the complex cone and complex circle manifolds, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this manifold-based approach, the same problem is also solved using AO with classical semidefinite programming (SDP) optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed manifold-based algorithm outperforms existing methods in both communication and sensing metrics, while also reducing computational complexity."

    "abstract": "When lightweight backbones pretrained on natural scene datasets are applied to object detection in aerial remote sensing images (ARSIs), the detection performance varies significantly. This variation stems from factors including the data domain gap, dataset scale, training configuration, and model architecture. Since remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) are pretrained on large-scale remote sensing datasets and exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities, we propose an RSFM-based auxiliary framework to enable existing lightweight backbones to achieve enhanced performance on ARSI datasets of varying scales. Specifically, the RSFM is leveraged to efficiently extract features with robust and rich representational capabilities from input ARSIs. A foundation feature fusion module is designed to fuse the features extracted by the RSFM with those from the lightweight backbone, addressing the inadequacy in representational capacity of various lightweight backbones when extracting ARSI features. Furthermore, a feature aggregation and expansion module is introduced to enhance the representational power of the fused features. Experimental results on four ARSI datasets of different scales demonstrate that the performance of various lightweight backbones is improved when integrated with the proposed RSFM-based auxiliary framework. In most cases, this performance is superior to that of larger-scale networks. Specifically, on the DOTA 1.5 and DIOR datasets, the performance of these lightweight backbones (integrated with the framework) is significantly enhanced compared to that of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Collectively, these results validate the effectiveness of the proposed RSFM-based auxiliary framework, confirming its ability to effectively improve the performance of existing backbones and thereby facilitate the popularization and application of existing technical advancements."

To address the challenges posed by the erratic maneuvering and swarm tactics of small UAS, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) architecture integrated with a curriculum learning strategy. Leveraging a high-fidelity physics-based simulation, our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making structure that decouples high-level target selection from low-level fire control and weapon aiming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based agent significantly outperforms a sophisticated, model-based predictive controller designed to emulate the engagement logic of modern operational defense systems. The developed system exhibits robust performance across diverse engagement scenarios, including multi-drone attacks from various vectors, achieving quantifiable improvements in targeting precision and reaction time against highly agile threats. This research establishes a foundation for developing intelligent, autonomous defense systems capable of neutralizing emergent and evolving UAS threats in modern operational environments."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the AIGC wave reshaping the creative design landscape, color design is rapidly transitioning from intuition-driven to data-intelligence. However, a critical \"semantic gap\" persists between abstract human intentions and controllable parameters of generative tools. To address this challenge, this study proposes and neurocognitively validates a computational framework for semantic color design, grounded in the Chinese linguistic context. The framework integrates two core modules: 1) Semantic Deconstruction, which constructs a multidimensional color-semantic lexicon from Chinese multisource texts using natural language processing and 2) Parametric Mapping, which establishes a controllable model to map structured semantics to quantitative color parameters in the perceptually uniform CIELAB space. Critically, we employed event-related potentials to validate the framework’s semantic accuracy in this cultural context. Neuroscientific evidence has confirmed that colors generated by our framework elicit cognitive responses consistent with target semantics; the N400 effect was statistically equivalent to that of a highly congruent baseline (equivalence test, p < 0.01). The study further revealed a hierarchical contribution of color attributes to semantic conveyance: hue played a decisive role, followed by brightness, whereas the influence of saturation was limited. The proposed framework not only offers a scientific paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in color design but also provides a computational blueprint for next-generation AIGC tools, enabling them to move beyond randomness toward precise, controllable, and semantically meaningful color generation."

To address this challenge, we propose the Temporal Reconstruction (TR) method, which enhances its learning ability on multi-scale temporal information by leveraging the hierarchical temporal processing mechanisms of the human brain in speech comprehension, enabling efficient reconstruction of temporal representations. Additionally, we propose Temporal Alignment (TA) method to enable the residual connection being used between the data with different temporal dimensions. According to the experiment results, we have obtained a SOTA result 96.04% on Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), and we have achieved a classification accuracy of 81.02% on Spiking Speech Commands (SSC). Furthermore, on the non-spiking dataset Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC), we can achieve the classification accuracy of 95.63%."

Unlike existing studies on event-triggered impulsive control where all node controllers are activated synchronously, each node in the proposed framework independently determines its triggering instants based on its own state. Initially, the interconnection effects are neglected, and node-specific Lyapunov functions are constructed and analyzed. Subsequently, graph-theoretic techniques, combined with the Razumikhin method, are employed to handle the cross-coupling terms and to derive several sufficient conditions. These conditions guarantee the <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$p$</tex-math></inline-formula>th moment exponential stability of the closed-loop system while explicitly accounting for communication delays and attack probabilities. Finally, the theoretical results are applied to inertial neural networks, and numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy."

In open-set scenarios, jamming of different classes have subtle feature differences due to similar generation principles, while same-class ones can vary significantly due to parameter disparities. To address this problem, we optimize the network backbone and region proposal modules, then introduce a novel aggregation method with unique prototype selection and a dynamic margin contrastive loss designed for jamming characteristics. These enhance open-set performance by balancing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Simulation results indicate that ONOJ demonstrates excellent adaptability and better efficiency in the real-world open wireless communication environment against unknown jamming."

    "abstract": "The rising deadline and heavy pressure on clean energy, as well as the dire situation with wastewater management, are two problems that are exacerbated by the rapid rate of urbanisation and the expansion of smart cities. Traditional wastewater treatment facilities are energy-intensive and have created secondary pollution, while also posing challenges for the sustainability of the requirements of present-day urban systems. At the same time, megacities are increasing their power consumption, which is taxing centralised power grids and also contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. This paper aims to address two issues: one is the introduction of an IoT-based Microbial Bio-Battery (MBB) framework, designed to be both decentralised and sustainable for the generation of renewable electricity and wastewater treatment. The system utilises electroactive bacteria in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) in conjunction with high-end graphene-based electrodes to enhance electron transfer efficiency and improve biofilm stability. An IoT-enabled sensor network, comprising pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensors, can be utilised to monitor real-time values of critical operational parameters. Using secure protocols, data can be sent to a cloud platform such as AWS IoT Core. To achieve maximum power output and treatment performance, a robust control system is employed, utilising an adaptive AI-based optimisation model that incorporates reinforcement learning to control the system's conditions dynamically. The results of the experiments show a significant increase in conventional systems, with power densities exceeding those of the baseline MFCs. This improvement is accompanied by a COD reduction of 92.3% and a biological oxygen demand (BOD) removal of 89.7%. Moreover, the predictive analytics analysis, utilising AI, demonstrated a validity of 98.7% for the payable energy output and treatment level, which further contributes to the robustness of the framework. The offered MBB system addresses urban wastewater management and energy access issues, thereby enabling the development of environmentally friendly, self-reliant Smart city systems. Its dual-purpose concept only underscores how well it can be scaled up to fit into decentralised grids and IoT-driven urban agriculture, establishing a radical change towards resilient and sustainable urban residents. The adaptive control module employs a hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model combining reinforcement learning and neural networks for real-time optimisation of energy output and treatment efficiency."

This paper focuses on the data collection aspect of sarcasm detection in Kannada, outlining the strategies adopted to build a high-quality, manually annotated dataset. We outline the data sources, annotation standards, and protocols to guarantee data balance and quality across sarcastic and non-sarcastic classes.

    "abstract": "Urban expansion often leads to the conversion of fertile agricultural land to built-up areas. However, current AI based land use change detection methods encounter difficulties in accurately separating short-term land cover fluctuations (such as seasonal farming cycles or construction phases) from enduring shifts like agricultural-to-urban transitions. These issues can result in incorrect classifications, unreliable assessments of urban growth, and ultimately obstruct effective long-term planning. This study addresses a key limitation in existing AI-driven land use change detection systems: their difficulty in clearly differentiating between temporary and irreversible land transformations. To overcome this, we integrate multi-temporal satellite imagery with detailed ancillary data, including cadastral boundaries, infrastructure overlays, and socio-economic layers. Our proposed ViT-LSTM framework captures both spatial patterns and their evolution over time, offering deeper contextual insights. This level of integration is especially vital for fast-growing urban centers like Bangalore, where informal development often conceals real land conversion dynamics. The method provides policy-makers and urban planners with a valuable tool for actively tracking, managing, and forecasting permanent land transitions with enhanced interpretability and accuracy. The research introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses time-series satellite data with supporting datasets—such as cadastral maps, infrastructure plans, and socio-economic attributes—to improve the reliability of detecting permanent land use changes. Utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) for spatial feature representation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal sequences, the model establishes a strong foundation for analyzing where and how such transitions occur. The system is trained using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, ground-truth cadastral datasets, and official infrastructure records. Experimental findings show a notable increase in classification performance compared to existing models. Ultimately, this approach equips planners and decision-makers with critical insights to drive more informed, sustainable land use policies."

The key idea is to configure the RIS for mitigating the self-interference at the receiver antennas so that the analog-digital converters (ADCs) would not be saturated. By taking into account the quantization noise, we propose to maximize the weighted sum of the uplink and the downlink rates by jointly optimizing the reflection coefficients of the RIS and the precoding vector of the BS.

We rigorously assess augmented data's clinical accuracy and stylistic similarity to radiologist-authored reports through expert evaluations. Interestingly, augmented data enhances RRG model performance, yet performance declines when augmented data surpasses original data volume due to style distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we propose integrating a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) into the RRG model to separate medical semantics from writing styles during training, enabling better handling of augmented data's distribution shift.

We developed a first model capable of increasing the resolution of any satellite image by a factor of 4, and a Sentinel-2-specific model that can increase the resolution by a factor of 8 (from 10 m to 1.25 m). Our method is GAN-based (faster than diffusion models)."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate assessment of ischemic damage is critical for acute stroke management. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a standardized tool used to estimate infarct extent and guide treatment decisions. However, manual ASPECTS scoring on non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) faces critical constraints: labor-intensive expert interpretation, substantial inter/intra-rater variability, time-consuming multi-region assessment, and poor sensitivity to early ischemic changes with subtle hypodensity. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework for binary ASPECTS classification (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\leq 6$</tex> vs. <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&gt;6$</tex>), the critical threshold for thrombectomy eligibility, to support treatment triage and prognosis without relying on pixel-level annotations. Our method begins with entropy-based slice selection to identify the most informative axial slices from each NCCT volume. A 3D convolutional neural network is then trained using volume-level binary ASPECTS labels, enhanced by auxiliary supervision from binary labels for each of the ten ASPECTS regions to encourage region-aware learning. This enables robust infarct pattern recognition while avoiding the need for detailed segmentation masks. Our method achieves strong binary ASPECTS classification performance (AUROC: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 0. 3 6} \\boldsymbol{\\pm} \\mathbf{8. 4 4}$</tex>) while substantially reducing annotation requirements, highlighting its promise for integration into realworld stroke triage workflows."

It proposes RoadAware-DIRL, which applies decentralised edge sensing, real-time data merging, and IRL to create a more effective framework for passing information between edge computing devices, thereby improving vehicular navigation. Static maps and re-updated traffic feeds are the mainstays of traditional routing, making it hard for them to deal with quick changes on the roads. With the help of decentralised sensors and an effective noise filter, RoadAware-DIRL fills this gap by keeping a constant track of the road and making sure the data is reliable. This Decision Engine behaves like a human does by using information from stressful navigation events from the past. In addition, a Predictive Obstruction Forecaster depends on recurring road changes to predict where trouble will occur and steer traffic in another direction. Hazardous routes are given higher penalties in a Contextual Cost Map, and MPC keeps making split-second adjustments to the planned path. Extra support for communication is available thanks to V2V and V2I layers, which set up a network of moving road scouts. This framework is better than existing ones since it can adapt flexibly, make decisions locally, and learn like a person. Improved performance, swifter handling of hazards, and less travel disruption support the usage of the system in both autonomous and semi-autonomous cars. The platform makes today’s urban roadways more resilient and aware of the situations they encounter."

    "abstract": "Efficient thermal and power management in modern multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) demands accurate power consumption estimation. One of the state-of-theart approaches, Alternative Blind Power Identification (ABPI), theoretically eliminates the dependence on steady-state temperatures, addressing a major shortcoming of previous approaches. However, ABPI performance has remained unverified in actual hardware implementations. In this study, we conducted the first empirical validation of ABPI on commercial hardware using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier AGX platform. Our findings reveal that, while ABPI provides computational efficiency and independence from steady-state temperature, it exhibits considerable accuracy deficiencies in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Custom Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CPINNs) with the underlying thermal model of ABPI. Our approach utilizes a specialized loss function that constrains the data-driven model according to the system's thermal physics, complemented by NSGA-II multi-objective optimization with efficient convergence strategies to balance estimation accuracy and computational cost. In experimental validation, CPINN-ABPI achieves a reduction of 84.7% CPU and 73.9% GPU in the mean absolute error (MAE) relative to ABPI, with the weighted mean absolute percentage error (WMAPE) improving from 47%-81% to ~ 12%. The method maintains real-time performance with 195.3µs of inference time. Extensive evaluation on unseen benchmarks demonstrates robust generalization without overfitting."

The study evaluates heuristic-based, distancebased, and ML-driven handover strategies, demonstrating that ML-enhanced approaches reduce packet loss, improve network throughput, and ensure seamless connectivity. Results show that the ML-driven approach dynamically adjusts handover triggers based on real-time network conditions, improving network efficiency. The ML-based handover consistently outperforms Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and distance-based methods, reducing packet loss to 0.5% for UE2 and 0.3% for UE3, compared to 2.7% and 1% with RSRP, and 1.3% and 1.2% with distance-based handovers. Additionally, ML achieves $\\mathbf{1 5 - 2 0 \\%}$ higher throughput with fewer performance dips.

This issue is particularly significant in systems with low-power transmitters. This paper introduces a method for reconstructing or predicting lost data samples using polynomial regression and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The approach separates the stationary and non-stationary components of the received signals and reconstructs them independently using various combinations of the proposed techniques. The optimal regression fit order for the non-stationary component is determined by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the reconstructed signal. The proposed method iteratively estimates the distribution parameters of the signal and utilizes matrix completion to recover missing or corrupted data samples. The method is validated using sample data for launch vehicle telemetry system and evaluated under different levels of data loss. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed across various regression configurations, with a comparative assessment of loss percentage versus MSE of the reconstructed signal. Results indicate that fitting the nonstationary signal component with polynomial regression of order higher than five, combined with Expectation-Maximization-based stationary signal reconstruction, yields superior reconstruction accuracy."

This paper quantitatively analyzes the effectiveness of data compression not just for bandwidth efficiency, but as a proactive channel mitigation strategy. The methodology utilizes a software simulation framework featuring a custom Channel Emulator, which combines a Log-distance propagation model to calculate large-scale path loss and a Gilbert-Elliot stochastic model to replicate the bursty error characteristics of small-scale fading. The results demonstrate that compression significantly enhances link performance, especially in challenging conditions. Specifically, in the simulated NLOS-Urban scenario, compression reduced the relative PER by 21.8%, which directly translated into a 14.3% extension of the reliable operational range. Furthermore, the corresponding reduction in ARQ retransmissions improved effective goodput by 11.8% and reduced average end-to-end latency by a substantial 41.1%. The findings prove that data compression is an essential strategy for building more robust, reliable, and responsive telemetry systems for demanding NLOS applications."

    "abstract": "Amid increasingly stringent data privacy regulations and growing demands for cross-institutional data collaboration, vertical federated learning (VFL) has garnered considerable research interest as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm. In VFL, where data is distributedly stored under strict privacy guarantees, traditional feature selection methods are not directly applicable. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an interactive feature selection approach based on differential privacy (DP-IFS). By introducing carefully calibrated noise during the processing of distributed matrices and mutual information calculations, the method enables the assessment of feature interactions and facilitates efficient feature selection without exposing sensitive data. Experimental results demonstrate that this method not only ensures robust privacy protection, but also achieves feature selection accuracy (79%~90%) comparable to state-of-the-art ciphertext-based approaches. Furthermore, it reduces the number of selected features by 25% to 55% compared to other advanced methods. This reduction not only enhances computational efficiency but also significantly lowers storage overhead, thereby improving the method's practical applicability."

    "abstract": "Effective metadata management is fundamental to data governance, ensuring that data assets are discoverable, understandable, and usable across the enterprise. However, traditional metadata systems often remain purely technical, describing structures without conveying business meaning. This disconnect — known as the semantic gap — limits the interpretability and value of metadata for business users. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Cognitive Data Catalog (CDC) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-readable, business-oriented descriptions for tables and attributes using their names, data types, and sample values. A quantitative measure, the Semantic Gap Index (SGI), is introduced to assess the improvement in semantic richness achieved through LLM-based enrichment.Experimental evaluation with several LLMs demonstrates that the proposed approach substantially enhances metadata completeness and interpretability, reduces manual documentation effort, and accelerates data discovery. The results confirm the potential of LLMs to advance metadata management by transforming conventional catalogs into intelligent, semantically aware knowledge systems."

    "abstract": "IT Governance is a key structure that ensures that information technology (IT) serves the strategic objectives of an organization. IT Governance involves establishing policies, procedures, and structures to manage IT risks, optimize IT investments, and attain regulatory compliance. A good IT Governance structure enhances decision-making and organizational performance. One of the most critical aspects of IT Governance is risk management, which entails recognizing and containing various IT-related risks, such as data privacy and security concerns. Decision Support Systems (DSS) play a central role in assisting managers in making decisions through the collection and analysis of information from various sources. Using DSS at Super Plastin could make payroll processing and attendance tracking computerized, which could mean fewer mistakes and accurate payroll. DSS has made managing attendance and payroll easier at Super Plastin and gotten rid of mistakes. This convergence enhances decision-making through analytical models and expert databases."

    "abstract": "Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) are widely used for their interpretability and efficiency. However, in high-dimensional scenarios, conventional zero-order models often suffer from numerical underflow due to the multiplicative aggregation of membership values. Existing models typically alleviate numerical underflow by increasing the width of the Gaussian membership function (GMF), which inevitably reduces semantic clarity. To achieve a similar effect while preserving interpretability, we introduce the concept of fractional calculus into the Gaussian kernel function and thus design the fractional-order GMF (FGMF). Based on FGMF, we develop an FGMF-based FNN (FGMF-FNN) to effectively handle high-dimensional challenges. Experimental results on high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that FGMF-FNN can significantly mitigate numerical underflow while achieving higher generalization performance than competing models."

We explore transfer learning as a strategy to mitigate data scarcity, initializing Spanish–Mapudungun models from high-resource pairs (Spanish–English and Spanish–Finnish). Using a standardized 10,000-pair corpus, we show that transfer learning markedly improves translation quality in both directions over models trained from scratch. We further analyze whether the linguistic characteristics of the parent language—particularly morphological similarity—affect transfer effectiveness. Results indicate that both parent models achieve similar gains, suggesting that vocabulary coverage and tokenization dominate over morphological resemblance. These findings demonstrate the utility of transfer learning for endangered languages and underscore the need for linguistically informed methods and community involvement in revitalization efforts."

    "abstract": "With the expansion of attacks, computer security has become a primary focus in protecting users’ privacy. When attacking a system, attackers must keep their remote shell active to perform post-attacks. That is, to maintain the stability of the connection. The injection and migration processes are suitable techniques for achieving this goal. However, it is not always easy to peacefully land on a device without prior infecting and/or bypassing the security measures set on the target device. Various techniques can be used to obtain that foothold access, for example, remote code execution, command injection, phishing, etc. Phishing is often a complex scenario; nonetheless, it can be highly significant for attackers. Due to the trust Microsoft Office has earned from companies, adversaries can exploit it through phishing to prepare a shellcode (payload) in Word memory, which is sufficient for the landing phase. In this paper, we will analyze the working techniques that usually help attackers obtain a callback upon arrival at the victim’s target."

Agent training is performed using tabular Q-learning with subsequent sensitivity analysis of criterion weights. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined strategy provides an optimal balance between average losses. Special attention is paid to the analysis of tail risks (upper 5% of the distribution), characterized by duration exceeding 120 minutes and losses 2-2.5 times higher than median values.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of digitalization and artificial intelligence workloads has positioned data centers among the fastest-growing electricity consumers worldwide. Traditionally viewed as passive loads, modern data centers possess advanced energy infrastructures, such as uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, battery storage, and intelligent cooling, that can be leveraged as flexible resources for smart grid operation. This paper proposes an integration framework between Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) and Smart Grid Energy Management Systems (SG-EMS) to enable bidirectional energy and information exchange. The proposed architecture coordinates local assets within data centers with grid-level control for demand response, peak shaving, and renewable energy utilization. A case study of a 10 MW data center equipped with a 1 MWh battery and 2 MW photovoltaic plant demonstrates that coordinated control can reduce peak grid demand by up to 18%, lower daily energy costs by approximately 17%, and provide sub-second frequency response without affecting IT service performance. The results confirm the potential of data centers to act as virtual energy storage units and active participants in smart grids. Future developments include AI-driven predictive control, digital twins for co-simulation, and secure interoperability between DCIM and SG-EMS platforms."

These intrusions not only put data security at risk but also threaten the availability and integrity of important information, posing significant dangers to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. This study proposes Machine Learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection using the widely recognized CIC-IDS2017 dataset, which is a benchmark in cybersecurity research. The research evaluates each approach based on the performance of classifiers after preprocessing the data to remove irrelevant features that have minimal impact on attack detection. The results show that the Random Forest classifier, combined with the Correlation feature selection method, performs exceptionally well, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of $99.61 \\%$. These results show the degree of efficiency of a robust data preprocessing strategy in enhancing intrusion detection systems’ capabilities in classifying attack traffic, namely DDoS, Brute Force attacks, scans, Webbased attacks, Bots, Denial of Service, and Heartbleed vulnerabilities. The comparison between total accuracy provided by these techniques makes such research valuable in terms of insights for optimizing cybersecurity defenses against dynamically correlated threats thriving in this digital age."

While system size, typically measured by atom count, is often used to estimate simulation performance, the impact of biophysical system composition remains underexplored. This study investigated GPU-accelerated simulation throughput using GROMACS on an NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU across eight atom count-controlled systems (approximately 82,000 atoms) with varying biophysical compositions. The benchmark set included water-only, protein-ligand, membrane-only, and membrane-protein systems, matched to the standard benchMEM system for controlled comparison. MD systems with high water and protein content consistently demonstrated superior GPU performance exceeding 30% compared to lipid-rich systems, despite equivalent atom counts. Membrane-protein systems exhibited modest improvements over membrane-only systems, likely due to more favorable domain decomposition properties. These findings provide quantitative insight into the influence of system composition on GPU performance and offer practical information for optimizing MD simulation systems in terms of biological complexity and computational efficiency."

Circuits with non-independent capacitors or inductors, as effect of the loops with voltage sources and, respectively, nodes with current sources, are modeled as causal systems at the limit. The effect on state-space equation is the appearance of the derivative of the inputs. This is a non-standard structure of state-space representation and sometimes creates difficulties in solving and integrating in the standard/classical form of various software tools. Two basic solutions are presented and discussed. The first one is part of the general method of similarity, which works with state-space equations. The second one decomposes the transfer function into two components, of which one is strictly causal and can generate the standard form of the state-space equations. The solutions investigated are equivalent from the point of view of the results. Two test cases are considered. A separate objective is related to the explanation of the methodology in developing a state-space representation starting from the topology of the circuit. The aspects considered are useful for engineers who work in the field of modelling and simulation and need accurate models from the system engineering domain."

This paper presents a simplified gate driver layout for SiC-based medium-voltage power modules. The design employs dual gate driver ICs per switching position to supply the required gate current, thereby enhancing the switching performance of the power module. The proposed gate driver adopts a two-level hierarchical PCB design: one level integrates the driver components closely with the SiC dies for reduced gate loop inductances and fast switching speed, while the other provides high isolation to support medium-voltage operation. The connections from the gate driver to the power module are provided through co-axial pins for improved noise immunity. The proposed gate driver architecture was evaluated using a discrete half-bridge switch setup, demonstrating high switching performance with measured slew rates of 104.23 V/ns for turn-on and 152.38 V/ns for turn-off."

Developed on a contemporary full-stack web framework, the system follows a role-based approach in which students can report failures, technicians can monitor repair progress, and administrators can monitor overall maintenance activity. The main innovations include an AI-supported fault category prediction module utilizing the Random Forest algorithm, workload analysis employing a Workload Balancer algorithm, and a smart NLP-powered chatbot that helps users follow simple troubleshooting steps. The chatbot is driven by a locally trained model with the capability to understand natural language queries about technical equipment faults.

In this study, we apply fuzzy signature models to address these issues within the evaluation framework of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee (MAB). A generalized fuzzy signature structure was developed, that supports discrete answer categories and hierarchical question groups. We systematically investigated how key parameters-fuzzy number shape, aggregation operators, and defuzzification methods-affect final evaluation outcomes. Two types of fuzzy coverage sets (core-based and support-based) were tested across multiple configurations using simulated data $(k=100,000)$ aligned with typical expert response distributions. Statistical analysis, including paired t-tests and normality tests, revealed that the Largest of Maximum (LoM) defuzzification method combined with arithmetic mean aggregation and a core-to-support ratio of 0.75 yielded the highest classification accuracy ($83.77 \\%$) and the most stable results. Core-based (Type 1) coverage consistently outperformed support-based (Type 2) coverage in 98% of tested configurations. These findings provide practical guidance for the design of robust and interpretable fuzzy evaluation systems and support the development of more transparent quality assurance tools in higher education. This work goes beyond mere comparison by systematically analyzing the sensitivity of fuzzy evaluation systems to parameter choices, which is critical for robust system design of accreditation models."

While Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data provides rich spectral information, its moderate resolution poses challenges for identifying small-scale features due to limited spatial detail and mixed pixel effects. This study explores the use of super-resolution techniques to enhance S2 imagery, improving its capacity for tiny object detection. An annotated dataset was developed to identify aircraft and vessels across various areas of interest, enabling a comprehensive and detailed evaluation. The detection process leveraged a hybrid approach that integrates a YOLO object detector with a vision-transformer-based object density estimator. By combining these methods, false positives were significantly reduced, leading to notable improvements in precision and F1 score. These results highlight that super-resolved S2 imagery can serve as an effective and economical alternative for detecting tiny objects, particularly in scenarios where very high-resolution imagery is unavailable or cost-prohibitive."

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable relative localization is crucial for multirobot applications like exploration, search, and rescue missions. LiDAR-based solutions offer high accuracy in localizing surrounding objects; however, distinguishing homogeneous robots with similar appearances remains challenging due to the lack of distinctive identification features. In this article, we propose a fully distributed relative pose estimation approach by integrating LiDAR, ultra-wideband (UWB), and odometry measurements, allowing each robot to accurately and continuously localize its teammates without external infrastructure. Specifically, potential anonymous teammate robot clusters from LiDAR scans are tracked by a dynamic tracker. We then identify teammate robots from these tracked anonymous clusters using a joint matching strategy, ensuring reliable data association between robots and clusters. Finally, by combining the corresponding LiDAR observations, UWB ranging, and odometry measurements, each robot precisely localizes others while minimizing data exchange. The system requires only odometry data exchange through onboard UWB, eliminating the need for additional communication infrastructure like WiFi routers or mesh networks. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed relative localization approach."

    "abstract": "With the increasing frequency of port trade activities, oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems. The complex port environments, characterized by diverse land cover types and intricate land-water interfaces, present significant challenges for oil spill detection (OSD). To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach based on the segment anything model (SAM) for port OSD tasks utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing imagery. The proposed DADS-SAM freezes most parameters of SAM and performs PEFT only on adapters. Dynamic adaptive low-rank adaptation (DALoRA) enhances the model’s adaptability to port OSD tasks by incorporating dynamic adaptive low-rank matrices into the self-attention modules of the SAM encoder, while dual scale convolutional adapter (DSCA) improves the model’s capability to capture local features and spatial dependencies in oil spill regions. Since the original SAM model lacks class-specific segmentation capabilities, we further design a multi-class segmentation head (MCSH) for oil spill segmentation. This head obtains the output masks from the SAM decoder, adjusts their dimensions, and transforms them through two linear layers to generate class-specific segmentation results. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a PEFT approach to port OSD tasks. The proposed method was evaluated on both publicly available port oil-spill datasets and marine oil-spill datasets acquired via synthetic-aperture radar (SAR). Quantitative comparisons demonstrate that DADS-SAM outperforms conventional approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated metrics. Models and data are publicly available at https://github.com/PetrichorAsh/DADS-SAM."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy in power systems, wideband oscillation issues have become increasingly prominent, necessitating the accurate acquisition of grid wideband impedance characteristics to support stability analysis. Existing measurement methods face significant limitations, stemming mainly from the inability to control the spectrum of the injected wideband disturbance. This lack of spectral controllability leads to two major drawbacks: insufficient energy concentration in the target frequency band, compromising measurement accuracy, and the introduction of substantial non-target frequency components into the grid, resulting in additional harmonic pollution. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a spectrum-controllable wideband disturbance injection method based on AC-AC modulation. To begin with, an improved chopper-controlled AC voltage regulation circuit featuring relatively simple topology is designed, injecting wideband disturbance into the power grid based on AC-AC modulation. Furthermore, in order to eliminate harmonic cancellation effects caused by multi-frequency disturbance injection, a novel Non-overlapping Band Optimized Injection (NBOI) method is proposed. Lastly, the Schroeder’s phase optimization algorithm is employed to reduce the crest factor of modulation signals, resulting in higher disturbance energy in measurement frequency band, within the range of modulation signal’s amplitude. The proposed method enables direct control of the harmonic spectrum, allowing precise acquisition of wideband impedance characteristics in a single test, offering an effective approach for the stability analysis of grid-connected converters. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves over 99% energy concentration in the target measurement band. The proposed method achieves a Harmonic Distribution Uniformity (HDU) metric approaching 0, indicating near-perfect spectral distribution uniformity across the target frequency range. The impedance measurement accuracy shows less than 2% deviation from theoretical values, validating the method’s effectiveness for rapid, accurate wideband impedance characterization with minimal grid impact."

    "abstract": "Railway infrastructure security is contingent upon the prompt identification of structural anomalies within steel tracks. This research establishes a framework that merges acoustic emission (AE) sensing with advanced machine learning for prompt fracture identification and location. To improve the quality of Raw AE signals, they are first cleaned using Kalman filtering to tackle environmental disturbances and ambiguous readings. The characteristics that arise from entropy comprising approximate entropy, Shannon entropy, and dimensional entropy are derived to delineate the temporal patterns of fracture-induced emissions. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied to remove outliers during preprocessing. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks classify crack locations into three anatomical regions: rail head, web, and foot. Experimental validation with 3,000 labeled AE signals (1,000 per class) under laboratory conditions, the full pipeline that integrates Kalman filtering, entropy features, DBSCAN, and an LSTM classifier attains an accuracy of 98.83%. With an entropy-based variant, the accuracy drops to 96.67%, confirming the incremental value of temporal denoising and outlier rejection. While using mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) baseline achieves 97.67% accuracy, a deep neural network (DNN) trained on Kalman-filtered, entropy-based, and DBSCAN-processed inputs reaches 96.33% accuracy, underscoring the advantages of temporal modeling for AE. A GRU using the same Kalman-filtered, entropy-based, and DBSCAN-processed inputs, achieves 97.67% accuracy, but trails the LSTM overall. When deployed on actual railway lines with a mobile inspection platform, the system maintained robust performance, correctly identifying 84.67% of cracks at 3 km/h and 80.67% at 5 km/h. The LSTM configuration consistently outperformed all alternative approaches, including the entropy-only variant, MFCC-based method, DNN classifier, and GRU model. This confirms the LSTM’s enhanced capability to capture the temporal dynamics of AE signals, establishing it as the most effective framework for AE-based crack localization in railway structural health monitoring."

    "abstract": "Adopting Model-Based Development (MBD) in automotive software becomes necessary because it provides a rigorous development process. As the increase in the number of software components (SWCs) and their interactions, modifications to one part of the software might impact other parts due to the high coupling of SWCs. Developing an automated software refactoring technique to implement high cohesion and low coupling of software is necessary. Software refactoring usually contains code refactoring and architecture refactoring. Code refactoring only modifies the code inside the SWCs without changing its original functionality and external behavior, whereas current architecture refactoring does not consider the interaction weight (strength) between SWCs. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this study, we propose a weighted community division algorithm called Weighted-Girvan-Newman (W-GN) for software architecture refactoring. W-GN algorithm refactors the architecture by dividing SWCs into modules based on the interaction weights of SWCs. We further develop an automated architecture refactoring tool called AutoToolMD. This tool assists engineers in improving development efficiency and ensures the architecture aligns with the requirements of high cohesion and low coupling. Evaluations show that W-GN indicates more suitable modularity values than the traditional Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm because the former can better reflect the real architecture with interaction weights. We apply AutoToolMD to automatically refactor architecture in automotive industry practice. Case study with the Zone_B PwrSplyMngt and Zone L_Lock modules in the Honda zone control software shows that AutoToolMD effectively refactors architecture with a significant improvement in testing efficiency and readability.</p>"

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "Multi-terminal high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission system is a promising approach to connect offshore wind power plants (WPPs) to onshore ac grids. However, there is no standardized protection method against DC faults. As one of its protection methods, mechanical dc circuit breakers (DCCBs) have the potential to improve supply reliability against dc faults while avoiding a cost increase. Nevertheless, due to their relatively slower operation, the blocking of half-bridge based modular multilevel converter (HBMMC) is often required. In offshore ac collecting system, where the HBMMC maintains the grid voltage, such converter blocking can destabilize the grid voltage and lead to shutdowns of offshore WPPs. Large scale shutdowns of offshore WPPs may have a negative impact on onshore ac grids. Therefore, this article proposes a protection method that enables the continuous operation of offshore WPPs while using mechanical DCCBs. The proposed method focuses on the backbone HVDC configuration connecting multiple onshore and offshore terminals, and applies different fault clearing methods across the terminals. At onshore terminals which form a loop configuration, mechanical DCCBs selectively isolate the faulted section. At offshore terminals which form a radial configuration, reconfiguration is employed to reroute power transmission from the faulted line to the healthy line. These operations are coordinated based on the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of offshore WPPs and realizes their continuous operation. The proposed method is verified by an experiment using the scaled-down three-terminal HVDC system."

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval (RSITR) plays a crucial role in the remote sensing community but faces difficulties due to the heterogeneity between the image and text modalities. While existing methods primarily focus on enhancing cross-modal alignment, they suffer from two key issues. One is that fine-grained local alignment approaches extract local features lacking contextual integration, which leads to semantic inconsistency. The other is that conventional losses fail to adapt to the varying model states of different subtasks, which may lead to the model calibration problems. This implies a mismatch between the confidence scores of the network and the true probabilities. To address these challenges, this study proposes two complementary components. One is a Local Semantic Consistency Interaction (LSCI) module, which uses cross-attention and self-attention along with an image-text alignment head to optimize multimodal representations and mitigate context-induced semantic inconsistency. The other is Task-specific Calibration loss (TC), which dynamically adjusts the gamma parameter in Focal or inv-Focal loss, allowing the model to prioritize both hard and easy sample pairs according to the calibration error specific to each subtask. The gamma parameter is adjusted by leveraging the previous states of the model and the knowledge of calibration performance on the validation set. By integrating the LSCI module and TC loss, the semantic inconsistency between image and text can be improved, and model calibration can be enhanced. Comparative assessments conducted on three public datasets show that our methods can achieve competitive performance on the RSITR task compared to many existing methods.

    "abstract": "Video steganography provides a method of secret communication by embedding data in the intricate frame structure of the video file, enabling the hidden data to escape hiding. This paper presented a video steganography system based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT) that embeds text messages into the luminance component of the video frames, and ensures that the data is robust against noise and compression by employing a repetition-based error correction coding (ECC) scheme, where the message is embedded by modifying DC coefficients of deterministically chosen 8x8 pixel blocks with fixed-strength (150.0). The steganography system was evaluated using a wide range of metrics including peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mean squared error (MSE), bit error rate (BER), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).In addition, the difference between the DC coefficient distributions in the embedding of the original frames and the steganographic one is represented as histograms to help chronicle the way the steganographic process may have impacted the frequency domain. The results of high PSNR and SNR with low levels of MSE, RMSE, MAE, and BER suggest a successful data hiding procedure by examining the visual changes to the steganographic frames. Comprehensive information is provided by the logging and diagnostic outputs the steganographic and video embedding algorithms produced, including saved DC coefficient distributions in the traditional frequency domain. All of these elements helped to show that DCT-based video steganography is a viable way to communicate in a secure manner and that there are possibilites to improve efficiency in hiding data, while minimizing impact to the visual quality of the video frame."

The UAV laser scanning could acquire high density point cloud data to detect individual trees, which were further used for estimation of forest structure parameters.

An individual tree detection algorithm based on Gaussian probability distribution was proposed to extract tree heights and crown areas in the temperate forest. The effects of the overlapping point cloud among flight strips and the smoothed CHM were also been analyzed. The Lorey's heights from field measurements of individual trees were modeled using the mean height and mean height weighted by crown area of detected individual trees. The metrics of point cloud were also extracted to model the Lorey's heights. The result indicated that the model of the Lorey's height from the smoothed CHM of all point cloud <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(R^{2}=0.950, R M S E=1.056 ~\\mathrm{m}\\right)$</tex> was better than that based on the NPC with overlapping point cloud (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\boldsymbol{R}^{2}=0.937$</tex>, RMSE <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=1.191 ~\\mathrm{m}$</tex>).

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simplified and model-based design of an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) in CATIA Magic Draw software. ABS is a vital vehicle safety system that prevents wheel lock during braking by helping maintain traction and avoid skidding. The control of ABS depends on nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the regulation of wheel slip ratio. Using the SysML language, we model both the structure and behavior of ABS with diagrams such as use case, activity, sequence, and state machine diagrams. This approach supports better system understanding, accurate documentation, and improved design updates. Inspired by methods used in aviation system modeling, this study shows how SysML and CATIA Magic Draw can be applied effectively in vehicle safety system development. The work also highlights the benefits of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) in creating reliable and traceable control system designs."

The method entails executing a series of atomic steps toward robotic process automation. Robots imitate human tasks and interact with transport planning and simulation software through either a graphical user interface or an application programming interface. The method involves sharing information regarding road signs, traffic lights, road markings, and road barriers as part of a set of restrictions imposed on traffic flows in a transport model of traffic simulation software and vice versa. The method facilitates the automation of repetitive procedures involved in sharing information between software for developing transport planning designs and traffic simulation software. We implemented the proposed method in software and conducted experiments on segments of urban road networks in Samara, Russia, using both IndorTrafficPlan and SUMO tools. Our experiments indicate that adopting the method reduces labor costs associated with evaluating the efficacy of planned transport management interventions by approximately 85%."

In such programs, products that meet program requirements can be sold with a special label to signal cybersecurity compliance. Currently, there is no evidence-based guidance or standardized implementation of labels or label-awarding program policies. We conducted an online survey to understand the impact of IoT labels and choices such as validation requirements (i.e., whether manufacturers need to self attest or seek third-party audits to validate their products’ compliance) regarding participants’ security and privacy concerns. Our research provides empirical evidence to guide policy choices by effective label-awarding programs. We find that the presence of IoT labels alleviated both security and privacy concerns; however, we did not find differences between other program implementation choices. We provide recommendations for IoT cybersecurity label programs and discuss the potential societal impacts of label programs."

The single antenna element of the proposed MIMO antenna module consists of a T-shape feed printed on one side of the RT duroid low-loss substrate and two rectangular slots loaded ground plane on the other side. The MIMO antenna designs have been realized using the anti-parallel arrangement of two antenna units relative to one another. The proposed MIMO has a small design of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$12.5 \\times 6.25 \\times 0.8 \\text{mm}^{3}$</tex>. The antiparallel arrangement is generating pattern diversity. The achieved impedance bandwidth ranges from 25.8 GHz to 32.8 GHz, including a total span of 7 GHz, which includes the critical band N257 (26.5-29.5 GHz) for 5G millimeter-wave communications. Wideband impedance matching is achieved by optimized feed geometry, guaranteeing steady performance over the designated mm-wave frequency range. High port isolation is achieved without intricate decoupling mechanisms, hence minimizing design complexity and preserving a small footprint. The simulation was conducted using the Ansys HFSS electromagnetic solver. The suggested MIMO antenna demonstrates a minimal envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) and substantial diversity gain (DG), and consistent gain patterns, making it an appropriate choice for next-generation high-speed wireless communication systems."

The atomicity principle and different atomic block patterns have been proposed in the past as effective means to counter simple SideChannel Analysis (SCA) attacks. In this work, using our software and hardware implementations as an example, we show that the binary left-to-right kP algorithm with Chevallier-Mames atomic block patterns for point doubling and point addition is vulnerable to simple data-bit SCA attacks. Atomic blocks involving multiplications with special values like 1 are visibly distinguishable. For the right-to-left kP algorithm, this distinguishability is observable only in atomic patterns executed immediately after initialisation. We also show that the well-known randomisation of EC point coordinates, originally designed as a countermeasure against vertical attacks, is also effective against such horizontal data-bit SCA attacks."

Therefore, landslides are one of the geological hazards (Geohazard) in geothermal areas that can impact facilities and local communities. When ground cracks begin to appear, monitoring of ground movement must be carried out immediately to determine the next hazard mitigation steps that need to be taken. Manual measurements carried out directly will pose a danger to workers. With Internet of Things technology, measurements can be done online without the need to come directly to the location where the ground crack occurred. The method and implementation involve using a distance sensor connected to a controller. Data is transmitted via a long-range Wi-Fi network. The received data is integrated with a data logger in real time. In addition to ground movement data, rainfall is also measured as supporting data that may influence ground conditions. Online monitoring is expected to provide real-time data for further analysis and to serve as an early warning system in the event of significant ground movement. Another key objective is to reduce the risk to workers due to the potential danger of landslides when conducting manual measurements."

Among these, gaze tracking stands as a beacon, promising to unlock hands-free control and enhanced user experiences. However, hardware-based eye trackers often compete with the inflated cost and impractical setups of standard hardware-based eye trackers. The present work focuses on the development of an open source gaze estimation system, creating a user-calibrated, real-time focus prediction system based on a commonly available web camera and the robust technology of Google’s MediaPipe Face Mesh pipeline. The proposed solution is based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) models with custom feature engineering that incorporates both facial landmarks and head pose dynamics. The paper details a calibration methodology designed to forge a bespoke mapping for each user, adapting to individual biometric and environmental variations. Furthermore, this work addresses practical implementation considerations, including the crucial step of feature scaling and the process of hyperparameter optimization via exhaustive grid search. The presented results, as illustrated in the accompanying scatter plots, demonstrate the SVR models’ ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships, marking a promising step towards robust and accessible gaze tracking in diverse interactive paradigms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed case study on the improvement of power quality in a 6 kV industrial electrical network through the application of capacitor banks. Industrial facilities operating at medium voltage are often affected by power quality issues such as low power factor, excessive reactive power demand, voltage drops, and high distribution losses. These factors not only reduce the operational efficiency of the electrical network but also increase energy costs and the risk of equipment malfunction. Capacitor banks represent a well-established and cost-effective solution to address such problems by compensating reactive power, stabilizing voltage profiles, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the system.In this study, a 6 kV distribution network supplying an industrial process was analyzed under two conditions: before and after the implementation of capacitor banks. Key performance indicators such as active and reactive power flow, power factor, system losses, and voltage stability were carefully monitored. The analysis revealed that the integration of properly sized capacitor banks significantly improved the power factor, reduced energy losses, and maintained voltage within the recommended limits. These improvements not only enhance the reliability and efficiency of the industrial process but also contribute to lowering operational costs and ensuring compliance with power quality standards. The findings confirm that capacitor banks are an effective and sustainable approach for improving power quality in medium-voltage industrial networks."

    "abstract": "Accurate single cell detection in brightfield microscopy is crucial for biological research, yet data scarcity and annotation bottlenecks limit the progress of deep learning methods. We investigate the use of unconditional models to generate synthetic brightfield microscopy images and evaluate their impact on object detection performance. A U-Net based diffusion model was trained and used to create datasets with varying ratios of synthetic and real images. Experiments with YOLOv8, YOLOv9 and RT-DETR reveal that training with synthetic data can achieve improved detection accuracies (at minimal costs). A human expert survey demonstrates the high realism of generated images, with experts not capable to distinguish them from real microscopy images (accuracy <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$50 {\\%}$</tex>). Our findings suggest that diffusion-based synthetic data generation is a promising avenue for augmenting real datasets in microscopy image analysis, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation and potentially improving the robustness of cell detection models."

Traditional object detection approaches, especially those based on conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often encounter challenges in processing real-time video streams under varying environmental conditions. This research presents an enhanced multi-class vehicle detection framework utilizing Swin Transformers, known for their hierarchical attention mechanisms and robust feature extraction. The proposed system achieves low-latency processing comparable to established models such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and Faster R-CNN. Specifically, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 typically yield 55–60% mean average precision (mAP) on custom datasets, while Faster R-CNN achieves 60–65% mAP. The integration of Swin Transformer with YOLOv5 (custom head) attains 75% mAP, and Swin Transformer combined with Mask R-CNN achieves 70–80% mAP. The standalone Swin Transformer also maintains high detection accuracy. These results indicate the system’s suitability for deployment in smart city infrastructures."

To overcome these limitations, this work proposes the integration of blockchain technology for decentralized and tamper-resistant policy management. A functional prototype combining OpenDaylight, Ethereum smart contracts, and a Node.js middleware was implemented and tested in a Mininet environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that, compared with a traditional centralized SDN controller, the proposed system increases policy registration latency from 45 ms to 210 ms on average and CPU load from 18% to 27%. However, it ensures full traceability, immutability, and resilience of network policies. Moreover, in failure scenarios, policies remain verifiable and enforceable, whereas centralized solutions lose control. These findings confirm that the blockchain-based approach provides improved security and governance at the cost of moderate overhead, making it suitable for critical infrastructures such as 5G and multi-domain networks."

Gathering continuous data from these sensors allows us to generate a complete spatiotemporal field for the desired measurements. However, obtaining continuous sensing data at all locations and times is often infeasible due to resource limits, cost constraints, and practicality. To address this problem, we proposed a Learned Gumbel-Based Active Sparse MCS framework utilizing an Encoder-Decoder Time Series Transformer that reconstructs the full spatiotemporal field for a given time cycle and a small subset of available sensors. Notably, an active sensor selection layer is included, which leverages the Gumbel distribution to create noise from learned weights, helping to dynamically select the most effective sensors for the next sensing cycle. We verified the effectiveness of our proposed model by comparing it to random selection, attention-scoring, and statistical methods. Our Gumbel-Based selector achieves higher performance in both firstand second-order norm metrics."

While most studies focus on public cloud deployments, this work investigates machine learningbased performance prediction in resource-constrained cloud environments. A three-layer monitoring pipeline is proposed: (1) time-series prediction using GRU, TCN, and XGBoost models; (2) anomaly detection through residuals, z-scores, and health scores; and (3) performance classification using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Preprocessing includes RAM-to-percentage conversion, MinMaxScaler normalization for CPU, sliding window creation, and data partitioning. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and residual analysis. A confidence index is introduced to combine prediction accuracy and decision stability over time. Experimental results show that the TCN model achieves the highest confidence index, indicating a strong balance between sensitivity and consistency. GRU and XGBoost are more stable but slower in reacting to anomalies, while the LSTM baseline tends to classify many conditions as uncertain. The entire pipeline is deployed through a Streamlit-based dashboard that visualizes inference results and VM classifications in real time. System usability is tested using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and yields a score of 85, placing the system in the “Excellent” category and indicating high user satisfaction. This study presents a modular and lightweight monitoring framework suitable for adaptive performance management in clouds."

This paper proposes the ASEAN Integrated Network for Early Warning and Tracking (AINET)—an innovative framework combining Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time seismic data collection, Artificial Intelligence (AI) for rapid event analysis, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for dynamic impact visualization and information dissemination. The system is designed with aggressive performance targets, specifically aiming for sub-second data acquisition and processing, enabling multi-second alert delivery to minimize the critical time gap before destructive S-waves arrive. Critically, the study introduces a Digital Business Value Framework that outlines how the technical design generates measurable socio-economic value and financial sustainability, distinguishing it from conventional, purely government-funded EEWS models. This framework leverages principles of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Return on Investment (ROI) by quantifying the value generated from averted losses in infrastructure and human capital across the disaster management cycle. AINET presents a crucial strategic roadmap toward a more resilient, technologically advanced, and economically self-sustaining disaster management ecosystem for the ASEAN region."

The sample of universities that implement training in the field of AI covers all federal districts of the Russian Federation, demonstrating a balanced representation - from the Central (11 universities) to the Far Eastern (4 universities) districts, which ensures the representativeness of the results for the entire system of Russian higher education. The methodology includes systematization and classification of more than 3 thousand disciplines in five key modules: \"Computer Science\", \"Mathematics\", \"Software Engineering\", \"Practices and Certification\" and \"Other Disciplines\". To identify structural patterns, the hierarchical clustering method (Ward’s method) is used, where the input data is the percentage distribution of the academic load between the selected modules. Tile maps, dendrograms and radar diagrams are used to visualize the results of the analysis. Cluster analysis made it possible to identify four stable types of educational programs. The first cluster – theoretical and mathematical – is characterized by a high share of mathematical disciplines (47.6%) and is presented in classical universities. The second cluster – engineering and analytical – demonstrates a balanced combination of mathematics (26.6%) and applied aspects of data analysis (20.9% \"Software Engineering\"). The programs of the third cluster – applied development – are focused on practical skills (36.2% \"Software Engineering\"). The fourth cluster – innovative and technological – integrates advanced AI technologies (25.2% \"Computer Science\") with an interdisciplinary approach.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of smart vehicles equipped with advanced computing capabilities has enabled collaborative computing among vehicles, particularly through vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading, also known as peercloud-vehicle. However, the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of vehicular environments presents significant security challenges, especially in trust management. Untrustworthy vehicles can cause unreliable task execution and introduce security vulnerabilities, ultimately compromising the efficiency and security of vehicle-to-vehicle offloading. To address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive trust management framework for vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading scenarios. The framework is designed to assess the trustworthiness of vehicles in order to enhance task offloading success rates by avoiding interactions with low-trust vehicles. Specifically, the framework includes two key components. First, we propose a decentralized trust propagation and aggregation mechanism that can adapt to the dynamic nature of vehicular environments. Second, we propose a trust-aware task allocation approach that integrates trust estimation with resource management to optimize task execution. Experimental results on both realworld and synthetic vehicular network datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework enables secure and efficient vehicle-to-vehicle task offloading by accurately estimating trust and significantly improving workload completion performance."

A few studies of the vertical gradient of cardon dioxide were conducted from airplane that offer poor vertical resolution and from towers that are available at limited locations. Recent developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV, i.e. drone) made it possible to carry physical and chemical sensors on a UAV to different altitudes for determining gradient of physical and chemical parameters. Here, we present some vertical profiles of carbon dioxide, water vapor, temperature, and relative humidity determined at: the Moana Loa Observatory, Hawaii; aboard R/V Kilo Moana at ALOHA Station in the North Pacific Ocean; Cape Hatteras, North Carolina; and Spruill Farm Conservation Project, North Carolina. Vertical profiles were observed at each site, and these vertical profiles of carbon dioxide were used to estimate near surface gradients of carbon dioxide. The gradient measured indicates that Mauna Loa is a source of carbon, the Spruill Farm and ALOHA Station is a sink of carbon, while Cape Hatteras is a source of carbon a few observation days and a sink of carbon most the other days during the study period."

Our method reformulates free-form queries into structured CLIP-aligned prompts, extracting key roles and filtering negations before injecting them into LERF. Experiments on descriptive, affordance, and negation benchmarks show clear improvements, achieving 95% accuracy on affordance queries and 88 % on negation handling over baseline LERF. IntentFuse enables intuitive, training-free, plug-andplay affordance grounding with applications in real-time robotic instruction following and AR/VR scene exploration, paving the way for more natural and interpretable human-environment interaction."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) by enabling real-time monitoring, predictive health assessment, and personalised support. However, the adoption of AI in AAL is hindered by lack of transparency, potential biases, and limited interpretability. This paper introduces $\\mathbf{M}^{\\mathbf{3}} \\mathbf{X}$-AAL-a Multimodal, Multi-tier, Meta-explainability framework designed to enhance trust and understanding in AI-powered AAL systems. The framework integrates diverse data modalities (numerical, textual, and visual) and provides explanations at three hierarchical levels: Tier 1 delivers local and global insights specific to each modality; Tier 2 contextualises these explanations with metadata to identify biases and subgroupspecific patterns; and Tier 3 monitors temporal evolution to detect concept drift and maintain fairness over time. By combining SHAP, word cloud analysis, and Grad-CAM visualisations, $\\mathrm{M}^{3} \\mathrm{X}$-AAL offers comprehensive interpretability for technical experts, domain specialists, and end-users alike. Experimental results demonstrate the framework’s ability to improve transparency, fairness, and trustworthiness in safety-critical AAL environments."

However, their unstructured narratives hinder systematic analysis and reuse. To address this challenge, we introduce AKG-Gen, a framework for generating knowledge graphs from air accident reports with LLM-powered prompting. AKG-Gen adopts a hierarchical extraction strategy that leverages large language models to construct an extended quintuple representation incorporating both event and time. It further applies sectionlevel and integration-level prompts for layered knowledge extraction and employs a fusion mechanism to mitigate entity fragmentation and relation redundancy. Experiments on realworld reports demonstrate that AKG-Gen achieves substantial improvements in efficiency, fusion quality, and knowledge coverage compared with manual extraction, thereby enabling systematic accident cause analysis and supporting datadriven decision-making in aviation safety."

However, its unique device structure introduces new reliability challenges. This work investigates the role of substrate biasing on BDS lifetime. Experimental results show that devices with a floating substrate exhibit catastrophic failure within ~30 minutes of operation, while those with the substrate tied to the low-side source remain stable for more than 1000 hours. TCAD simulations reveal that under floating conditions the substrate self-biases to a positive potential, leading to intensified electric fields at the gate side of the device. This localized field intensification provides a direct explanation for the reported lifetime reduction. These results demonstrate that proper substrate biasing is essential for reliable operation of optimized BDS and point to dynamic clamping to the lowest source potential as the preferred solution for the studied device architecture."

In the second step, the shape of the PMs was optimized to ensure that the new motor produces the same torque as the initial PMSM. Finally, other optimization criteria were used to enhance the torque-magnet volume ratio of the newly designed PMSM.

In this paper, we investigate speech synthesis using the HiFi-GAN vocoder in conjunction with the Tacotron2 model. HiFi-GAN converts the mel-spectrograms produced by the sequence-to-sequence model Tacotron2 into high-fidelity audio waveforms. Using the LJSpeech dataset for training, we show how to apply these models. With an emphasis on the generated speech’s temporal coherence and perceptual quality, the synthesized audio is assessed both subjectively and objectively. The study also examines how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can improve the synthesis process in TTS systems, resulting in high-quality, real-time performance. Comparing the combined Tacotron2 and HiFi-GAN approach to earlier techniques, experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in speech synthesis naturalness. Future developments in TTS systems, such as possible additions to multilingual synthesis and voice style transfer, are covered in the paper’s conclusion. Our system achieved a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 4.2/5 across 10 listeners (aged 18–25), with synthesis time averaging less than 2 seconds per sentence. Objective metrics such as Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) further confirm improvements over baseline model"

The basic ideology relies on a newly established time-transformation method that incorporates the classical adaptive technique, converting the prescribed-time stable control problem of the original system into an asymptotically stable problem of its time-transformed stretched form. Unlike the existing literature, the time transformation method in this article directly gives the adaptive laws before and after the time transformation, which greatly reduces the complexity of designing the adaptive prescribed-time controller due to the fact that the design of the adaptive law in the stretched time domain only needs to satisfy the asymptotic stability criterion. Finally, the proposed methodology is validated by a simulation example."

By embedding passive dry electrodes into the proposed AR headset in contact areas such as the occipital area, brow ridge, and cheeks, the system can simultaneously record electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and facial electromyography (fEMG) data. The acquired multimodal biosignals were utilized to implement a steady-state visual evoked potential-based brain–computer interface (BCI), an eye-writing pattern recognition system, a facial expression recognition system, and a silent speech recognition system.

This architecture integrates ferroelectric polarization and charge-trapping mechanisms within a tri-gate nanowire (fin) structure to achieve normally-off operation. Unlike conventional planar HEMTs, the tri-gate configuration exposes the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel along the fin sidewalls, enabling effective depletion through trapped charges in the CTL, thereby achieving a high and stable threshold voltage (VTH). There is a possibility that incorporating fluorine into the HfO2 layer reduces oxygen vacancies and dangling bonds, significantly improving the dielectric interface and device reliability. At the dielectric/semiconductor interface, the interface trap density (Dit) was estimated to be 1×1011 to 1.2×1013 cm-2∙eV-1, as extracted using the frequency-dependent conductance method. The tri-gate device demonstrates an impressive VTH of 4.4 ± 0.2 V, IDS-MAX of 946 ± 10 mA/mm, breakdown voltage (BV) of 768 V, and a high-power figure-of-merit (PFOM) of 973 MW/cm2.

To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative radio-frequency (RF) detection and localization framework that leverages existing cellular base stations (BSs). The proposed approach features a robust scheme for LSS target identification, integrating a cell averaging-constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector with a micro- Doppler signature (MDS) based recognition method. Multi-station measurements are fused through a grid-based probabilistic algorithm combined with clustering techniques, effectively mitigating ghost targets and improving localization accuracy in multi-UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a performance benchmark and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization is employed to balance localization accuracy against involved BS number. Simulation results demonstrate that increasing from one to multiple BSs can reduce the positioning error to near the CRLB, while practical experiments further verify the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based optimization can maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource usage, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for ensuring airspace safety in the emerging low-altitude economy."

This issue is particularly critical for safety-critical real-time applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by dynamically updating model parameters during inference without requiring source data or pre-collected target samples. However, existing TTA methods mainly target image classification, while their extension to object detection remains limited and is hindered by noisy pseudo-labels. To tackle this, we introduce a dynamic adaptive IoU thresholding mechanism that combines IoU across consecutive iterations (IoU-CI) and IoU among overlapping detections (IoU-OD). We further design a dynamic threshold adjustment strategy guided by iteration progress, detection confidence, and prediction uncertainty, enabling adaptive filtering and improved pseudo-label quality. Extensive experiments on multiple artistic-style datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-theart TTA baselines, boosting detection performance by over 4 mAP points (e.g., $23.17 \\%$ on Comic2k), and significantly enhancing pseudo-label reliability."

Recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly within the \"learning to optimize\" framework, have enabled fast and efficient approximations of ORPD solutions, typically by training models on precomputed optimization results. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance on synthetic datasets, their effectiveness under real-world grid conditions remains largely unexplored. This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce a publicly available power system dataset that includes both the structural characteristics of a complete nation’s electrical grid (Uruguay), as well as nearly two years of real-world operational data, encompassing actual demand and generation profiles. Given Uruguay’s high penetration of renewable energy in this network, the ORPD problem has become the primary optimization challenge in its operation. Equipped with this data, and as a second contribution, we assess the impact of these real-world inputs on ML-based ORPD solutions, revealing a significant increase in prediction errors when transitioning from synthetic to actual demand and generation profiles. Our results highlight the limitations of existing models in learning under the complex statistical properties of real grid conditions and emphasize the need for more expressive architectures. By providing this dataset and the associated code, we aim to facilitate further research into robust ML-based optimization techniques for power system management."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel predictive wellness analytics framework that integrates human activity recognition (HAR) sensor data with large language model (LLM) extracted behavioral context for personalized health interventions. Our hybrid pipeline combines the WISDM accelerometer dataset with contextual features derived from natural language wellness logs, enabling both accurate activity classification and personalized recommendation generation. The proposed late-fusion architecture achieves 98.2% accuracy for core activity recognition (Walking, Jogging, Sitting, Standing) while simultaneously providing contextually aware wellness recommendations. Through controlled experimental validation using synthetic wellness narratives, we demonstrate that incorporating LLM-extracted behavioral features (sleep patterns, fatigue levels, activity goals) significantly enhances the personalization capabilities of traditional sensor-based wellness systems. This work establishes a technical foundation for intelligent digital health assistants that bridges the gap between objective sensor measurements and subjective wellness experiences, while identifying critical research directions for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "The incorporation of Autonomous electric vehicles (EV) into smart cities offers substantial advantages for transportation and energy management. However, it also instigates new security challenges distinctly from Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks which leads to disruption of network operations. In order to mitigate, prevent and detect DDoS attacks in autonomous EV networks, we proposed SafEV a Machine Learning (ML)-based framework using various ML models such as K-nearest Neighbour (KNN), Logistics Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) and the SVM was found to be the most accurate classifier among them, distinguishing DDoS attacks with an accuracy of $95.50 \\%$. The model’s efficiency and accuracy demonstrates realtime attack detection and mitigation. To evaluate the SafEV framework’s efficiency, we use several performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1 -score, PR and ROC curves, which further emphasises the robustness and resilience of the system. The proposed SafEV framework provides an efficient method for sheltering Autonomous EV Networks, ensuring trustworthy and cautious operations within smart cities. Furthermore, to enhance the security and productivity of transportation and energy systems, it precisely detects malicious activities."

    "abstract": "In oilfield production optimization, water flooding is a key technique to enhance recovery, and its seepage process is commonly modeled by the Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation. However, under planar radial flow conditions, the BL equation is challenging to solve due to its hyperbolic nature and shock formation. Traditional numerical methods are constrained by numerical dissipation and high computational costs, limiting predictive accuracy, while conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from unstable convergence near shocks, leading to poor accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a PINN framework integrated with a gated attention mechanism (Gated Attention-PINN). By introducing gated attention modules, the method strengthens feature interactions, significantly improves shock-capturing capability and convergence stability, and further enhances model interpretability. This work not only extends the applicability of PINNs to radial flow simulations but also provides a high-accuracy, stable, and interpretable tool for complex multiphase flow modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that Gated AttentionPINN outperforms standard PINN in both accuracy and convergence speed, achieving a 65% reduction in mean squared error and an increase in $R^{2}$ to over $95 \\%$."

    "abstract": "To address the issues of false positives and suboptimal detection performance due to a limited number of belt defect samples in existing belt defect detection methods, this paper proposes a belt defect detection method based on an improved unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN). This method primarily trains the model using images of defect-free belts, calculates outliers in the test set images, and distinguishes whether the samples have defects. The method combines an encoder and replaces its standard convolutions with depthwise separable convolutions to reduce detection time. In the discriminator, spectral norm normalization is used to stabilize model training. During the detection phase, the outlier calculation formula is improved, and the weighting of each loss component is redistributed to enhance detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy (A) of the model on the belt data set is 98.67%, the probability of correct judgment of the value of the defective sample is higher than that of the normal sample (AUC) is 99.88%, and the average accuracy (AP) is 99.71%., outperforming the detection performance of DCGAN and f-AnoGAN under equivalent conditions. Additionally, the average detection time is reduced by 2.70% compared to f-AnoGAN. The experiments demonstrate that the improved algorithm achieves good results in belt defect detection."

We formulate a Multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes task delay and energy consumption, thereby providing a set of Pareto-optimal solutions for practical deployment. To efficiently explore the highdimensional decision space, a group-based encoding strategy is proposed to reduce variable dimensionality. On this basis, we develop a hybrid optimization algorithm that integrates MultiObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)-assisted prediction mechanism, and an Adaptive Expansion Sampling (AES) strategy. The MOPSO framework serves as the global optimizer, while the BPNN module leverages learned task-performance mappings to predict convergence directions, and AES adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to single-objective optimization and weighted-sum methods, the proposed approach achieves superior trade-offs between latency and energy consumption, faster convergence speed, and better solution diversity. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed framework for efficient resource optimization in next-generation cloud-edge-terminal collaborative systems."

This algorithm adopts Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering to replace the manual initialization process of Gaussian membership function, and adaptively generates the membership degree distribution of the rule antecedent through a data-driven approach. It retains the mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD), L2 regularization, DropRule and AdaBound optimization strategies of the original algorithm, forming a TSK fuzzy system training framework with both adaptive rule generation and efficient parameter optimization. Experiments on 4 standard regression datasets show that FC-MBGD-RDA achieves a lower average test RMSE compared to the original MBGD-RDA. It converges faster on high-dimensional datasets and exhibits stronger robustness against hyperparameter variations."

Traditionally pruning methods used weight ranking techniques and magnitude penalties to rate weights for later removal during the retraining phase of surviving weights. The process of network size reduction through neuron removal from the network forms part of pruning strategies. The weight selection process forms an optimization problem which aims to find specific weights that minimize misclassifications. The system has two new mechanisms for weight updating through chaos stimulation and it identifies causal weights that generate misclassifications. The network that undergoes pruning achieves its performance level with no reduction in explainability."

It supports independent, affordable yoga practices without expert supervision using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The proposed system uses webcam input to extract 33 body key points through the structure of mediapipe posture assessment. These traits can be categorized into five yoga poses, like downward dog, tree, warrior, plank and goddess pose etc using several controlled teaching methods. Among the assessed classifiers, the Support Vector Machines model reached the highest performance with 98% accuracy prior to Random Forest (97%), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (63%), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (28%). The SVM model is integrated into a flask based web application and provides real time feedback, user authentication, session monitoring, and personalized progress monitoring. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system to ensure accurate recognition of posture while maintaining simple deployment, highlighting its potential as a digital wellness tool that provides accessible and personalized experts for yoga support."

The antenna structure comprises inverted-L elements, parasitic branches, and a ground plane. Through innovative design approaches including optimized inverted-L antenna stub width and parasitic element slotting techniques, the system successfully achieves coverage across four frequency bands while effectively minimizing the overall antenna dimensions.

While colonoscopy remains the clinical gold standard for detection, at the same time, manual polyp segmentation introduces subjectivity and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this study presents the use of deep learning models PolypPVT, TransUNet, and Fine-Tuned UNet for automated polyp segmentation. Each model is evaluated under uniform training, augmentation, and evaluation conditions using the publicly available Kvasir-Seg dataset, which comprises 1000 annotated colonoscopy images. PolypPVT with Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) encoder achieved higher outcomes with Dice 0.94 and IoU 0.89. And a hybrid convolution-transformer model, TransUNet, obtains a Dice score of 0.91 and an IoU of 0.86. A refined UNet model with ResNet34 backbone with the scSE attention mechanism trails with a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.83. Results show that transformer-based models are more effective at capturing feature representation and enforcing boundary precision. The performance comparisons are also subject to visual overlays and learning curves.

    "abstract": "Power failures and losses of the telecommunication network in disaster-prone areas negatively impact the response time for emergency operations, the provision of medical attention, and the coordination of the improvement unit. The conventional approaches to restoring connectivity, such as ground repair teams and the implementation of backup generators, are slow, resource-intensive, and hindered by access issues in numerous distant locations or places characterised by danger. The above constraints create a strong demand for a rapid adaptation and a swift, technology-oriented solution to bridge the significant gap between infrastructural downtime and complete revival. In resolving this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework that utilises an AI swarm of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with wireless power beaming technology, enabling the restoration of evanescent energy and real-time connectivity. It incorporates a swarm coordination algorithm, which utilises common forms of reinforcement, allowing drones to autonomously manage flight paths, allocate available power during dynamic changes in priority locations such as communication towers and hospitals, and adapt to changing demands and environmental factors. Wireless power beaming modules ensure that necessary facilities become operable again without the need for direct physical repair. At the same time, swarm intelligence ensures system redundancy and resilience, even in the event of drone failure. Simulation investigations in disaster conditions demonstrate that the proposed solution can decrease recovery time by over 60 per cent compared to traditional solutions, significantly increase power provision efficiency over the medium term, and offer a scalable solution with coverage across multiple facilities simultaneously. The framework ensures that lifelines essential to critical operations are not shut down at the time when they are needed most, just after a disaster, by concentrating on selective recovery to bring essential life support systems back online, in addition to the recovery of the entire grid. The findings indicate that AI-controlled swarms of drones are not only a cost-efficient and scalable solution but also an innovative approach to emergencies, as autonomous aerial systems become the bridge between the destruction of facilities and human survival."

Employing a mixed-methods approach, specifically an explanatory sequential design, the study first gathered quantitative data to identify trends in CSE among blind users, followed by qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews that explore experiences, highlighting the intersection of gender and CSE. This disparity is further explored in the qualitative phase, which uncovers factors contributing to the lower CSE among female blind users, including reduced familiarity with assistive technologies, limited previous internet use, and fewer opportunities for digital literacy training. The findings suggest that female blind users face more significant barriers to developing CSE, causing a gender digital divide. Access, lack of digital literacy programs, and tailored assistive technology training emerge as critical factors influencing CSE, particularly for women. By combining statistical trends with in-depth personal narratives, the study highlights the need for gender-sensitive interventions that support equitable digital inclusion for them."

    "abstract": "The increase in pathological foot conditions such as flat foot, and high arch foot leads to associated complications, amputations and morbidity that could result in a substantial increase in treatment costs. The prognosis of these deformities is clinically identified using plantar pressure maps from commercial setups is highly accurate, but was found to persist limited applicability due to lack of mobility and affordability. To address these challenges, a portable plantar pressure measurement setup has been developed and named as Portable Plantar Image Acquisition (PPIA) setup. This setup is able to capture a sequence of images during the stance phase of participants involved in the study. Furthermore, the analysis of the collected data is conducted from state-of-the art AI models involving Unet segmentation model [1] and the K-means clustering algorithm, differing from the previously explored portable setups. The study was conducted on 51 participants, including healthy and pathological feet involving flat and high arch conditions. The developed PPIA setup has achieved excellent results in mimicking the results of commercial systems for (1) foot type classification, with an accuracy of $92.15 \\%$, a precision of $83.38 \\%$, and a recall of $81.44 \\%$, and (2) plantar pressure distribution with mean squared error (MSE) values of $\\mathbf{1. 4 0 ~ f o r ~ t h e ~ f o r e f o o t ~ (F), ~} \\mathbf{1. 4 8}$ for the midfoot (M), and 3.02 for the heel (H) regions, respectively. The decision-making process of healthcare professionals is expected to be aided by the PPIA setup and AI-based module with the same effectiveness as commercial systems."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a crucial role in intelligent communication systems, as it enables reliable identification of signal types under diverse channel conditions. In this work, we propose a novel method, Wavelet-Enhanced Vision Transformer (WTViT), which integrates the multi-resolution analysis capability of wavelet transform with the powerful sequence modeling ability of Vision Transformer. By employing a wavelet transform convolution module, rich multi-scale time-frequency features of signals are effectively extracted, which are then processed by a Transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies and complex global structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used RadioML 2018.01A dataset and a self-constructed supplementary dataset with broader modulation categories. The results demonstrate that WTViT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of $95.54 \\%$ and $97.96 \\%$, respectively, thereby confirming its robustness and strong generalization ability for AMC tasks."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication aims to improve the efficiency of data transmission by focusing on meaning rather than exact signal reconstruction. This paper proposes an adaptive semantic communication system that dynamically adjusts the encoding strategy based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, we employ a deep neural encoder-decoder pipeline for the MNIST dataset, selectively applying compression and denoising based on SNR levels. Our experiments show that, for MNIST the reconstructed image has 94% classification accuracy even under compression rate of 0.1, for CIFAR-10 the reconstructed images are acceptable at 0.7 compression which saves 30% of data usage in image transferring. The proposed method is designed with vehicular networks in mind, where wireless channels are highly dynamic due to rapid mobility and frequent topology changes. Our system is salient when bandwidth is limited and unstable which is constantly occurring between vehicles and infrastructure."

It proposes an approach that combines the classical method of determining the critical path (prescriptive scheduling) and a specialized genetic algorithm for dynamic resource optimization. The genetic algorithm shifts noncritical tasks within their slack time to minimize the need for expensive subcontractors while meeting the project deadline. The model encodes potential schedule shifts as chromosomes and uses a fitness function to minimize subcontracting costs. The results demonstrate that this combined method provides a flexible and effective decision support tool for optimizing both project schedules and resource allocation."

This paper introduces a cost-effective microcontrollerbased smart home system that integrates lighting, fan, and airconditioning control into a unified platform. By leveraging realtime sensor data and user input, the system dynamically adjusts appliances to balance comfort with energy savings. Unlike solutions requiring cloud connectivity or complex AI frameworks, the proposed approach uses a standalone Arduino-based controller and simple control logic to achieve intelligent automation. This simplicity allows significant energy savings-reducing lighting and HVAC power consumption comparable to more complex AI-driven systems yet attainable with low-cost, readily available components. The novelty of the system lies in its holistic integration of multi-appliance control under a single microcontroller with adaptive, user-centric operation. The proposed system has significant implications for resource-constrained regions by enabling affordable, sustainable automation that reduces electricity costs and improves user comfort without the need for expensive infrastructure. The result is a scalable and practical smart home solution that advances accessibility, sustainability, and comfort."

However, the high computational cost of training candidate architectures greatly limits the efficiency of conventional approaches. This paper proposes GLC-NAS, a novel NAS method that employs Tournament Learning Competitive Swarm Optimization (TLCSO) with a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based surrogate model. Within GLCNAS, a TLCSO method is proposed to improve optimization performance by incorporating tournament selection, local search, elitism strategies, and competition-driven learning. In addition, to mitigate the need for extensive training and alleviate computational bottlenecks, a GNN predictor is employed as an evaluation module during the TLCSO search process, thereby enabling efficient and reliable performance estimation for candidate architectures. The experimental results in the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that GLCNAS reduces search time from several days to only minutes. GLC-NAS achieves faster convergence and identifies superior architectures, providing an efficient and practical solution for the design of automated neural architectures."

    "abstract": "In recent years, network traffic analysis solutions that are driven by artificial intelligence models have achieved impressive performance. The “magic spells” of these solutions come from the knowledge that they learn from large amounts of network traffic data. However, these solutions neglect the impact of the real-world network's complexity on data quality, which makes the knowledge they learn from regular network traffic data difficult to be effective on low-quality data. Considering the packet loss in real-world network environments, this paper presents TFMana to calibrate the inaccurate packet length features extracted from incomplete network traffic data. TFMana utilizes an encoder-based masked language model to predict features of lost packets, incorporating network traffic feature embeddings to enhance prediction accuracy. This approach enables the calibrated features to approximate those extracted from loss-free network traffic asymptotically. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The evaluation demonstrates that TFMana's calibration achieves recovery accuracy between 83.94 % and 85.66 %, with minimal sensitivity to packet loss rates. Integrated with four benchmark application identification models, TFMana significantly improves classification accuracy under packet loss conditions. Notably, the analysis models maintains reliable performance even at high packet loss rates of 30 %."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles changing urban traffic raises challenges for guaranteeing their and EVs’ safety and smooth operations in urgent situations. The SmartAV-RescueSense system is presented here as a multi-sensor and artificial intelligence framework made to help AVs notice and answer to emergency vehicles right away. With the help of its new fusion engine, the system combines microphone signals from different directions and all-around cameras to properly sense sirens and emergency signs, regardless of whether it’s noisy or hard to see. Because of the module, emergency signals are quickly recognized and the system functions well without the need for online storage or processing. Besides, the platform uses the Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) protocol to obtain live warnings from equipped emergency vehicles, allowing AVs to act safely and efficiently. Thanks to its reinforcement learning structure, the dynamic path model directs AVs to give way or change their route in the best way given the situation and the urban environment. The approach also makes use of mapped priority regions over time to anticipate the route of an emergency vehicle in a busy city grid. Simulations of many different emergencies at the same time confirm that the system works well and responds promptly. It shows that this method represents considerable advantages in accuracy, time for response, and safety over older technologies. thanks to this research, urban traffic safety is increasing and these cars can live side by side smoothly. Those trying to improve these systems will increasingly focus on significant, real-life experiments and fitting them into city infrastructure."

The results indicate that while IP-based architectures remain dominant due to their ubiquity and stability, they face growing challenges in areas such as Internet of Things (IoT) scalability, mobility, and security. Non-IP architectures, particularly ICN/NDN, offer built-in security mechanisms, efficient content distribution, and enhanced mobility support, yet they face significant challenges related to compatibility and ecosystem maturity. The comparative analysis emphasizes that the future of networking will likely involve hybrid models and the gradual adoption of non-IP paradigms in niche domains before broader acceptance."

Traditional cognitive diagnostic models usually analyze the linear relationship between students and exercises by manually designing functions, but this approach is difficult to adequately capture the rich content closely related to foreign language exercises. To address this problem, this paper proposes a generalized cognitive diagnosis model called the Attention Cognitive Diagnosis Kolmogorov-Arnold Net (ACDKAN). This model incorporates advanced modules from the field of machine vision. It extends the Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to ensure the interpretability of factor vectors and to effectively explore the semantic information within foreign language exercises. By studying the precedence relations between knowledge concepts, ACDKAN reveals the complexity of targeted knowledge concepts and enhances the learning ability of exercise feature vectors. Experimental results based on real foreign language exercises datasets show that ACDKAN model proposed in the paper outperforms other advanced cognitive diagnostic methods."

The dataset contains images of six guava diseases named Red Rust, Phytophthora, Stylar End Rot, Anthracnose, Scab, and Fruit Fly as well as healthy guavas. Several image preprocessing was to improve the model generalization. In this paper, EfficientNet-B3 model achieved a classification accuracy of $99 \\%$. Additionally, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were used to validate the model’s performance across different disease categories. Comparing manual disease inspection, this automated system reduces human effort, enhances diagnostic accuracy, and can be deployed in real-world agricultural applications, including smartphone-based disease detection tools and precision farming solutions.

The results showed an average score of 4.69, which falls into the \"very good\" category. Among respondents, 88% agreed that the interface was easy to use, another 88% found the attendance process smooth, 94% felt the information displayed was clear, and 88% stated that the system responded quickly. From these results, it can be concluded that the application performs effectively and is positively received by its users. In practice, it provides a reliable and modern approach to attendance management while also supporting higher employee engagement and consistency in daily work routines."

Prototypes were fabricated on FR-4, RT/Duroid 5880, and Rogers RO3210 substrates, each realized in parallel with intact and defected ground planes. Measured results confirmed the simulations, showing that DGS introduces additional transmission zeros, enhances stopband attenuation by up to 30 dB, and improves selectivity with limited insertion loss penalty. Substrate properties were found to significantly influence matching, bandwidth, and quality factor, while maintaining mechanical stability above 12 GHz. The outcomes demonstrate that integrating DGS into microstrip filters provides a cost-effective strategy for miniaturization and performance enhancement, ensuring suitability for compact RF front ends in emerging 5G/6G wireless communication systems."

While many maintain incident response plans (IRPs) to meet regulatory requirements, these plans are often untested and poorly integrated into operational workflows, resulting in delayed containment, unclear escalation, and inconsistent response actions. This disconnect between documentation and execution representing a critical readiness gap that can significantly increase the impact and duration of cyber events. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Incident Response Readiness Score (IRRS); a scenario-based assessment framework designed to empirically evaluate an organisation's incident response capability under simulated conditions. The IRRS applies a structured scoring rubric calibrated through a Scenario Risk Index, enabling proportional evaluation of performance across diverse incident types. By transforming qualitative incident response actions into a reproducible and risk-weighted metric, the IRRS offers a practical and scalable means of assessing and improving cybersecurity readiness for different type organisations."

State-of-the-art physics-informed neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We investigate physicsinformed neural operator learning models as efficient supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet) on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operatorsupervised approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766 vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization coefficient and decreasing training overhead by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 \\%}$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Variational methods are widely used in the meteorological community to retrieve 3D-wind from single LiDAR observations, but the weights for loss function components are static and determined empirically, and iteratively minimizing the loss function is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method, the Model Function-based Multi-Regularization parameter selection with Adaptive Weights (MFMR-AW) for the background field components to overcome these challenges. MFMR-AW employs the multi-parameter regularization method to combine the Lidar observations with the background field. The combined effect of MFMR and AW determines the weights of background field components. Then the variational principle is used to transform the function minimization process into a system of linear equations, which can be well handled with the truncated singular value decomposition method. Simulations and field observations are employed to validate the proposed method. Results show that the mean RMSEs of MFMR-AW can be reduced by up to 66.9% compared to traditional assumption-based background fields, and the proposed method can get comparable or even superior accuracy with only about 1% of the computation cost of the traditional variational method."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image restoration (RSIR) is essential for recovering high-fidelity imagery from degraded observations, enabling accurate downstream analysis. However, most existing methods focus on single degradation types within homogeneous data, restricting their practicality in real-world scenarios where multiple degradations often across diverse spectral bands or sensor modalities, creating a significant operational bottleneck. To address this fundamental gap, we propose TGPNet, a unified framework capable of handling denoising, cloud removal, shadow removal, deblurring, and SAR despeckling within a single, unified architecture. The core of our framework is a novel Task-Guided Prompting (TGP) strategy. TGP leverages learnable, task-specific embeddings to generate degradation-aware cues, which then hierarchically modulate features throughout the decoder. This task-adaptive mechanism allows the network to precisely tailor its restoration process for distinct degradation patterns while maintaining a single set of shared weights. To validate our framework, we construct a unified RSIR benchmark covering RGB, multispectral, SAR, and thermal infrared modalities for five aforementioned restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TGPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both unified multi-task scenarios and unseen composite degradations, surpassing even specialized models in individual domains such as cloud removal. By successfully unifying heterogeneous degradation removal within a single adaptive framework, this work presents a significant advancement for multi-task RSIR, offering a practical and scalable solution for operational pipelines. The code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/huangwenwenlili/TGPNet."

    "abstract": "In OFDM wireless communications, power amplifier nonlinearity generates significant out-of-band (OOB) emissions and in-band distortion, conventionally requiring large power back-offs to address both issues simultaneously. We propose a forward distortion compensation (FDC) scheme using amplitude-phase-frequency block modulation (APFBM) that decouples OOB emission suppression from in-band distortion management, enabling reliable transmission even under severe power amplifier nonlinearity. At the transmitter, in-band distortion is intentionally introduced to facilitate aggressive OOB emission suppression, while APFBM manages bit mapping and imposes a power-sum constraint on information-carrying subcarriers. At the receiver, this power-sum constraint guides the compensation for in-band distortion, ensuring reliable information recovery. This compensation strategy also relaxes digital pre-distortion (DPD) accuracy requirements, permitting a simpler Sigmoid-based static DPD focused solely on OOB suppression and eliminating feedback circuits. The experimental results show a relative gain of 4.4 dB with a power back-off of 5.2 dB compared to nonlinear transmission based on quadrature amplitude modulation with equivalent processing at 4.9 GHz, while a relative gain of 2.6 dB is achieved at 26.5 GHz. This approach achieves superior energy efficiency and spectral efficiency trade-offs, enhancing coverage and performance in wireless communications."

    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) plays a vital role in human-computer interaction for consumer electronics. However, a key challenge to the practical deployment of current MER methods is the presence of varying noise levels and potential conflicts among modalities. Moreover, existing multimodal learning approaches usually evaluate modality quality from a global perspective, overlooking the inherent data quality biases present across different modalities. To this end, a multimodal adaptive reweighting strategy (Mars) is proposed, which combines an uncertainty weighting mechanism with a staged training framework for reliable multimodal fusion. Specifically, the proposed uncertainty weighting mechanism computes a dynamically scaled loss for each sample pair, enabling the model to automatically prioritize information from more reliable modalities while de-emphasizing less reliable ones from a sample perspective. The staged training framework initially emphasizes learning from the global sample distribution and gradually shifts focus to high-quality samples in later stages, thereby mitigating overfitting. This approach enhances the robustness of each modality and improves overall MER performance. Experimental results show that Mars outperforms baseline methods by 4.6% and 6.07% on the RAVDESS and FETE datasets, respectively, without introducing additional model parameters. The code of Mars is available at: https://github.com/AI-touch/Mars."

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Bangla TTS research to date, tracing the progression from traditional concatenative and parametric methods to most modern end-to-end neural frameworks, including autoregressive models (e.g., Tacotron), non-autoregressive models (e.g., FastSpeech 2), flow- and GAN-based architectures (e.g., VITS - Variational Inference TTS), diffusion-based approaches, and conversational systems such as ChatTTS.We synthesize insights from 13 state-of-the-art models to compare their architectural designs, prosody and speaker-control mechanisms, multilingual capabilities, and practical strengths and limitations. Finally, we provide a detailed overview of publicly available Bangla speech datasets, including the Bangla Speech Corpus, SUBESCO, Common Voice (Bangla), and SHRUTI Bengali, evaluating their suitability for expressive and high-quality speech synthesis. Open issues discussed include emotion modeling, addressing code-mixing, resource constraints, and issues of a lack of linguistic resources. This survey is not only a hefty review of the current pace/state of research, but it also identifies high-priority challenges, and valuable opportunities in the future, putting us on the pathway toward a more natural, expressive, and accessible Bangla Text-to-Speech system."

    "abstract": "In low-altitude environment, the clutter heterogeneity caused by multipath seriously affects the clutter suppression performance of Space-time adaptive processing (STAP). A robust Direct Data Domain approach, using sparse recovery (D3-SR) STAP is proposed to realize robust clutter suppression under the multipath effect. Firstly, the D3-SR method is proposed to get a high-resolution clutter power spectrum, which effectively obtains spectrum estimation under the condition of minimal training samples. By setting a smoothing adaptive subspace, the Focal Underdetermined System Solver (FUSS) algorithm, which is used as the iterative algorithm in the D3-SR method, is improved to reduce the computational error and computational complexity. Then, the clutter covariance matrix (CCM) is obtained by the high-resolution clutter power spectrum of the improved D3-SR method, which solves the training sample shortage under the multipath effect. Based on the improved D3-SR method, the robust D3-SR-STAP is proposed to solve the target steering vector mismatch in STAP caused by the reflected signal of the multipath. By setting two-dimensional magnitude-phase constraints around the target angle-Doppler two-dimensional plain, the mainlobe of the STAP adaptive beamformer is maintained. This can effectively improve the STAP performance under the multipath effect in low-altitude environment. Simulation results validate the effectiveness that the robust STAP can achieve great performance of clutter suppression under the multipath effect."

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of low-altitude economy, the demand for highly reliable uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has become increasingly urgent. Traditional terrestrial communication technologies face significant deficiency in addressing the aerial and moving features of UAVs, while the integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTNs) have emerged as a promising solution for low-altitude communications by combining the pros of satellite and terrestrial systems. This article first presents the limitations of terrestrial networks in meeting UAV traffic demands and coverage requirements. Then, critical design issues confronted by ISTNs are covered, including multi-dimensional resource management, multi-layer cooperative beamforming, handover, and sensing-assisted communications, aiming to ensure seamless wide-area coverage and improve communication reliability for UAVs. Finally, we discuss the remaining open problems in ISTN-based UAV communications."

    "abstract": "Quantum communication systems support unique applications in the form of distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and several cryptographic protocols. The main enabler in these communication systems is an efficient infrastructure that is capable to transport unknown quantum states with high rate and fidelity. This feat requires a new approach to communication system design which efficiently exploits the available physical layer resources, while respecting the limitations and principles of quantum information. Despite the fundamental differences between the classic and quantum worlds, there exist universal communication concepts that may proven beneficial in quantum communication systems as well. In this survey, the distinctive aspects of physical layer quantum communications are highlighted in a attempt to draw commonalities and divergences between classic and quantum communications. More specifically, we begin by overviewing the quantum channels and use cases over diverse optical propagation media, shedding light on the concepts of crosstalk and interference. Subsequently, we survey quantum sources, detectors, channels and modulation techniques. More importantly, we discuss and analyze spatial multiplexing techniques, such as coherent control, multiplexing, diversity and MIMO. Finally, we identify synergies between the two communication technologies and grand open challenges that can be pivotal in the development of next-generation quantum communication systems."

    "abstract": "The substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) filters usually employ cross coupling to achieve quasi-elliptic responses, getting steep selectivity near the passband. However, the added cross coupling also facilitates the transmission of spurious modes, leading to significant spurious passbands and insufficient selectivity in the stopband. It has been challenging to address this problem effectively. In this letter, we propose a solution. By using the orthogonality of spurious modes and coupling paths, spurious modes can be naturally suppressed in both the main and cross-coupling paths, thereby suppressing spurious passbands and improving selectivity in the stopband. At the same time, the quasi-elliptic response remains unaffected, which can be designed as usual, and the structure change is very small without increasing the complexity compared with the conventional design. It should be effective for developing SIW filters in microwave and wireless circuits and systems."

    "abstract": "Prestack seismic inversion, as a quantitative interpretation method, can integrate multiple information under Bayesian theory framework to obtain the posterior probability density functions of elastic parameters for reservoir prediction. Particle filtering (PF) algorithm is a popular method for solving nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems, and can achieve promising results in prestack inversion. However, in traditional PF algorithms, even with the introduction of various resampling methods, the problem of particle impoverishment still exists, leading to inaccurate inversion results. To solve this problem, in this paper, the black-winged kite algorithm is used to replace the resampling process, and a black-winged kite particle filtering algorithm nonlinear prestack inversion method is proposed. This method overcomes the particle impoverishment problem and improves the inversion accuracy. We test the performance of our proposed method from both synthetic noisy data and a real dataset. Moreover, comparison with the whale optimization particle filter method shows that our proposed method can achieve higher inversion accuracy of elastic parameters."

Yet, while they have enabled breakthroughs in object re-identification and face verification, fundamental challenges remain: efficient negative sampling, robust training stability, and generalization across domains.In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of the evolution of metric and contrastive learning, from early Siamese and triplet architectures to recent developments in loss functions and sampling strategies. Building on these foundations, I will highlight the current research frontier, beyond pairwise comparisons toward self-supervised representation learning."

    "abstract": "This article presents a decentralized dynamic event-sampled control (ESC) strategy for multi-unit power systems (MUPSs) subject to mismatched interconnections. Initially, with the introduction of a dynamic event-sampling mechanism, the decentralized ESC problem of MUPSs is converted into a set of event-sampled optimal control problems of auxiliary subsystems. It is demonstrated that all the solutions of the event-sampled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations (ES-HJBEs) arising in these optimal control problems together constitute the decentralized dynamic ESC law. Then, in order to solve the ES-HJBEs, the critic neural networks (CNNs) within the adaptive dynamic programming framework are constructed. The CNNs’ weights are updated via simultaneously using the gradient descent method and concurrent learning. The benefits of such a tuning rule are that it not only makes full use of state data (including historical and instantaneous state data) but also no longer requires the persistence of excitation condition. Moreover, uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop auxiliary subsystem states and the CNNs’ weight estimation errors are proved via Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations of a three-unit power system are given to validate the present decentralized dynamic ESC scheme."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR). However, data-driven methods suffer from spurious correlations that conflate target attributes with confounding factors limiting generalization and robustness in complex conditions. The attribute scattering center (ASC) model, which can map SAR data to physically interpretable features, offers insights for addressing the aforementioned problem. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-granularity feature fusion network (MgFFNet) leveraging ASC to realize robust and interpretable target recognition in complex scenarios. First, we extract multi-granularity scattering features based on ASC model including scattering points feature and component feature. On this basis, we develop a multi-granularity deep feature embedding module that leverages scattering features to hierarchically guide vision features toward causally interpretable representations. Finally, we propose a multi-granularity feature fusion module to achieve different features aggregation, so as to facilitate target identity decision making. Evaluation experiments on two publicly released datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses numerous advanced SAR ATR methods."

    "abstract": "We study how to schedule data sources in a wireless time-sensitive information system with multiple heterogeneous and unreliable channels to minimize the total expected Age-of-Information (AoI). Although one could formulate this problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP), such an approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality and lack of insights. For single-channel systems, prior studies have developed lower-complexity solutions based on the Whittle index. However, Whittle index has not been studied for systems with multiple heterogeneous channels, mainly because indexability is not well defined when there are multiple dual cost values, one for each channel. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce new notions of partial indexability and partial index, which are defined with respect to one channel’s cost, given all other channels’ costs. We then combine the ideas of partial indices and max-weight matching to develop a Sum Weighted Index Matching (SWIM) policy, which iteratively updates the dual costs and partial indices. The proposed policy is shown to be asymptotically optimal in minimizing the total expected AoI, under a technical condition on a global attractor property. We also propose an interpolation-based algorithm to quickly compute (approximate) partial indices in real time. Extensive performance simulations demonstrate that the proposed policy offers significant gains over conventional approaches by achieving a near-optimal AoI. Further, the notion of partial index is of independent interest and could be useful for other problems with multiple heterogeneous resources."

    "abstract": "Complementary FET (CFET) technology is attracting widespread interest as one of the most promising scaling boosters. The additional interconnect layer required for the bottom device in CFET results in a more complex distribution of parasitic capacitance. In this article, we propose a strategy to extract the parasitic capacitance of CFET in standard cell (SDC). Considering the unique multilayer structure of CFET and the practical requirements for circuit design, the interconnections between gates can be categorized into five distinct configurations. Each configuration is further divided into three styles. The capacitance associated with the fixed-style part remains unchanged regardless of design variations and should be included in the compact model of the transistor. Each style is modeled using analytical approaches. For the first time, we evaluate the parasitic capacitance between the interconnections of PFET and NFET in CFET. The comparison between the model and numerical field solver simulation results, along with the transient simulation results obtained by applying the proposed strategy to circuits, comprehensively validates both the feasibility of the strategy and the accuracy of the model."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of 6G networks and AI-generated content (AIGC) is reshaping service provisioning at the wireless edge, where low-latency and computation-intensive tasks must be efficiently supported. Integrating AIGC with 6G Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems offers significant benefits, enabling real-time analytics, IoT data augmentation and synthesis, personalized services, and intelligent resource coordination across heterogeneous devices. However, provisioning AIGC services at the mobile edge poses formidable challenges: massive data heterogeneity, stringent delay requirements, and the inherent limitations of learning-based offloading methods, such as high training cost, unstable convergence, and weak transparency. Inspired by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we propose a hybrid optimization framework that combines classical wireless bandwidth pre-allocation for IoT devices connected to mobile edge computing (MEC) servers with Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)-based AIGC server selection. This hybrid classical-quantum design ensures stable results and enables efficient exploration of combinatorial allocation spaces. We further implement the quantum circuits and evaluate the performance of our proposed approach. Simulation results show that our method achieves lower processing latency and greater stability than conventional reinforcement learning and heuristic baselines in small- to medium-scale IoT deployments. While current quantum hardware scalability remains a constraint, the framework points toward a promising pathway for large-scale AIGC offloading as quantum technology matures."

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional mass production, customized discrete manufacturing—such as furniture panel production—generates massive, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic data throughout its lifecycle (order processing, process design, manufacturing execution). Storing this complex, interconnected lifecycle data in traditional relational databases suffers from high redundancy, weak relevance, dispersed distribution, and storage limitations. To address this, this paper proposes a generalizable knowledge graph-based method for knowledge modeling and fusion with semi-dynamic update capability in customized manufacturing, demonstrated through a case study in custom furniture panel production. Firstly, three ontology models (process, resource, feature) are constructed to structurally represent multi-source production knowledge, resolving issues of high redundancy and weak semantic associations found in traditional databases. Secondly, a bidirectional KG construction method is proposed, integrating top-down ontology modeling with bottom-up entity mining for effective dynamic knowledge integration. Thirdly, a graph embedding-based multi-dimensional knowledge fusion algorithm is designed, combined with order-based Knowledge Graph Fragment (KGF) models, to enable semantic association and reasoning of knowledge nodes across processes. A case study in a furniture factory validated the method, building a KG from the ontology models, confirming the fusion method's effectiveness in significantly improving production knowledge manageability and application efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome limitations (e.g., insufficient intent recognition, generalization) of pure knowledge graph-based QA systems, the constructed knowledge graph was integrated with the DeepSeek Large Language Model (LLM). This integration employs ontology-driven prompting and leverages the LoRA lightweight fine-tuning of the DeepSeek-LLM-7B-Chat. This KG–LLM fusion approach for customized manufacturing QA generates more domain-specific and professional responses than methods using solely LLM or KG. The proposed framework provides effective support for intelligent decision-making and optimization in mass-customization production environments, with validated efficacy in the furniture domain."

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is essential in city-level applications, where data-driven deep learning has become the most popular method. However, sufficient data in developing cities is not always accessible, posing a challenge for training effective models in scenarios with limited data. Recently, several works have promoted this issue through cross-city knowledge transfer and shown promising performances. However, existing methods can neither distinguish node divergence nor extract functional similarities between cities, which results in suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitations, we propose a Cross-city Correlation Learning (CCL) framework. Firstly, we construct a self-supervised learning model to infer accurate node-to-node and node-to-region cross-city correlations from multiple noisy labels without using any auxiliary information. Then, we achieve spatial knowledge transfer from a transfer-adaptive graph convolution network based on the learned correlations in two aspects: the learnable adjacency matrix and region-specific kernel parameters, which ensure the target models can transfer more and better utilize the knowledge from the source domain. The experiments are conducted on six real-world datasets and fully prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Distributed energy scheduling in residential microgrids faces challenges from renewable uncertainty and privacy constraints. While multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables decentralized coordination, classical MARL methods suffer from exponential growth in the joint state–action space, leading to high computational complexity and low sample efficiency. Moreover, centralized training paradigms often rely on shared representations, raising privacy concerns. In this article, we propose a multiagent distributional reinforcement learning framework with the dynamic hyper policy network (DHPN), which constructs permutation-invariant (PI) representations via entitywise dynamic weight generation and multihead attention, reducing input redundancy and obviating the need for full joint information. To capture stochasticity from renewable variability and demand, we further introduce a distributional value function factorization framework to model return distributions, leveraging quantile regression and mean–shape decomposition. Experiments on a data-driven microgrid demonstrate that the DHPN outperforms strong baselines by achieving substantially lower mean-square error in representational evaluation and higher cumulative rewards, while exhibiting faster convergence, enhanced training stability, and reduced grid fluctuations. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining PI representations with distributional value modeling for scalable privacy-aware multiagent energy management."

    "abstract": "Neutron radiography is a well-established non-destructive testing technique, but it remains insufficient to meet the demands of high-resolution imaging, particularly when based on a compact neutron source. Real-ESRGAN, a powerful image super-resolution method based on a generative adversarial network, is extended in this study to practical high-resolution restoration applications in neutron radiography. The complex degradation factors in neutron radiography (e.g., blur, noise, and gamma white spots) are considered to enhance the generalization ability of the super-resolution network for neutron image data. Thereafter, the U-Net discriminator is integrated with attention gates to enable the super-resolution network to focus on important features and suppress irrelevant information. To balance the cost and reliability of dataset construction, X-ray images are used as data drivers for model training. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method reconstructs high-resolution neutron radiographs with sharper texture details and less noise than state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques, in terms of both visual quality and quantity."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, offering unprecedented potential for optimizing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in telecommunications. This paper explores the application of quantum computing to telecom KPI optimization, contrasting its capabilities with those of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Telecom networks face increasing complexity due to rising data demands, 5 G deployment, and user expectations, necessitating advanced optimization techniques beyond traditional methods. While generative AI has shown promise in modeling network behaviour and predicting KPIs, it struggles with scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale, real-time systems. Quantum computing, leveraging principles like superposition and entanglement, excels in solving combinatorial optimization problems inherent in telecom networks, such as resource allocation and latency reduction. Through a detailed comparison, this paper highlights quantum computing’s superior speed, precision, and ability to handle multi-dimensional KPI datasets. A conceptual quantum framework for telecom optimization is proposed, supported by theoretical examples. The study concludes that while generative AI offers flexibility, quantum computing provides transformative advantages for future telecom systems, paving the way for nextgeneration network efficiency. Challenges such as hardware limitations and algorithm development are also discussed, alongside future research directions."

A total of 93 participants (58 RRMS patients with cognitive preservation (RRMS-CP) and with cognitive impairment (RRMS-CI), and 35 healthy controls with cognitive preservation (HC-CP) were evaluated using the Auditory Verbal Learning Test and stratified into three cognitive groups. U-fiber diffusivity metrics—including fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity—were extracted from 100 white matter regions. Feature selection via Sequential Forward Selection was combined with multiple classifiers, including Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our models achieved up to 100% accuracy (sensitivity: 98.64%, specificity: 98.17%) in distinguishing between HC-CP and RRMS-CP patients, 96.37% accuracy (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 97.50%) between HC-CP and RRMS-CI, 97.23% accuracy (sensitivity: 98.75%, specificity: 96.00%) between RRMS-CP and RRMS-CI, and 89.2% accuracy (sensitivity: 91.09%, specificity: 91.58%) across all three groups. We acknowledge limitations, including potential information leakage in feature selection, limited diffusion directions, and the need for advanced preprocessing pipelines.

The system replaces traditional ignition keys with proximity-based authentication, enabling ignition only when a registered BLE device (e.g., an iTag or smartwatch) is detected within a predefined signal strength threshold, verified through its MAC address and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). he hardware design incorporates an ESP32 board, a relay module, a buzzer, and status LEDs, all powered by the vehicle’s 12V supply and optimized for low-power operation. System software was developed using the Arduino IDE, and real- time BLE scanning was implemented with RSI-based filtering. Experiments conducted in controlled and real-world environments tested BLE detection range, response time, and system stability. Results demonstrated reliable performance up to 5 meters, with response times ranging from 1.8 to 2.8 seconds depending on the BLE device type and condition. The system successfully prevented engine activation when unauthorized devices were present or when the BLE signal dropped below the threshold. This research contributes a low-cost, energy-efficient, and scalable platform to the field of IoT-based vehicle security, with a clear pathway for future integration of GPS, mobile applications, and cloud-based monitoring for comprehensive protection."

    "abstract": "Urban zones are experiencing additional energy needs, with the conventional power sources failing to provide for the rapidly expanding populations at the expense of the environment. Street lights, traffic signals, and other public infrastructure require a continuous power supply, typically from the grid. However, the conservation systems are not sustainable and even contribute to the Carbon footprint. This paper gives a solution to this problem by introducing a Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Footpath (PEHF) system. The PEHF capitalises on pedestrian foot traffic to generate clean, renewable electricity via embedded piezoelectric transducers in the footpath tiles. The system harvests mechanical energy from footsteps and converts it to electrical power, which is stored and delivered to streetlights, environmental sensors, or other infrastructure. A real-time adaptive power optimisation algorithm (RAPOA) is proposed to control energy harvesting, enhance detection accuracy, and optimise energy storage. The system's architecture combines piezoelectric materials, energy management circuits, and the IoT for monitoring and data transmission, making it scalable for urban use. The PEHF had a power density of 1.2 W/m 2, 97-98% of the step detection and 15% step energy conversion efficiency, 25-35 times better than the existing systems in voltage output and 20 times in lifetime. The system achieves a step-detection accuracy of 97-98%, enabling reliable energy generation. The suggested solution is eco-friendly and cost-effective, serving as a sustainable power supply for urban infrastructure and promoting innovative city development. In summary, the PEHF system provides a scalable solution for efficiently using pedestrian energy, reducing reliance on conventional power sources and enhancing sustainability in urban settings."

Among the large-scale current systems in the magnetosphere, the ring current-a westwardflowing current-plays a central role in geomagnetic variations through its close relation to space weather. In this study, we apply the curlometer technique to perform a statistical analysis of ring current observations of Cluster in 2002. The current determinations are validated with the Dst index, which quantifies variations in Earth’s surface magnetic field.

The most common is a cascade control system with a proportional controller in the angle outer loop and with a proportional-integral-derivative controller in the angular velocity inner loop. The problem is that the dynamics of pitch and roll angular velocities can be described by a transfer function with differentiating element. Then, a controller with an integral component results in a closed-loop system with characteristic polynomial containing a zero root. A PID-controller design procedure based on the pole placement approach is proposed for this specific case."

Defect detection is vital for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of materials and structures across industries, as undetected flaws such as cracks or voids can compromise structural integrity and lead to catastrophic failures. Near-field imaging in the microwave region addresses these challenges by offering higher resolution, enhanced sensitivity, and the ability to detect both surface and subsurface defects with precision. SFTR further enhances near-field imaging by focusing energy at defect locations, suppressing noise, and improving signal-to-noise ratios. This synergy captures fine details, including evanescent waves, which are crucial for detecting subtle defects. The combination of highresolution imaging and advanced signal processing in near-field imaging based on SFTR presents a robust, reliable, and versatile solution for overcoming the limitations of traditional defect detection methods."

Traditional manual screening methods face numerous challenges, including accuracy, timeliness, and resource limitations. This study systematically compares the classification performance of four deep learning models-VGG-19, ResNet-50, SwinV2, and EfficientNetV2-on two publicly available optical coherence tomography (OCT) datasets (OCTDL and Retinal OCT-8). The models were comprehensively evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy and AUC. The results show that EfficientNetV2 outperforms the other models on both datasets, particularly under conditions with limited computational resources, demonstrating exceptional accuracy and efficiency. This study highlights the advantages of EfficientNetV2 in automated retinal disease diagnosis, making it an ideal choice for clinical applications, especially in resource-constrained environments. These findings strongly validate the potential of deep learning in medical imaging, providing robust support for the early diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases."

Several works have been proposed in the literature to address the issue of class imbalance. However, the task of imbalance learning in the audio domain still needs more attention. In this work, we provide a brief overview of current methods and discuss ways for addressing class imbalance in the audio domain especially. To further understand the impact of our suggested approach, we additionally conduct several tests on two purposefully imbalanced datasets (cats vs. dogs and major vs. minor chords) using three distinct audio representations. On both datasets, we find that the augmentation applied to spectrogram-based representations performs better than the other two approaches."

    "abstract": "The basis for managing student performance is the results of its monitoring. Performance monitoring includes, among other things, both current and periodic types of control. Current monitoring determines the quality of mastering the current study sections—current performance. Periodic monitoring is aimed at determining intermediate performance and is conducted over an entire course section at times scheduled by the teacher or educational institution, with the purpose of assessing the quality of material assimilation and, if necessary, adjusting the student's performance trajectory. The article proposes an algorithm to automate the management of current performance based on the analysis of the dynamics of a student’s grades accumulated up to the next periodic monitoring point. The goal of the algorithm is to provide the teacher with a timely signal that the student needs learning process correction. As a model for analyzing current performance, a model of discrete Markov chains with fuzzy states and the Kolmogorov–Chapman formula is proposed. The fuzzy states of student performance characterize the degree of mastery of different sections of the curriculum. Using discrete Markov chains with fuzzy states allows solving the following tasks: automatic classification of the degree of mastery of a course section at the current moment, considering the dynamics of the student's academic results; the classification is performed based on a relatively small amount of current performance grades."

This paper attempts to summarize the reasons for the inhomogeneity of mapping accuracy and guidelines for correcting errors that exceed tolerances. The research demonstrates a strong correlation between survey age and error correction frequency, with maps from the 19th and early 20th centuries showing significantly higher correction rates compared to modern surveys."

Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) is limited by slow convergence, low precision, and a high risk of local optima entrapment. These drawbacks are mitigated in MESMA through the integration of multiple strategies: the pinhole imaging inverse learning mechanism enhances search capability; individual mutation helps avoid premature convergence; and greedy selection ensures that superior solutions are retained. Extensive evaluations on the CEC2022 benchmark suite demonstrate that MESMA outperforms not only existing state-of-the-art algorithms but also enhanced variants of the SMA. Moreover, case studies on three engineering design problems confirm its feasibility and robustness in practical engineering applications."

    "abstract": "By advising and teaching farmers on how to apply modern farm practices that embrace Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), precision agriculture is revolutionising sustainable farming by optimising for usages that are as much as possible and waste as little as can be afforded. In this research, we propose an AIoT-driven Smart Agri Grid (ASAG) framework that integrates real-time nanosensor networks, an AI-operational control microclimate, an autonomous decision-support system, and secure data sharing via a blockchain using encrypted statistical data. To achieve real-time analytics, edge computing is used in the framework for real-time data analytics, predictive algorithms for dynamic irrigation & nutrient management, and federated learning for distributed AI training, which maintains privacy and scalability. In addition, the system uses AI-based waste-minimisation techniques, such as predictive harvest timing and the conversion of bio-waste into organic fertilisers, thereby reducing post-harvest losses. Experimental results show that ASAG can improve crop yield by 20 to 30%, reduce water waste by up to 50%, and reduce chemical overuse by up to 30%, with its economic and environmental benefits. The feasibility of such deployment on a large scale in precision agriculture is further confirmed by a cost-benefit analysis. The results reinforce the power of AI and IoT in transforming contemporary farming into a self-optimising, climate-resilient system. For long-term sustainability in global agriculture, quantum AI will be used to predict soil health, monitor AI-assisted carbon sequestration, and enable genomic AI for climate-resistant crops."

However, the dynamic nature of vehicular environments, particularly the Doppler Effect (DE), poses significant challenges to reliable communication in VANETs. This study proposes a Neural Network (NN)-based approach combined with a Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) optimization algorithm to predict the optimal Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) based on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and relative node mobility. Simulation results demonstrate the model’s robustness, achieving an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8%.

The survey was conducted along 19 transects in the Baranangsiang area utilizing the MALÅ Easy Locator Core system operating at 450 MHz. Radargram data were processed through noise filtering, amplitude normalization, and static correction to enhance clarity and interpretability. Hyperbolic reflections in the radargrams were used to identify discrete underground objects, while planar reflectors represented soil layers. The depth of identified utilities ranged from approximately 0.12 m to 3.00 m, depending on the type and installation standard. The results confirm that GPR is a reliable and non-destructive method for detecting underground utilities with varying material properties and depths.

The state space model of the nonlinear system is first established, and the UKF prediction step constructs input features for long short term memory network to adaptively estimate the noise covariance. Subsequently, the UKF performs real-time updates of system states and fault estimates. These updated values are utilized as loss functions to facilitate end-to-end training of the network. During the training process, a joint target loss function is proposed, and truncated backpropagation through time is adopted to enhance training efficiency. Finally, numerical simulation experiment is conducted which has proved that the estimation accuracy of the hybrid filter is higher than the standard UKF and the extended Kalman filter under unknown noise covariance."

    "abstract": "Branch Line Couplers (BLCs) are inevitable components in many microwave networks. As the evolving technologies demand the components to work in multiple frequencies, there is a need to explore and modify the conventional components to work for more than one frequency. In this work, the design and implementation of Branch Line coupler that supports the dual band operation is introduced. The proposed coupler differs from the conventional design with respect to length of the transmission line. This paper discusses two BLCs. The first coupler is constructed without a stub and it works for a particular frequency ratio of $\\mathbf{2}(\\mathbf{1. 1 5 ~ G H z} / \\mathbf{2 . 3 ~ G H z})$. In the second coupler design, stubs that are center-tapped in the horizontal (series) arms of the coupler are used $(0.92 \\mathrm{GHz} / 2.4 \\mathrm{GHz})$. These stubs help in widening the two frequencies of operation by increasing the frequency ratio to 2.6. The coupler designed with stubs can be used to operate at desired frequencies by parameterizing the stub length. The design, simulation and fabrication of the coupler is done and is verified through the scattering parameters and the phase response of the coupler."

This is partly due to the soft decoder involving the computation of non-linear functions with high computational complexity. Virtualized radio access networks (VRANs) are a new paradigm that brings software-based network functions to run on the cloud. In this paper, we propose four LDPC soft decoder approximations: a piecewise linear (PL) approximation, a polynomial approximation, a machine learning (ML) based approximation, and a modification of min-sum approximation using regression methods. We show that the approximations retain a comparable BLER performance and, at the same time, bring down the computational complexity of the decoder. We also show that the BLER performance of our approximations is significantly better than the well-known min-sum approximation. Our methods are suitable for direct implementation in cloud based VRAN systems."

    "abstract": "Volunteered geographic information (VGI) provides an efficient means of generating large-scale labels for building extraction from remote sensing imagery. However, the inherent noise in these labels often compromises the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Existing label correction methods heavily rely on unreliable early-stage predictions and are prone to error accumulation, which impedes their performance in building extraction tasks, particularly in complex scenes with localized noisy labels. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Multiview Collaborative Learning (MCL) framework that enables robust DCNN training for building extraction tasks under noisy supervision. MCL introduces multiview predicted probabilities produced by multiple late-stage networks, offering more reliable and diverse priors for correcting noisy labels. A Hidden Denoising Inference Model (HDIM) is further developed to infer latent clean labels by modeling the confidence of multiview predictions through an EM-based optimization process. Additionally, a Syloss function is designed to integrate inferred and observed labels, ensuring stable joint supervision throughout training. We evaluate the proposed MCL framework on two large-scale benchmarks—the newly collected Phoenix-building dataset (908.3<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) and the widely used WHU-Aerial dataset. Experiments show that MCL effectively alleviates the impact of noisy labels and consistently surpasses state-of-the-art noise-robust methods, demonstrating its strong reliability and scalability for large-scale building extraction. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/leo85-cc/MCL."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) is widely applied to solve combinatorial optimization, notably routing problems. While existing handcrafted-rule-based knowledge transfer operators facilitate inter-task information exchange and overall convergence in EMTO, they face key limitations: (1) reliance on excellent solutions as carriers hinders knowledge transfer between dimensionally heterogeneous tasks; (2) limited rule generalization impedes modeling complex mappings in many-task environments. To address these, this work proposes evolutionary knowledge transfer via graph learning (EKT-GL). Its core module is an online-updated neural network. EKT-GL introduces a model-based knowledge carrier to transfer common knowledge, replacing solution-based carriers. It employs end-to-end learning to seamlessly integrate similarity measurement, knowledge extraction, and transfer, overcoming manual rule limitations and ensuring superior generalization through data-driven training. In comparative experiments, two routing problems are used to construct many-task heterogeneous data sets with different scale (the maximum number of tasks is 100). Experimental results indicate that EKT-GL have competitive performance compared to other five state-of-the-art EMTO algorithms."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/tem.2025.3649069",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "To address the limitations of existing buffer monitoring methods, which overlook activity coupling characteristics and suffer from imbalanced monitoring granularity, this paper proposes a two-level buffer monitoring and control method for critical chain projects considering activity overlapping. The method first analyzes the overlapping execution pattern among coupled activities and their impact on project schedules and buffer consumption. It then determines activity rework time and buffer allocation amount based on the Poisson distribution of information exchange, project attribute factors, and an information evolution model. A phase-level buffer monitoring trigger is set to decide whether to refine monitoring granularity to the activity level, and buffer consumption at the activity level is dynamically triggered and monitored in a rolling manner. This forms a dynamic buffer monitoring system that coordinates phase-level and activity-level control. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms classic approaches across project sizes, reducing project duration by up to 33.28%, project cost by up to 22.71%, and schedule overrun proportion by up to 34.94% under increasing uncertainty. While higher uncertainty slightly decreases the monitoring efficiency of the proposed method, it consistently remains above 0.70, higher than that of the established approaches. By considering overlapping task execution and employing a two-level trigger with rolling updates, the method effectively avoids lagging or excessive buffer warnings, achieving more efficient buffer management."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models enable high-quality image generation conditioned on textual prompts. However, fine-tuning these pre-trained models for personalization raises concerns about unauthorized dataset usage. To address this issue, dataset ownership verification (DOV) has recently been proposed, which embeds watermarks into fine-tuning datasets via backdoor techniques. These watermarks remain dormant on benign samples but produce owner-specified outputs when triggered. Despite its promise, the robustness of DOV against copyright evasion attacks (CEA) remains unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how adversaries can circumvent these mechanisms, enabling models trained on watermarked datasets to bypass ownership verification. We begin by analyzing the limitations of potential attacks achieved by backdoor removal, including TPD and T2IShield. In practice, TPD suffers from inconsistent effectiveness due to randomness, while T2IShield fails when watermarks are embedded as local image patches. To this end, we introduce CEAT2I, the first CEA specifically targeting DOV in T2I diffusion models. CEAT2I consists of three stages: (1) motivated by the observation that T2I models converge faster on watermarked samples with respect to intermediate features rather than training loss, we reliably detect watermarked samples; (2) we iteratively ablate tokens from the prompts of detected samples and monitor feature shifts to identify trigger tokens; and (3) we apply a closed-form concept erasure method to remove the injected watermarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEAT2I effectively evades state-of-the-art DOV mechanisms while preserving model performance. The code is available at https://github.com/csyufei/CEAT2I."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming (GFM) converters are required to meet multiple operational and control demands in power systems. Under grid fault conditions, maintaining transient synchronization stability (TSS), suppressing fault overcurrent, maximizing fault current support, and preserving voltage source characteristics are all of critical importance. However, achieving effective coordination among these objectives remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a systematic fault ride-through control strategy capable of rapid current limiting while ensuring the existence of a stable equilibrium point (SEP). Specifically, a novel concept of the GFM operational region is introduced, where the existence of the SEP is rigorously determined via a geometric interpretation, providing a solid stability foundation for the control design. Subsequently, a two-stage virtual admittance (VA) control strategy with accurate current-limiting capability is developed. This strategy employs a predominantly inductive steady-state VA for precise fault current regulation, while incorporating a transient virtual resistance to increase the resistive component of the transient VA, thereby dynamically suppressing current surges. Compared to conventional fixed virtual impedance methods, this approach achieves a balance between steady-state accuracy and transient suppression performance. Furthermore, a coordinated active and reactive power reference strategy is proposed to enhance TSS and ensure maximum fault current injection. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed control strategy exhibits superior comprehensive performance in maintaining system stability, achieving fast current limiting, and providing enhanced fault current support, validating its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Frequency Agile (FA) radar achieves superior antijamming capabilities by modulating the carrier frequency across different pulses. However, the array manifold changes with the carrier frequencies of different pulses, making it challenging to utilize multi-frequency information for Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation effectively. This paper presents a DOA estimation method for FA radar in both random frequency mode and adaptive mode. Initially, in random frequency mode, the algorithm runs at the receiver while the transmitter’s carrier frequency varies randomly. A dictionary matrix that integrates multi-carrier frequency information is developed to estimate the DOA of multiple targets using Sparse Recovery (SR) theory. Subsequently, the theoretical performance bounds for DOA estimation in the random frequency mode are analytically derived. Utilizing the pre-estimated DOA results obtained from the random frequency mode, the adaptive mode jointly optimizes both carrier frequency and dictionary matrix to lower theoretical performance bounds, thereby improving the accuracy and resolution of multi-target DOA estimation. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showing significant improvements in DOA estimation performance compared to traditional methods."

    "abstract": "This paper presents and experimentally validates a unified primary model-based predictive control (MPC) strategy for distributed energy resources (DERs). The proposed primary control simultaneously regulates voltage, frequency, and internal filter voltages and currents, eliminating the need for traditional internal control loops. Additionally, the method can set a predefined operating point while imposing constraints on the inverter’s output current. To achieve these objectives, the MPC incorporates the dynamics of the LCL filter, improving the system’s prediction accuracy. The MPC problem is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) task solved using the OSQP solver for computational efficiency. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed primary control approach, demonstrating its practical feasibility and robust performance."

In such networks, accurate detection of the source modulation scheme is critical for reliable data detection at the destination. The proposed method jointly exploits the temporal delay diversity inherent in DF-FD architectures and feedback from the data decoding process to refine recognition decisions while maintaining manageable complexity. An iterative expectation–maximization procedure is designed for the maximum-likelihood estimate of the modulation format, with the additional capability of estimating timing information and frequency-selective channel parameters. Simulated evaluations under various OFDM scenarios verify the steady superiority of the proposed solution over conventional techniques."

This study proposes an AI-based method for estimating gait speed in the real-world context in COPD patients using different combinations of three wearable devices: a smartphone, a smartwatch, and a pair of sensorized shoes. An analysis pipeline is developed and trained using laboratory datasets, then validated on an independent dataset acquired under free-walking conditions, demonstrating strong performance in both walking detection and gait speed estimation with mean accuracies across different device combinations of 0.81, 0.93, and 0.90 for resting, walking, and stair climbing activities, respectively, as well as a mean RMSE of 0.118 m/s and an ICC of 0.80. The estimated speed, obtained by applying the developed pipeline to daily life data of COPD patients, showed a strong and significant correlation with the clinical standard of functional capacity, the six-minutes walking distance (6MWD) across 34 patients (Spearman coefficient = 0.854, p-value = 1.38e-10). These findings highlight the feasibility of unobtrusive, continuous gait speed monitoring in real-life conditions, offering a promising integrative tool to traditional clinical assessments. The results suggest that wearable-based mobility monitoring could enhance remote patient management and personalized care strategies for COPD and other chronic conditions."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Function name inference in stripped binaries is a crucial task that supports various security applications, including vulnerability detection and malware analysis. Existing methods suffer from limited model capacity and insufficient exploitation of function semantics, which constrains their ability to comprehend binary code and leads to poor generalization on unseen binaries. To address these problems, we propose BinLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to exploit the semantic potential of binary code, thereby enhancing function name inference. Specially, BinLLM integrates three key innovations: (1) source code semantics-guided function name refinement, which mitigates the negative effects of low-quality semantic identifiers during training; (2) A context-aware data collection algorithm that seeks richer semantic dependencies to improve model training and inference performance; (3) parameter-efficient fine-tuning on a domain-specific dataset enriched with semantic knowledge to enhance the model's understanding of binary semantics. These components collectively enhance the model's performance in function name inference on unseen binaries. We evaluate BinLLM on a large-scale dataset comprising <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2,864,719$</tex> functions across four architectures (x86-64, x86-32, ARM, MIPS) and four optimization levels (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{O} 0-\\mathrm{O} 3$</tex>). Experimental results show that BinLLM achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with relative gains of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$320.1 \\%, 274.8 \\%$</tex>, and 297.6 % in precision, recall, and F1-score. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in enhancing overall performance."

To ensure a fair comparison, we control for both the number of parameters and the size of the training samples. Specifically, we focus on the functions with jump discontinuities or with coherent oscillations, and analyze the results through the perspective of spectral bias. Our experimental results suggest that the performance of KANs depends heavily on whether the high-frequency components originate from the underlying signal. Furthermore, even when KANs outperform MLPs in quantitative metrics, their behavior can still exhibit undesirable artifacts. For instance, when dealing with functions with jump discontinuities, KANs show Gibbs-like oscillations near the discontinuity. We hope these experiments offer valuable insights for future neural network research and encourage further investigation into overcoming these challenges."

    "abstract": "Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machines (FSPM) and Wound-Field Flux Switching Machines (WF-FSM) hold a critical role in modern electric machine technology. FSPM motors are widely employed in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and highperformance industrial systems due to their high-power density, compact design, and superior efficiency. In contrast, WoundField Flux Switching Machines, with their wound-field rotor structure, provide more precise and flexible torque control, offering low torque ripple, high average torque, and reduced harmonic content, which make them particularly advantageous for applications requiring accurate and stable operation. In this study, the Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machine was first designed, and using the same design parameters, a WoundField Flux Switching Machine motor was subsequently developed. A parametric analysis was performed in Ansys Maxwell to identify the optimal Direct Current (DC) supply current for the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine, which was determined to be 17 A. Based on this current, torque and back electromotive force (back EMF) waveforms as well as magnetic flux distribution visualizations were obtained for the WoundField Flux Switching Machine. These results were then employed to perform a comparative evaluation of the performance characteristics of both motors. The analysis revealed that the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine exhibited a more stable operational profile with low torque ripple and high average torque, whereas the FSPM motor showed more pronounced torque fluctuations and higher harmonic content in its back EMF. Additionally, the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine demonstrated superior performance in terms of vibration and mechanical stress. The findings of this study indicate that the Wound-Field Flux Switching Machine is a more suitable choice for applications requiring precise and stable motor control, providing valuable insights for motor design optimization and system integration decisions."

However, existing research lacks a structured understanding of how AI systems support analyst CSA across different decision-making modes. This paper presents a systematisation of knowledge (SoK) that examines how AI-enabled tools contribute to the three levels of CSA: perception, comprehension and projection, across three decision-making modes: automated, augmented, and collaborative. We introduce a three-dimensional framework to assess 73 selected studies, mapping AI support across CSA levels and decision-making modes, specifically for SOC Tier 1 and Tier 2 incident detection and response activities. Our analysis reveals a dominant focus on perception-level support in automated settings, limited attention to higher-level CSA in augmented mode, and no work addressing collaborative decision-making. These findings highlight critical gaps and inform future research directions for designing AI systems that more comprehensively enhance analyst CSA in SOCs."

This research proposes a new framework, NFTraX-ART, that leverages dynamic Non-Fungible Tokens (dNFTs), IoT smart tags, and blockchain to enable live tracking, smooth ownership transfers, and a clear asset history for art. Unlike static NFTs, dNFTs keep changing as metadata that shows where they are now, who owns them, their exhibition history, and their official appraisal information is updated. As for physical artworks, Internet of Things technology with location and movement sensors continuously sends this data to the blockchain to confirm their authenticity and provide clear traceability. Using smart contracts, royalties are automatically applied, all transactions are validated, and alerts are sent when any movements are made outside the programmed areas. Thanks to this mode, the system connects digital and physical worlds, making it safe and straightforward to track essential art pieces. It outlines the important steps for the methodology, the smart contract code, and the simulation process, and checks how the model stacks up against today’s static NFT platforms. According to the results, blockchain systems are more accurate, safer, and track transaction history. Thanks to NFTraX-ART, everyone involved has a secure, up-to-date record of every artwork. Using this approach, NFTs take on an active role in the tracking system, helping change how art is possessed, transferred, and appreciated in the art trading world."

While traditional rigid-link parallel manipulators offer advantages in stiffness and precision, they are often limited by inherent issues such as friction, backlash, and wear associated with conventional kinematic joints. This proposed structure addresses these limitations by leveraging the inherent flexibility and controlled deformation of compliant elements, typically realized through flexure hinges, to achieve three degrees of freedom (e.g., one translational and two rotational motions) without the need for discrete joints. The compliant nature of the tripod facilitates monolithic structure, leading to enhanced repeatability and reduced assembly complexity."

They are especially valuable for validating simulators and calibrating models. Among these metrics, power consumption is critical—particularly for low-power designs—but measuring it accurately outside of simulation environments presents challenges in terms of cost and complexity.To address this, FPGA boards often rely on built-in sensors and monitoring systems. However, such tools are not universally available across all platforms. In this paper, We revisit power measurement using a simple shunt resistor method and demonstrate its effectiveness across FPGA platforms. Using this setup, we analyze how different workloads and memory hierarchies influence both memory and system power. Our study highlights trade-offs often missed in DRAM power models, such as the cache power overhead that can outweigh memory savings, and the shifting efficiency of on-chip memory under contention. Together, these results provide practical guidance for power-aware FPGA evaluation and model calibration."

    "abstract": "Ring topology is a topology design widely used in networks, especially backbone networks. In designing a ring topology, the problem that is solved is how to connect each node to form a ring with the optimum total cost. The optimum weight is the path with the best bandwidth and delay in the topology. To solve these problems can be modeled like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The main goal to be achieved by the TSP algorithm is to find the optimum path with a fast search time. This paper proposes a new heuristic algorithm approach to find the optimum route. The proposed algorithm will be compared with existing TSP algorithms like ant colony optimization (ACO) to validate the results of the proposed algorithm. The brute force algorithm can find the optimum path though it takes a very long time as the number of nodes increases. The ACO algorithm can find the most optimum route faster than the brute force algorithm. Based on the tests, the proposed algorithm can find the most optimal path with a faster time than the ACO algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithm can find the optimal route that is better than the ACO algorithm."

    "abstract": "In the coal process, coal-gangue classification is a critical link that directly determines the subsequent processing quality and production efficiency. Statistics show that over $80 \\%$ of global small and medium-sized coal mines still rely on manual visual inspection for this task. However, the high similarity in color, texture, and morphology between coal and gangue results in an average manual misjudgment rate of $15 \\%-20 \\%$, severely hindering the intelligent transformation of the coal mining industry. Thus, developing accurate, real-time automatic classification technology is practically significant for mining intelligent upgrading. Manual classification is susceptible to operators’ subjective experience and on-site lighting variations. Existing YOLO-series models lack adequate ability to capture subtle feature differences between coal and gangue, making it hard to balance real-time performance and accuracy in complex mine environments. In response to these challenges, this work introduces a multi-scale gated attention (MSGA) module into YOLOv8, forming the YOLOv8-MSGA framework, while further employing varied data augmentation strategies and refining the neck fusion mechanism. Using on-site samples, a 4,000-image dataset was formed after augmentation. Tests show the model achieves 96.10% MAP@0.5 and 38.52 FPS, meeting real-time sorting requirements and supporting intelligent mining."

To this end, this paper proposes a traffic light recognition method based on lightweight MobileViT network. First, MobileViT, which combines the advantages of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) local feature extraction and Transformer global modeling, is used as the backbone network. Subsequently, the network architecture and training strategy are specifically tailored to address the challenges associated with small traffic light targets. Finally, deep compression techniques are applied to ensure compatibility with the computational constraints of vehicle platforms. Experiments show that the recognition accuracy of MobileViT is 92% under normal lighting conditions, 85% under low lighting conditions, and 80% for small target recognition. The real-time reasoning experimental results show that MobileViT achieves an inference speed of 35 FPS with an input of 224x224 pixels, and the amount of calculation (Floating Point Operations, FLOPs) is 0.3B. Compared with other models, MobileViT finds a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, showing stronger robustness and efficiency, and is suitable for actual vehicle environments."

    "abstract": "In the era of Industry 4.0 (4IR), the Internet of Things (IoT) drives the transformation of conventional operation mode into intelligent systems through interconnecting smart devices to monitor, analyze, and optimize the target applications. In order to achieve energy-saving data transmission, a routing protocol, called RPL, has been specified for resource-challenged IoT devices and networks. In the context of 4IR, the IoT technology is being widely used for mission-critical systems, and the data collected by IoT devices might contain privacy-sensitive information. In addition, the IoT gateway could be compromised due to the lack of necessary and persistent physical and/or logical security protection. Hence, the protection of data security and privacy becomes a crucial factor for RPL-based IoT systems to realize their quality of service requirements and objectives successfully. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation approach, called SPARDA, for IoT devices and networks running the RPL routing protocol. SPARDA is realized with physical unclonable function, homomorphic encryption, and trapdoor function, and is perfectly integrated with the RPL routing protocol to prevent the malicious IoT gateway from either accessing, falsificating, or corrupting the real-time data from IoT devices throughout the data gathering and summarization phase. We choose an automatic security protocol verification tool, widely known as AVISPA, to analyze and verify the security specification of SPARDA. We also conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance of SPARDA by comparing with benchmark methods. The experimental results indicate that not only does SPARDA protect IoT networks from malicious gateway attacks, but it also outperforms existing schemes in terms of computation and storage overheads while satisfying all critical security and privacy criteria."

    "abstract": "Multi-modality SS-OCTA (Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography), which combines structural B-scan and vascular Angio-flow data, has been shown to be an effective modality to predict Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) diseases outcomes. However, there is a paucity of research in leveraging complementary information via multimodality fusion of SS-OCTA, where conventional fusion strategies are limited in their ability to extract RVO prognosisrelated features. We identified three key challenges with existing methods: (1) the dominance of information-rich modalities (e.g., B-scan) over other modalities (e.g., Angio-flow); (2) static weighting in multi-modality fusion which causes sub-optimal of fusion at inference stage; and (3) the failure of 2D models to capture 3D spatial contextual information from volumetric imaging data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D multi-modality Dynamic Fusion ConvNeXt (mmDFC) framework. Our mmDFC introduces three contributions: (1) a decoupled training approach with ConvNeXt encoders to mitigate modality dominance by preserving specified gradient information for each input source; (2) an uncertainty-aware dynamic fusion mechanism to optimally balance the weights of different modalities; (3) a 3D ConvNeXt architecture to effectively learn the spatial context from SS-OCTA slices. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$75 \\%$</tex> and an AUC of 71.3% for NPA prediction on clinical 3D SS-OCTA RVO dataset. Notably, our 3D approach yielded a 6.2% AUC improvement over an analogous 2D framework, demonstrating the value of volumetric spatial context. Our 3D mmDFC sets a new benchmark for SS-OCTA image analysis, providing a robust approach to prognostic assessment in RVO."

OMPS onboard SNPP/NOAA-20/NOAA-21 satellites are polar orbiting instruments, providing global coverage once a day. However, GEMS, onboard South Korea's GEO-KOMPSAT-2B satellite, is a geostationary satellite instrument providing more frequent observations over East Asia and adjacent areas. This difference in their orbits defines their unique capabilities and limitations, making intercomparison an essential exercise for harmonizing their datasets and validating their respective ozone retrievals. OMPS provides global coverage, delivering ozone profiles and trace gases with a lower temporal resolution but comprehensive spatial coverage. GEMS complements this by offering high temporal resolution data, allowing the monitoring of diurnal variations in ozone. The intercomparison between OMPS and GEMS helps to evaluate radiometric calibration consistency of measurements. This study focuses on quantifying the radiometric consistency between NOAA-21 OMPS Nadir Mapper (NM) radiance and reflectance measurements with GEMS. One of the benefits of GEO-LEO intercomparison is the satellites have nearly frequent simultaneous overlapping observations. The sensor intercomparison is performed near nadir for OMPS and GEMS, less than 8° view zenith angle. The radiometric bias results provide a good understanding of how well NOAA-21 OMPS agree with GEMS. The results could help to provide independent validation of OMPS data quality. The study could be further expanded to perform intercomparison of GEMS with SNPP and NOAA-20, resulting in opportunities to evaluate the OMPS radiometric consistency through double difference. This could help to further confirm the SNPP, NOAA-20 and, NOAA-21 OMPS radiometric agreements from the past studies performed using 32-day global average and using deep convective clouds. The results presented in this study are valuable for user communities to better understand how well the OMPS and GEMS agree with each other."

To address these limitations, this study proposes an improved multi-view Transformer framework for classroom dynamics perception and precise teaching intervention. The framework integrates cross-view geo-alignment with attention fusion to ensure semantic consistency across multiple camera views, introduces role-aware hierarchical queries to highlight teacher-student interactions, and employs decision-guided multitask learning to align recognition outcomes with practical intervention needs. Experiments conducted on real multi-view classroom videos demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in behavior classification, temporal modeling, and intervention ranking compared with existing baselines. This work not only contributes to advancing intelligent education analytics but also provides methodological support for achieving SDGs in promoting equitable, inclusive, and highquality education."

    "abstract": "Gain control in modern Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA) designs is typically achieved through load resistor-based or current Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)-based techniques, each offering distinct advantages and trade-offs. While resistor-based methods provide simplicity, they often degrade bandwidth. Current DAC-based approaches offer finer control and faster switching but suffer from linearity issues at low current levels and require significant silicon area. These limitations pose challenges in advanced Serializer/Deserializer (SERDES) systems where area efficiency and high-speed performance are critical.To address these constraints, a new gain control technique is proposed that utilizes a controllable resistor circuit placed between the differential output nodes of the VGA. This output-stage configuration minimizes interference with the signal path and biasing circuitry, enabling effective gain reduction without compromising linearity. The design employs NMOS transistors as programmable resistive elements, controlled via a 3-bit thermometric scheme, offering discrete gain steps with minimal area and power overhead. Although the method supports only unidirectional gain control, it remains highly suitable for high-speed SERDES applications. Initial gain can be set using conventional techniques, with this approach providing fine-tuning capabilities. Despite a slight increase in output capacitance, the overall impact on performance is negligible, making this solution a compact, power-efficient alternative for advanced Analog Front-End AFE designs."

Current robots that do these jobs require humans to wear a glove with numerous piezoelectric sensors within them. Failure of these sensors could lead to the robot arm not following the instruction correctly. In this research a robot is designed and built to the gestures of a human hand moving in front of a laptop camera. The motors that are actuated are placed away from the arm that does the work and elastic strings are used to transmit the actuation of the servo motors to move the fingers of the robot arm. This way the motors will not get contaminated by the hazardous material and can be more easily maintained. Two software were used, one to capture the hand movement and convert it to binary data and the second to operate the motors."

The most effective configuration was a multimodal fusion model that leveraged a language-specific IndicBERT for language-specific textual features and a CNN for visual analysis, achieving an F1-score of 0.81 and an accuracy of 71%. We incorporate a knowledge graph that maps hateful keywords to underlying semantic topics, providing essential interpretability. This work establishes a robust, effective and interpretable baseline for hate speech detection within the underrepresented domain of Indic language meme analysis."

    "abstract": "Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration (MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided, modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively. The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings, and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

Rather than evaluating performance metrics, the framework assesses modularity, interoperability, and governance reproducibility across technical, institutional, regulatory, social, and digital dimensions. Three candidate projects—Cirata (Indonesia), Hapcheon (South Korea), and O'MEGA1 (France)—were selected using documented criteria for structural alignment across all five pillars. Cirata serves as the reference architecture; Hapcheon reflects government-led inland deployment, while O'MEGA1 illustrates private-sector innovation in marine conditions. Selection criteria and comparative attributes were systematically documented, forming the analytical base for cross-case synthesis. Findings show notable differences in interoperability and governance resilience, influenced by institutional coordination and regulatory embedding. The proposed framework offers a replicable model for evaluating floating PV systems, emphasizing reproducibility in multi-actor energy governance."

This paper shows how this approach is used for solution of linear equation systems and mathematical models parameters identification, both linear in parameters, using pseudo-inversion of matrices, and nonlinear ones. A connection with the methods of ridge and LASSO regression is noted. The paper considers the ways to generalize regularization by using different norms, weight matrices and combination of norms. A generalization of the regularization approach to solve mathematical remodeling problems is proposed, an approach that is constructed to transform models of one class into another for some benefit. The approach leads to decrease complexity of models, but lose some accuracy."

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for explainable and interpretable model predictions in high-stake decision-making machine learning applications to ensure transparency, trust, and accountability. The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers explainability by linking predictions to input features. However, the current TM lacks a systematic feature ranking mechanism. Feature ranking can inherently lead to the pruning of less important features, making TM more efficient in terms of memory and inference. This paper proposes a feature ranking algorithm that leverages all trained clauses. The algorithm computes the frequency of true and false literals across all clauses to assign importance scores to the features. Once the feature ranking is finalized, the less important features are discarded, and a pruned TM is initialized, trained, and used for the prediction. The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of the SHAPbased feature ranking method. The algorithm was evaluated on multiple datasets and cross-validated with tree-based SHAP ranking. The results show that the proposed clause-driven feature importance method yields feature rankings comparable to SHAP while maintaining competitive accuracy with respect to other machine learning models."

This study utilizes OpenSim to analyze joint kinematics in healthy and poststroke participants, validating simulation-generated gait data against an experimental motion capture dataset for accuracy and reliability. This study focused on elderly individuals aged 70-75 years from an existing dataset. To examine gait deviations due to stroke-related impairments, Group A included 9 healthy subjects, while Group B comprised 11 post-stroke individuals. Results indicate that OpenSim underestimates knee and ankle flexion, leading to discrepancies in range of motion (ROM) and root mean square deviation (RMSD). A two-sample Student’s t-test confirms significant hip joint deviations in post-stroke gait while Spearman’s correlation coefficient test shows a high correspondence in trend between OpenSim and experimental results, particularly the hip joint. These findings support the refinement of biomechanical simulations for stroke rehabilitation and clinical gait analysis."

Our framework first decouples the distillation and classification tasks via lightweight projectors to shield the student's backbone. It then uses a cross-level attention mechanism to embed the teacher's high-level semantics into student features. Finally, a novel Frequency-domain Knowledge Revealing (FKR) module with a learnable filter extracts these embedded, high-frequency details characteristic of the teacher's knowledge. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset demonstrate that StegaKD consistently outperforms various baseline, validating the efficacy of our information hiding approach."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), their advantages in context analysis and semantic inferencing are becoming increasingly prominent, and we are attempting to introduce them into the realm of DNS repair. As is well known, DNS, as the core of Internet infrastructure, has complex policies and a fragile system, where even a small misconfiguration can lead to catastrophic service failures. Especially in large-scale networks, analyzing detected errors and generating repair solutions often requires operators to invest a significant amount of time and effort. This paper proposes a scalable framework, DNSHolmes, designed to leverage LLMs for generating DNS configuration repair solutions. Specifically, this method first addresses the numerous potential root causes in large-scale errors by abstracting them into a small number of State Equivalence Classes (SECs). It then adopts a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to compute a Critical Path Graph (CPG) for each class, precisely isolating the minimal set of records responsible for the failure. Crucially, the CPG serves as a focused, verifiable context for a Large Language Model (LLM), guiding it to generate accurate patches while overcoming the fundamental context-length limitations that help LLM with effective repair reasoning. Our evaluation on large-scale public datasets and a real-world campus network demonstrates that DNSHolmes can reduce operational effort by 78.4% and achieve efficient repair in large-scale DNS configuration."

    "abstract": "Efficient multiplier design is critical for DSP, cryptography, and high-performance computing. The Karatsuba multiplication algorithm reduces computation but is significantly reliant on the adder used for partial product accumulation. The Brent-Kung adder, which has an area of $408 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} 2$, a power consumption of $45.78 \\mu \\mathrm{~W}$, and a timing slack of 1 ns, is the most efficient option for this design, based on a comparative analysis of adders, including the Brent-Kung, Carry Select, and Ripple Carry Adders. This paper introduces a 32-bit Karatsuba multiplier based on a Brent-Kung (BK) adder that is optimised for power, area, and performance. In addition, scan flip-flops are used to improve testing and reliability throughout manufacturing testing. The Karatsuba algorithm is designed and implemented with the Brent-Kung adder’s parallel prefix structure, which reduces carry propagation time and increases total computational performance. Cadence EDA tools were used to implement the RTL to GDSII pipeline. The Brent-Kung adderbased design resulted in a 27.8% reduction in area compared to the conventional design employing square root carry select adder. The existing design has a slack of 0.068 ns, indicating improved timing closure. Post-layout simulations show that the BrentKung adder-based Karatsuba multiplier outperforms traditional architectures, making it an excellent choice for high-performance, energy-efficient computing applications."

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in qualitative settings, their use as autonomous moderators has been proposed, though little is known about their performance in emotionally charged contexts. This study aimed to evaluate ModiBot, a customizable LLM-based focus group moderator, under simulated challenging scenarios. Using a Discord-based platform, four focus groups were conducted with role-playing researchers to simulate dynamics such as constructive discussion, anger, peer conflict, and moderator-directed protest. ModiBot guided participants through structured phases including onboarding, discussion, AI-mediated synthesis, and reflective validation. Quantitative evaluations and qualitative sentiment and thematic analyses revealed that ModiBot was perceived as objective and able to ensure anonymity and structure, but struggled to de-escalate emotional conflict, adapt to complex group behaviors, and manage conversation pacing. The emotional flatness and rigid message flow led to reduced empathy and cohesion. While the tool successfully facilitated data collection, its social intelligence was limited in group contexts. Further interdisciplinary development is needed to enhance emotional responsiveness and adaptability in LLM moderators for sensitive or volatile research environments."

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset—a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model’s generalization in the tree-ring detection task."

    "abstract": "Falcon is a lattice-based post-quantum digital-signature scheme standardized by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As for its hardware implementation, signature verification is the critical operation, in which the polynomial multiplier and the hash generator are computationally intensive. Existing hardware implementations face an inherent resource–performance tradeoff in the multiplier, and the overall verification latency remains high. In this article, we present an accelerator for Falcon signature verification using area-efficient number-theoretic transform (NTT) architecture with simplified Barrett modular multiplier. The precomputed constant of Barrett modular-multiplication unit is adjusted from 21 845 to 21 840. This modification maintains computation correctness while lowering resource consumption and improving throughput, which serves as an efficient building block for NTT/inverse NTT (INTT) operations. Moreover, a fully pipelined, nonstored radix-2 multipath delay commutator (R2-MDC) architecture is adopted for the NTT/INTT, which effectively reduces the delay and achieves a more balanced resource–performance tradeoff. Both the polynomial multiplier and the hash generator are parallelized to improve performance. A complete Falcon-1024 signature verification accelerator is implemented on FPGA platform. Experimental results show that, for the two-stage NTT inside the multiplier, the proposed design attains the lowest area–time product (ATP) compared to state-of-the-art designs, and the ATP of the entire Falcon-1024 verification procedure is reduced by 50%."

Existing methods mainly focus on reconstructing from available modalities, while ignoring the specific information of missing modalities and the inconsistent distribution between original and recovered data. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype-based modality-specific feature Distillation Network called ProDNet, which can recover the specific information of missing modalities with more consistent distributions between original and recovered data. In particular, we design a category-specific prototype for each modality to store the modality-specific information, and reconstruct the missing modality by combining the invariant features from existing modalities with the prototype of the missing modality in a feature self-distillation manner. To obtain favorable invariant features, we design an invariant feature distillation strategy, in which the weight-gating mechanism is introduced to enhance invariant feature representation. Finally, to reduce distributional inconsistency, we design a distribution consistency distillation loss to enforce the consistent distribution of original and recovered data by considering the sample correlation between teacher and student networks. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, particularly in scenarios with higher missing rates."

    "abstract": "With external ionospheric corrections, precise point positioning solutions can be augmented with proper constraints, enabling fast convergence and high-precision positioning performance. However, there are two main issues in user algorithms. Firstly, the contribution of the number of applied ionospheric corrections on positioning performance is not clear to users. For instance, in low-cost sensors where computation resources are limited, applying too many corrections (e.g., tens of corrections) from server will possibly cause slow response. Secondly, the determination of constraining strength for corrections from different satellites remains challenging. Therefore, this paper evaluates the effect of the number of ionospheric corrections on positioning errors and convergence time, and proposes an improved tight-constraining algorithm for partial reliable corrections. Static and simulated kinematic positioning results confirm that the more corrections applied, the better the positioning performance. However, the positioning accuracy only has limited improvements when several corrections are already applied, especially in the north direction. The proposed method reduces static positioning root-mean-square errors by 43.4%, 26.9%, and 32.1% in the east, north, and up directions, respectively, compared to solutions without constraint. In simulated kinematic results, the convergence time is further shortened by 7.7%, 4.8%, and 2.5% for the east, north, and up directions, respectively, compared to cases where all corrections are applied."

    "abstract": "Owning to its high efficiency characteristic, resonant converter is designed to operate at resonant frequency as a DC transformer (DCX), where the transformer turns ratio is designed based on the nominal input and output bus voltages. However, the limited number of printed circuit board(PCB) layers and turns makes it difficult for planar transformer to achieve non-integer turns ratio. The common solutions include fractional-turn transformer and matrix transformer, but neither method can achieve non-integer turns ratio without increasing the number of turns. This paper proposes a reluctance-controlled arbitrary non-integer turns ratio planar transformer structure. The proposed structure splits the center column of the magnetic core, and primary windings are wound on two columns and connected in series. By adjusting the reluctance ratio of the two columns, the proposed method achieves arbitrary non-integer turns ratio with fewer turns. Finally, a 30 V-12 V 120 W LLC DCX converter is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional solution, winding loss was reduced by 1.164 W under full-load condition, and the peak efficiency and full-load efficiency were increased by 0.43% and 1.08%, respectively."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies."

    "abstract": "Despite notable advancements in applying epidemic models to cybersecurity, current approaches often underperform in practice. Research indicates that these models can produce substantial prediction errors due to challenges in parameter estimation, the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world networks, and limitations in accurately evaluating model performance against empirical data. Prior models frequently rely on generalized or static parameters, which can further exacerbate prediction inaccuracies, particularly when estimating infection spread in complex and heterogeneous network environments. Such inaccuracies limit their ability to support timely and effective threat response. To address this gap, this article presents a novel hybrid framework that integrates attack graphs with epidemic modeling. Attack graphs provide a structured representation of potential attack paths and interdependencies within a network, enabling the incorporation of real, context-aware values into the epidemic model. This integration enhances parameter accuracy and improves predictive capability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework (PFW) achieves a 91.25% improvement in performance. More specifically, the results indicate that the average number of infected devices using the proposed method with an attack graph for multivulnerabilities is 5, while for single-vulnerability cases it is 18. In comparison, traditional epidemic models without attack graph integration result in an average of 70 infected devices. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in minimizing infection spread under diverse vulnerability conditions. Overall, the results demonstrate the value of grounding epidemic models in realistic network conditions, thereby advancing adaptive threat modeling, proactive defense strategies, and informed decision-making. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and real-world application, offering a significant step toward practical epidemic-based approaches in cybersecurity."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Face expression recognition (FER) has been extensively explored by the research community, with comparisons between different FER models typically relying on accuracy metrics. To make model decisions more interpretable, evaluation can be complemented with the usage of (model-agnostic) explainability tools, leading to explainable FER models (XFER). However, the effectiveness of explainability tools in the context of XFER is seldom evaluated. This paper proposes a framework, entitled \"face expression recognition explainability evaluation framework, based on action units\" (XFER-AU), for evaluating the quality of explanations provided by different explainability tools in the context of XFER. To establish a comparison term, XFER-AU automatically generates a FER explanation ground truth, based on facial action units (AU). The proposed framework thus enables the comparison of explainability tools in terms of their ability to explain the decision made by an FER model. To perform the comparison, an evaluation metric called weighted explainability score (WES) is proposed, which takes into account the number of ground truth AUs covered and the precision of the explainability map produced. The proposed framework is used to compare several explainability tools, notably Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME), Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP), Average Removal/ Aggregation (AVG), Minus and PLUS explanation (MinPLUS) and Randomised Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE). The proposed XFER-AU results report that, for the tested datasets, LIME explanations tend to better align with the ground truth. In more challenging scenarios, the FER models struggle to effectively point to the facial AUs relevant to explaining the observed expression, thereby reducing the model’s decision confidence. Results also show that even when an expression is correctly classified, older FER models, such as those based on VGG-16, support their decision on a smaller number of the relevant AUs when compared to more recent models, such as EfficientNet-B0."

    "abstract": "Under global warming, Chongqing, China has seen rising frequencies of extreme heat, severely impacting residents’ lives, production, and the urban ecosystem. Accurately predicting future extreme heat year (hereinafter referred to as extreme heat) is crucial for ecological protection, energy management, and infrastructure planning. Using historical temperature data, this study defines extreme heat via the quantile method, ensuring regional representativeness. To address the limitations of traditional forecasting methods in predicting extreme heat characterized by “small sample sizes and complex influencing factors,” we have proposed a new grey disaster prediction model. The new model introduces a three-element adjacent mean generation operator and uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for global optimization of its key parameters. Applying this model to Chongqing, China’s 1951–2024 extreme heat, we predict the next three occurrences will be in 2026, 2029, and 2031. This model offers a new approach to extreme heat prediction and supports urban heatwave emergency response optimization, aiding high-temperature disaster prevention and sustainable ecological development."

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) has become a key technique for enhancing wireless devices in terms of computation performance by enabling task offloading to proximate edge servers. However, the performance of MEC networks is often limited by unfavorable wireless propagation conditions, which degrade the reliability of communication links required for efficient task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have recently been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate these challenges by intelligently reconfiguring the wireless environment through passive beamforming, where the phase shifts of reflecting elements are adjusted to reshape the propagation channel. Nevertheless, single-RIS deployments generally provide limited signal coverage, which is insufficient to support spatially distributed users. To overcome this limitation, this paper explores a MEC framework supported by multiple RISs, where several surfaces are strategically placed to jointly improve network connectivity and computational efficiency. A joint optimization framework is established to enhance the system-wide computation efficiency by simultaneously optimizing user-RIS association, RIS passive beamforming, and the allocation of communication and computation resources. To tackle this highly non-convex problem, we propose an efficient hierarchical optimization framework, termed hierarchical computational efficiency resource allocation (H-CERA). This framework adopts an outer-loop algorithm based on the Dinkelbach method to transform the original sum-of-ratios objective into a tractable form, and an inner-loop alternating optimization procedure to iteratively update the decoupled variable blocks. Comprehensive simulation experiments confirm that the proposed H-CERA framework is effective, showing substantial improvements in computational efficiency over representative baseline schemes. The results further demonstrate its robustness and scalability under diverse system configurations."

    "abstract": "Cooperative-integrated sensing and communication (C-ISAC) networks have emerged as promising solutions for communication and target sensing. However, imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation and time synchronization (TS) errors degrade performance, affecting communication and sensing accuracy. This paper addresses these challenges by employing movable antennas (MAs) to enhance C-ISAC robustness. We analyze the impact of CSI errors on achievable rates and introduce a hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRLB) to evaluate the effect of TS errors on target localization accuracy. Based on these models, we derive the worst-case achievable rate and sensing precision under such errors. We optimize cooperative beamforming, base station (BS) selection factor and MA position to minimize power consumption while ensuring accuracy. We then propose a constrained deep reinforcement learning (C-DRL) approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem, using a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm with a Wolpertinger architecture for efficient training under complex constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly integrates TS errors and imperfect CSI into a unified MA-aided cooperative ISAC framework, providing a physically consistent model for both communication and sensing under dual uncertainties. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves system robustness against CSI and TS errors, where robustness mean reliable data transmission under poor channel conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of MA technology to reduce power consumption in imperfect CSI and TS environments."

    "abstract": "When an urban rail vehicle moves, its receptor obtains the current from the contact rail (CR) through the sliding friction. Thus, the receptor could be subject to localized overheating, which causes increased wear and even damage. Based on the dynamic equilibrium equations of the heat transfer and dissipation between the receptor and the CR (referred to as the boot and rail, BAR), and the dynamic electric contact theory, a three-dimensional thermal field model for the BAR system during the vehicle motion is established. The effects of the current, contact force, and motion speed on the temperature rise of the BAR are discussed. The results show that the current is the main factor affecting the temperature rise of the BAR, which exhibits a positive correlation. The temperature decreases with the increase of the contact force. Especially the temperature rise decreases the fastest when the contact force varies from 100 to 120 N, 2.86 times that when it varies from 80 to 100 N, 9.1 times that when it varies from 120 to 140 N. Also the temperature increases with the speed. And the temperature difference from 80 to 100 km/h is 1.5 times that from 60 to 80 km/h. The innovation of this paper lies in comprehensively deriving the formula for the total dynamic contact heat source power based on electrical contact theory and friction theory. A new three-dimensional dynamic thermal field finite element model for the BAR is established. And the trail effect near the electrical contact zone (ECZ) of the CR is researched. The contribution is that the research results are of the reference for the local thermal protection of the receptor and its structural optimization."

Current research predominantly relies on random DoS attack strategies that fail to account for adversarial intentionality and high-intensity behavioral patterns inherent to cyber threats. To address this limitation, we propose an asynchronous optimal DoS (AODoS) attacks algorithm specifically designed for energy-constrained adversaries. The algorithm strategically optimizes channel selection to maximize consensus error. To counteract such attacks, secure control strategies integrating event-triggered and self-triggered mechanisms is developed to achieve resilient bipartite consensus of MASs. Theoretical analysis derives sufficient conditions for ensuring consensus convergence under AODoS attacks. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in mitigating high-intensity DoS attacks."

To address these issues, this article introduces a multimodal vision-tactile sensor framework based on synchronized multicamera sensing. We further propose a self-calibrating multimodal fusion photometric stereoneural network, which not only reconstructs high-fidelity contact surface geometry but also incorporates an LED-based renderer to synthesize diverse tactile images under novel lighting conditions. A unified joint calibration method is also developed to simultaneously optimize geometric, optical, and normal force parameters, significantly simplifying sensor setup and improving measurement accuracy. Experimental validation shows that our sensor, GelSplitter, achieves a 28.2% reduction in surface normal error while producing cleaner reconstructions with fewer artifacts. The integrated renderer synthesizes high-quality tactile images with a PSNR of 30.22 dB, outperforming single-light source methods by 6.33 dB. The effectiveness of the proposed system is further demonstrated in three downstream tactile tasks: pose estimation, fingerprint recognition, and slip detection."

However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and sub-graph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

    "abstract": "Multi-UAV cooperative path planning (MUCPP) is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, aiming to generate collision-free trajectories for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to complete distributed tasks efficiently. A key challenge lies in achieving both efficiency, by minimizing total mission cost, and fairness, by balancing the workload among UAVs to avoid overburdening individual agents. This paper presents a novel Iterative Exchange Framework for MUCPP, balancing efficiency and fairness through iterative task exchanges and path refinements. The proposed framework formulates a composite objective that combines the total mission distance and the makespan, and iteratively improves the solution via local exchanges under feasibility and safety constraints. For each UAV, collision-free trajectories are generated using A $^{*}$ search over a terrainaware configuration space. Comprehensive experiments on multiple terrain datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior trade-offs between total distance and makespan compared to existing baselines."

    "abstract": "Tropospheric delays caused by the differences in pressure, temperature and humidity of observation between the master and slave images are one of the main errors affecting the accuracy of the deformation inversion of Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques. We propose a Cross-seasonal Common-master (CSCM) Interferograms Subsets method to accurately estimate the tropospheric delays of master and slave images. Firstly, the characteristic of the tropospheric delays being strong in summer and weak in winter is used to generate the cross-seasonal common-master interferograms subsets. Then, the tropospheric delays are estimated by modeling each subset. We validate the Sentinel-1A/B atmospheric delays correction in Sydney. The results show the RMSE between the InSAR deformation with atmospheric correction by our method and the GPS measurements is 7.6 mm, which is 49% lower than that before tropospheric correction, i.e. 14.7 mm. Therefore, the new method provides an accurate and efficient means for the tropospheric delay estimation of Sentinel-1 data, which can be applied to atmospheric water vapor inversion and high precision surface deformation monitoring."

    "abstract": "A distributed machine learning framework allows multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sending data away from the data-generating device. This approach, known as federated learning (FL), involves decentralized clients contributing to build their own local model with a shared global model. However, this framework inevitably generates significant data communication exchanges between clients and the central server, which can produce overhead traffic in the network and potentially degrade quality of service (QoS) and network efficiency. To alleviate this problem, we proposed client selection methods in federated learning, enabling the system to strategically involve only the most suitable clients in each training round. This study proposes a stability-based client selection method, in which clients are evaluated according to the consistency of their local training behaviour, ensuring that only stable participants are prioritized to build an updated global model. The experimental results demonstrate that applying this stability-based client selection method in the FL system achieves an average network efficiency improvement of 46.88%, indicating a substantial reduction in communication overhead and enhancing network quality by addressing potential bottlenecks."

In this paper, we propose an advanced approach for classifying dermatologic images used in the diagnosis of skin diseases. Our approach involves three main steps: first, an image preprocessing stage removes artifacts from input data; second, region-of-interest segmentation employs the U-Net architecture; third, classification utilizes an ensemble model that combines the strengths of ResNet convolutional neural networks and the Vision Transformer architecture. Experiments were carried out on the widely recognized HAM10000 dataset. During these experiments, our proposed approach demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.57%, a macro-averaged AUC-ROC score of 1.00, and a micro-averaged F1-score of 0.99. Importantly, it also achieved very high levels of both specificity (98.87%) and sensitivity (93.44%), making it particularly suitable for use in medical diagnostic settings. Visualizations generated by the Grad-CAM technique further confirmed the clinical interpretability of the model's predictions. These findings suggest substantial promise for the application of our approach in developing decision-support systems aimed at improving the diagnosis of skin diseases."

Traditionally, behavioral analyzes have relied on manual video inspection, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has improved data collection through efficient and noninvasive aerial monitoring. However, this advancement has led to a substantial increase in the volume of video footage, intensifying the burden of manual review. To address this challenge, we propose a computer vision–based solution that integrates deep learning techniques for the automatic detection and tracking of whales on UAV footage. Using the YOLOv8 model for object detection and the DeepSORT algorithm for real-time multi-object tracking, our system successfully identified and followed humpback whales across varied video sequences. Visual evaluation of the results demonstrated consistent detection accuracy, maintaining spatial coherence even under varying lighting conditions and surface disturbances. The system’s ability to capture detailed movement patterns and behavioral sequences suggests strong potential for supporting qualitative behavioral assessments. This approach streamlines data processing and facilitates in-depth observation of whale behavior in natural settings, thereby contributing to improved conservation practices."

    "abstract": "The paper introduces a new Adaptive Decentralised Real-Time Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication Framework designed to enhance the efficiency of collision avoidance in autonomous vehicle (AV) networks. When AVs are found on more roads, fast and dependable communication between the vehicles is vital to avoid accidents and increase traffic safety. The framework introduces edge computing inside the vehicles, enabling them to process the data gathered by several sensors on the spot, thus cutting latency. Thanks to a blockchain-inspired decentralized protocol, all messages are authenticated and remain reliable without requiring central servers, thus increasing security. An AI-based collision forecasting system checks the collected sensor signals to predict collisions fast and take quick preemptive actions. It prioritizes the delivery of important messages and manages the device’s bandwidth by sending the signals only when needed. It also helps by switching available channels cleverly to prevent communication interruptions and overcrowding. Working together, models updates make the network better, and all data is kept confidential during this process. The results of the simulation explain that collision rates, time between messages, and network delays are reduced more than in current V2V systems. This approach makes it easy to avoid collisions in real time and offers good security, which also makes it simple for AVs to communicate with other vehicles on the roads. The suggested method is expected to make roads safer, increase traffic flow smoothness, and speed up the adoption of trustworthy autonomous vehicles."

Cost-curve is often a piecewise continuous function and the derivative of the cost- curve with respect to the power gives the incremental operating cost. Total load of the 5-bus system is 824.5 MW, allowing the generator units to have automatic generation control for optimizing the best economic dispatch.

Feature-based methods, compared to intensity-based or transform-based techniques, are particularly effective in aligning histopathology images due to their robustness against variations in staining, lighting, and tissue deformation. These methods allow for precise comparison and interpretation of tissue samples, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. In this study, we employ the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) detector to generate key points and use the BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) algorithm for feature matching. The ORB detector is advantageous due to its computational efficiency and invariance to rotation and scale, making it ideal for histopathological applications. To further enhance performance, adaptive thresholding is incorporated in ORB for improved feature detection in varying intensity regions. Additionally, RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is applied for robust outlier rejection, ensuring accurate alignment of histopathology images. This combination has demonstrated successful results in aligning histopathology images, ensuring high accuracy and consistency. The proposed method effectively addresses challenges posed by variations in tissue appearance, contributing to improved diagnostic precision and research in medical imaging."

In this work, ECG denoising was implemented in the LabVIEW environment by simulating noisy signals with the Biomedical Toolkit, applying wavelet filtering with several families, and adaptive filtering with LMS and RLS algorithms, followed by performance evaluation using signal-tonoise ratio (SNR).

    "abstract": "The amount of energy used by standard streetlights in cities is a genuine concern, particularly when few cars are on the streets. Each light in these places works at maximum brightness, leading to energy waste and environmental harm. Sustainability in smart cities can be reached when suitable energy-efficient solutions are available for changing traffic demands. A system is discussed in this research that adjusts its light output according to the amount of traffic on the street in real time. The combination of IoT sensors, observing areas such as streets, and a central control system allows traffic conditions to decide the brightness of streetlights. A basic rule is used to control streetlight brightness: they are brightest when there is high traffic, dimmer if traffic is moderate, and either dim or off during low or no traffic. It saves power and guarantees everyone using the streets will feel securely illuminated. A simulation of the proposed system shows that energy usage can be reduced by as much as 70% when most people are not using the system, without endangering the public. If developed, this system is scalable, low in cost, and able to adapt, making it useful for urban regions hoping to save energy and maintain public safety. As a result, this system significantly reduces streetlighting’s effects on the environment and contributes to building more intelligent and greener cities."

This study presents a GANbased approach to hospital staff schedule generation that takes into account limitations including role-based requirements, legal compliance, and personal preferences. A generator that suggests schedules and a discriminator that evaluates their viability and quality are both components of the GAN architecture. These schedules are improved by iterative training, increasing their usefulness in practical settings. The GAN is useful in complicated healthcare scheduling situations because it uses previous patient load and staff data to dynamically adapt to hospital demands, improving scheduling accuracy, workload distribution, and response to unforeseen changes."

    "abstract": "Emerging low-voltage direct current (LVDC) micro-grids represent a compelling alternative for efficient renewable energy use in multiple residential and industrial scenarios. Typical concerns regarding safety of DC systems are currently being addressed through the sustained development and deployment of solid-state circuit breakers (SSCBs) and current limiter (CL) devices. Design of such elements requires suitable simulation approaches and tools for accurate understanding of short-circuit current behavior under multiple usage and parametrisation scenarios, in accordance to established norms and regulations. This paper presents a co-simulation approach to derive short-circuit current profiles in a typical off-grid home setting supplied by solar energy. The implementation has been carried out by integration of Simulink models with the TyphoonHIL environment for real-time simulation through the dedicated FMU/FMI interface. We report on the numerical results achieved and derive insights for improved protection of LVDC microgrids."

However, capturing clear images is challenging due to the scattering and absorption of light and water pollution, which leads to low contrast and a blue or green cast. These issues cause degradation in image quality which makes the analysis of underwater images more complicated. This paper presents a hybrid mean-max color correction algorithm with contrast enhancement, to enhance the quality of underwater images. The proposed method improves contrast and restores natural colors, thus addressing the common visual distortions caused by light degradation. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been demonstrated by enhancing the image quality of 16 different types of underwater images."

    "abstract": "The role for Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverters (CHB-MLIs) is becoming increasingly critical for interfacing renewable sources with electrical grid. The integration into the grid requires high-quality power conversion and CHB-MLIs are particularly advantageous for this goal because of their modular structure and enhanced output quality. In addition, the employed control strategy in these inverters determines the overall performance and efficiency. This paper investigates a dedicated analysis of a Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) for 7-level grid-connected CHB-MLI. The system, including the inverter and an LCL filter, is modeled in Simulink/MALTAB, and the evaluation of the performance is carried out by measuring the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the injected grid current and assessing its robustness under grid fluctuations. The analysis finds out that FCS-MPC shows a high efficiency, ability to select optimal switching states, integrate multiple control objectives, such as grid current tracking and DC-link voltage balancing, capacity to address system constraints and notable improvements in power quality. The results demonstrate the critical role of advanced control methods to maximize the performance of grid-connected CHB-MLIs in renewable energy systems."

    "abstract": "Deep Learning-based Side-Channel Analysis (DLSCA) has demonstrated its potent attack capability against cryptographic systems, enabling the extraction of secret information from leaked physical signal traces. Unfortunately, the availability of real traces for classifier training is often limited due to restricted data collection or protective countermeasures. The generation and enhancement of signal trace is crucial in practical DL-SCA analysis. Existing methods often struggle to accurately model the feature distribution of real traces, and their applicability to emerging post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose DMSCT, an attention-enhanced diffusion model framework for side-channel trace generation. DM-SCT precisely models the feature distributions of real traces through a conditional injection mechanism and an enhanced attention mechanism. We evaluate DM-SCT across three PQC algorithms: NTRU, Saber, and Kyber, demonstrating its ability to faithfully replicate the leakage features of original side-channel traces. By integrating DM-SCT into DL-SCA, we validate its practical efficacy. Compared to training with real traces alone, DM-SCT improves the accuracy of recovering individual key coefficients by 0.62% to 1.6%. Furthermore, DM-SCT reduces the required number of real training traces by 20% to 25%, outperforming state-of-the-art trace generation methods."

We first identify the worst-case initial conditions yielding maximum deviation.

    "abstract": "Sharing patient data safely and efficiently is still hard in the constantly changing world of digital healthcare because of worries about privacy, giving consent, and how different systems work together. This paper suggests using ChainMedX, which relies on blockchain technology to let patients, doctors, and other healthcare professionals exchange data in real time with dynamic consent consent management. ChainMedX uses permissions, smart contracts, and zero-knowledge proofs to let patients pick who can have access to their medical records, manage exactly what is shared, and specify the time period the sharing is needed, making sure those permissions cannot be altered. Being distributed across both cloud and edge servers, the patient-managed encrypted data vaults make active updates of medical records possible, complying with FHIR standards. Thanks to an AI-based consent suggestion module, patients receive useful advice that suits their needs and the current emergency situation. In addition, ChainMedX deals with urgent issues, such as fast access with easy ‘break-glass’ rules and complete tracking of every transaction, and makes it easier for healthcare services to interact with the wider health organization and verify insurance policies. According to the results, latency, security, and managing consent are all better in the new system than in systems that operate centrally or rely on blockchain. The research mentions that connecting blockchain, edge computing, and privacy-based cryptography can form a healthcare system that respects patient data privacy and makes healthcare cooperation speedy and secure. The goal of this framework is to help provide for data exchange between countries, while including new forms of digital health technology, all this aims to strengthen patient trust and the integrity of their medical data, along with providing better healthcare outcomes."

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the influence of distance-based clustering on the performance of Ensemble Learning models for cellular signal prediction. The methodology involved collecting drive test and operator data, followed by data preprocessing and feature engineering. The data was then clustered by distance using Quantile Binning and Fixed Interval methods. Various ensemble models were evaluated across three modeling scenarios: a specific model per cluster, a global model (baseline), and a global model with an added cluster feature. The results consistently demonstrate that the global model (baseline) approach delivered the most accurate and robust performance, with the Stacking model achieving the best results (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.80). The initial hypothesis, which stated that prediction error would increase with distance, was definitively rejected. In-depth analysis revealed that the error peaked at mid-range distances (100-250 meters), attributed to the high volatility of the actual signal in complex local environments like urban canyons. This finding proves that unmodeled local environmental factors have a more dominant influence on prediction difficulty than signal attenuation due to distance alone, offering the insight that more detailed geospatial features are needed to improve model accuracy in the future."

A systematic preprocessing pipeline is applied to improve data quality, incorporating advanced text normalization for categorical features. Among several state-of-the-art machine learning models evaluated, CatBoost demonstrated superior performance. Its hyperparameters were optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to further improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

This work presents Top-K periodic high utility itemsets mining (TOPKPHM), a Top-K approach that addresses threshold specification by dynamically maintaining the utility value at the K-th rank position. TOPKPHM employs the Estimated Utility & Support Co-Occurrence Structure (EUSCS) for unified utility and support management. An enhanced utility-list structure integrates periodicity constraints directly, eliminating separate data structure overhead. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show TOPKPHM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving execution time reductions of multiple times compared to traditional methods on the chess dataset while maintaining consistent memory efficiency.

    "abstract": "Compared to traditional single-sensor data-based techniques, multi-source data provides complementary information about land cover targets, making it a hot research direction for improving the segmentation performance of land cover. However, multi-source data-based segmentation faces significant challenges due to the domain shifts in heterogeneous data, substantial sensitivity differences, imbalanced class distributions, and the limited availability of well-matched heterogeneous data samples. Therefore, A Prior Feature-injected Cross-Attention auto-Encoder(PF-CAE) is proposed using optical and SAR Images. First, an unsupervised prior feature injection module is designed to reduce the reliance on training data. Specifically, it utilizes maximum-based texture features, and magnitude-based strong scattering features extracted from optical and SAR images, respectively, as prior constraint features, emphasizing the strengths of heterogeneous data in segmenting different land cover types. Second, a transformer-based cross-attention feature module is introduced, which facilitates the extraction and learning of semantically consistent features while suppressing interference from redundant or irrelevant unique features. Finally, a class-weighted cross-entropy loss function is developed to address the imbalanced class distributions. Experimental results on the WHU-OPT-SAR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed PF-CAE, achieving an average improvement of 3.5 % in the Kappa compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "The article analyzes the problems and methods of research, development, and implementation of control theory and machine learning in industrial corporation. A model of organization of corporate production is built and studied, at the top level of which is the Principal, at the middle - the Representative and at the bottom — the Agent. The interaction between the Principal and the Representative was studied, and the features of their strategic behavior were identified. An optimal mechanism of control of the Representative on the part of the Principal, aimed at revealing the production potential, is proposed. The nature of the interaction between the Representative and the Agent and their strategic behavior is determined. The procedures of reinforcement learning of the Representative and motivation of the Agent are considered. An optimal mechanism of control of the Agent on the part of the Representative is developed. Based on the obtained results, a comprehensive mechanism for corporate management has been formed, which motivates active elements of an industrial corporation to increase production. The obtained results are applied in the service management system of Russian Railways corporation."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Modern high-speed SerDes and clock/data recovery (CDR) systems heavily rely on phase interpolators (PI) to generate accurate clocks for timing critical paths. As data rates continue to scale, achieving linear code-to-phase transfer becomes increasingly difficult due to device nonidealities, shrinking supply voltages, and tighter jitter budgets. Nonlinearity in the interpolator directly degrades timing accuracy, leading to higher bit-error rates (BER). This work explores methods to improve interpolator linearity in CMOS inverter-based mixer architectures. The three methods are: digital predisposition, an ac-coupled feedback inverter at the input, and reduced supply operation of the mixer stage. Simulation results show that the combination of these methods effectively flattens the code-to-phrase characteristics and reduces integral nonlinearity. Trade-offs are added circuit complexity, area and jitter. The results demonstrate that with modest design, the proposed methods provide a practical way toward more accurate PIs in advanced SerDes and CDR applications."

The numerical values were acquired for a wide range of operating pressure and residence time. The CFD results indicate that the Kinetic theory models overpredicts the CH<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</inf> conversion by 66% on average. The Constant model underpredicts the results by 38% on average. The Bosanquet approximation and Lewis number values were quite close for all cases considered. This implies that Lewis number model may be used for CFD model simplification."

Although numerous studies benchmark SLAM algorithms, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding direct, cross-paradigm comparisons, evaluating systems based on disparate sensor modalities under identical conditions on public datasets. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation of several state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms. The EKF, MSCKF, OKVIS, ORB-SLAM3, F-LOAM and LVI-SAM algorithms are qualitatively compared, but only the last four algorithms were evaluated using the publicly available KITTI (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute) dataset. The findings indicate that ORB-SLAM3 provides the highest accuracy in both position and orientation estimation on the chosen KITTI sequences. The results highlight a critical trade-off between the high precision of visual-based methods in suitable environments and the increased robustness offered by multi-sensor fusion systems."

Even though, the conflict between farmers and wildlife remains a significant challenge even today. It is essential to arrange the protection of fields and farms by deterring wild animals and predators without making harm to the wildlife. This study proposes a framework that can detect and classify animals or intruders or any natural calamities. The novelty of the study is deterring the wild animals using innocuous devices and chemical components instead of the harmful electric fences and other methods. Based on the classification it will take preventive measures and will send an alert to the Farmer. The preventive measures are ensuring that will not make any harm to the wild animals. The framework incorporated four major components PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensor, Raspberry Pi Camera, Scarecrow and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) Module. PIR Sensor detects an object, Raspberry Pi Camera captures the images and images classify the specific object, later based on the type of the animal the scare tactics will be applied by the scarecrow and if any unusual incident is happening like the presence of an intruder, fire or tornado the alert will send to the Farmer with the help of a GSM Module."

    "abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSSR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is widely used in target detection. However, its low signal power and narrow bandwidth directly lead to low radar imaging resolution and significant noise impact. Because of the low resolution of GNSS-R SAR, high sampling rate is required during sampling. This leads to the large size of the imaging matrix, which affects the imaging speed. And low rank leads to the ill-posedness of its observation matrix. Therefore, in order to improve its imaging speed and alleviate its ill-posedness, we propose a fast range super-resolution imaging based on TSVD dimensionality reduction combined with FISTA. In the proposed method, the matrix dimension reduction is carried out to reduce the amount of data processing and accelerate the speed of the algorithm. Since the TSVD technique alleviates the ill-posedness of the measurement matrix, the L1 norm constraint is introduced to construct the objective function by using the sparse characteristics of the target from the regularization. Finally, the approximate solution is found by solving the objective function with the fast iterative threshold shrinkage method of adaptive step size. The simulation results show that this method not only improves the resolution accuracy of GNSS-R SAR, but also greatly accelerates the speed of the fast iterative threshold shrinkage method."

    "abstract": "Older adults in Ireland face critical cybersecurity challenges that impact their digital security posture, risk perception, and online engagement. Through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 77 participants aged 60 and above, we identify key barriers, including cybersecurity knowledge gaps, usability challenges with authentication mechanisms, and a lack of accessible security support. Participants report concerns about online fraud, privacy risks, and the overwhelming nature of security advice, which often results in digital disengagement. By categorizing participants by technology usage–low, medium, and high, we uncover distinct cybersecurity behaviors. Greater technology use is often accompanied by increased awareness of cyber threats; however, this does not necessarily translate into secure practices, as many continue to struggle with two-factor authentication (2FA) and secure password management. Medium-usage participants exhibit high anxiety over scams and rely on family for security support, while low-usage individuals, though less exposed to threats, remain at risk due to a lack of foundational digital skills and reliance on avoidance-based security strategies. Our findings highlight the urgent need for targeted cybersecurity education, simplified authentication systems, and age-appropriate security interventions to enhance digital confidence, cyber resilience, and online inclusion among older adults, ensuring their secure and equitable participation in an increasingly digital society."

While many fake voice detectors achieve strong performance in controlled settings, they often overfit to speaker-irrelative features (SiFs), exhibit poor robustness, and fail in multi-speaker scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose MultiSiFer, a novel fake voice detector grounded in a new design philosophy: rather than merely distinguishing synthetic from human voices, it explicitly prioritizes learning essential human voice characteristics. MultiSiFer leverages a pre-trained speech representation model to enhance this learning and is the first detector trained on a newly curated multi-speaker fake voice dataset, enabling effective generalization across speakers. Experiments show that MultiSiFer outperforms existing methods in both standard and multi-speaker settings, achieving 10.84% average equal error rate (EER)."

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop LLM-driven UAV operation code generation framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into semantic trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM’s understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity."

    "abstract": "Under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm, wireless networks are evolving into multifunctional platforms that seamlessly combine data transmission with high-precision ranging for applications such as indoor navigation, asset tracking, and context-aware Internet of Things (IoT). The Multi-Carrier Phase Difference (MCPD) method has emerged as an effective technique for enabling localization in narrowband communication systems by estimating the channel frequency response (CFR) used for distance estimation. Converting the two-way CFR (TWCFR) into a one-way CFR (OWCFR) provides a physically consistent representation of the propagation channel and thus improves the ranging performance. However, existing channel reconstruction (CR) methods rely on noise-sensitive phase unwrapping which degrades in the presence of noise and interference, common in dense IoT deployments and crowded frequency bands. To address these limitations, we propose a noise-resistant OWCFR reconstruction algorithm that utilizes a peak-driven adaptive windowing strategy to generate a reference TWCFR for reliable square-root branch selection and incorporates a delay alignment correction to restore the maximum unambiguous range. Simulation and experimental results using IEEE 802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) compliant devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust and accurate distance estimation in more than 99.8% of interference scenarios."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require high-capacity, low-latency memory systems to process large graphs. A hierarchical hybrid memory architecture combining high-capacity Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and low-latency DRAM offers a promising solution. However, the inherent sparsity of graph data results in poor locality for GNN memory requests, leading to low DRAM cache hit rates and numerous misses, which significantly impairs the hybrid memory system’s performance. A critical issue is that DRAM misses in serial access mode incur substantial latency. While parallel access mode can mitigate this for misses, it introduces long-tail latency and wastes bandwidth for DRAM hits. In this paper, we focus on addressing these issues from two aspects: increasing the cache hit rate and decreasing the miss latency. We mainly propose two predictors: a future data access predictor that enables accurate prefetching to DRAM, thereby improving cache hit rates, and a data location predictor that determines whether data resides in DRAM or NVM, optimizing the choice between serial and parallel access modes to reduce miss latency. By integrating these predictors, we achieve efficient data access in both DRAM and NVM. Our experiments show a 49.5% reduction in memory delay and a 38.1% increase in memory bandwidth utilization compared to baseline."

In K-band rectification at an input power of 100 mW or less, it is analytically clarified that the 0.18 μm GaAs E-pHEMT GAD, manufactured using a standard GaAs process, exhibited a rectification efficiency within 2% of that of the commercially available GaAs Schottky barrier diode (SBD) (MACOM MA4E1317) widely used in millimeter wave systems. For the K-band 1 W rectifier MMIC demonstrated in this paper, multi-stage series-connected GaAs E-pHEMT GADs with a wider gate width are used to achieve high-power rectification with high efficiency. For the prototyped K-band 1 W rectifier MMIC, the gate width and the stage number of the series-connected GADs are optimized and a rectification efficiency of 64% at 26.5 GHz is achieved. This is the highest value reported for 50 Ω matched watt-class rectifiers. The results confirm that the proposed design approach with the GaAs E-pHEMT GAD is effective for high-power rectification in the K-band."

    "abstract": "The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) paradigm empowers individuals to manage their own credentials by storing them in digital wallets under their full control. In SSI, a credential embeds a list of claims representing personal attributes of the holder, and it is digitally signed by the issuer. When requested, the holder submits some of their credentials to a verifier to prove some of their attributes (e.g., being of legal age). However, to protect their privacy, the holder might want to disclose to the verifier only a subset of the claims embedded in each of the credentials they share, thus requiring a mechanism for hiding the other claims without invalidating the digital signatures of the credentials. This paper surveys the approaches enabling a subject to disclose only selected claims from a signed credential, known as Selective Disclosure. These approaches define the protocol the issuer should follow to construct the credentials, and the holder should follow to disclose only the claims they wish. We examined five approaches, based on: atomic credentials, hashing, encryption, hash trees, and signature, and we compare them from both a qualitative and quantitative point of view. In order to perform an unbiased quantitative evaluation, we developed a reference implementation for each approach and we assessed their performance in executing the same SSI operations on the same credentials. In particular, we measured the time required to create and verify credentials and presentations, as well as the size they take, varying both the number of claims in the credentials and the percentage of disclosed ones in the presentations. The proposed qualitative and experimental comparison is meant to support application designers in understanding which of the available selective disclosure approach is more convenient for their application scenarios."

    "abstract": "Objective: The development of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has enabled animals to execute movements in accordance with human intent. The rat robot represents a novel robotic system based on BCI technology. However, due to limitations in electrode fabrication techniques and the use of simplistic control strategies, current rat robots are restricted to limited movement patterns, which hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we have developed a portable wireless neural stimulator and a novel 3D integrated stimulating electrode. By refining the locomotion control strategy, we aim to achieve complex, high-degree-of-freedom movement in rat robot systems. Methods: 3D integrated electrodes were implanted into the rats' head, with no reward-based training required. By utilizing a wearable wireless stimulation backpack to connect the electrodes and deliver electrical stimulation to multiple brain regions, thereby enabling the rat to perform forward movement, turning, and stopping behaviors. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that under optimized stimulation parameters, the forward speed of the rat robot can be controlled to achieve 31.06 ± 1.21 m/min, the turning angle can reach up to 150 ± 1.22°, and the stopping duration can be flexibly adjusted. Furthermore, we presented a practical scenario in which the rat robot successfully executed a predefined navigation task in a real-world environment, thereby validating its high degree of movement flexibility and control precision. Conclusion: This study achieved high-degree-of-freedom motion control of rat robots without the need for reward-based training, which was previously unattainable. Significance: This research establishes a crucial foundation and provides valuable technical references for the application of animal robots in fields such as information reconnaissance and wreckage search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "Vector instruction set architectures (ISAs) play a critical role in accelerating data-parallel computation, yet mainstream designs—such as the RISC-V “V” Vector Extension (RVV) – still rely on rigid, power-of-two register grouping strategies. These limitations hinder performance when handling ultra-long vectors or non-uniform workloads, as they require extensive strip-mining and careful low-level tuning to maintain efficiency. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Zoozve</i>, a flexible, strip-mining-free extension to the RISC-V vector ISA. Zoozve introduces an arbitrary register grouping mechanism that enables more precise register utilization and eliminates the need for data slicing across multiple loop iterations. This work presents a full-stack realization of Zoozve, including (1) a hardware-compatible ISA with support for flexible vector lengths and asymmetric instructions, (2) a compiler backend based on LLVM that performs intrinsic splitting, register allocation with live-interval modification, and instruction coalescing, and (3) a hardware proof-of-concept implementation that integrates hazard detection and a register-level element exchange engine. Experimental evaluation using instruction-level simulation shows that Zoozve achieves up to 344.44× speedup in fast Fourier transform (FFT), 76× in dot product, 58.92× in axpy, and 20.41× in 2D convolution compared to RVV, primarily by eliminating strip-mining and improving register reuse. Register transfer level (RTL) synthesis in a 40 nm process shows that Zoozve’s additional hardware logic incurs only 9% area overhead, confirming its feasibility for real-world deployment. Together, these results demonstrate Zoozve’s potential as a scalable and efficient vector processing solution for high-performance computing, machine learning, and signal processing."

Online monitoring of gate oxide degradation significantly enhances device operational reliability. This paper proposes an online method for monitoring gate oxide degradation in SiC MOSFETs using turn-on current rise time. Firstly, the influence of gate oxide degradation on turn-on current rise time is investigated through theoretical modeling. Secondly, the effectiveness of analytical analysis is validated via experiments. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the package degradation does not affect turn-on current rise time. Thirdly, an operational monitor circuit of turn-on current rise time is designed, and the feasibility of this monitoring approach to detect the variation in turn-on current rise time is validated through simulation. This non-invasive method offers strong real-time capability, providing an effective approach for online SiC MOSFETs health assessment and system reliability prediction."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of international aviation has significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions. The existing type of jet fuel consumes a considerable amount of crude oil, which has compounded the demand. As a result, the industry accounts for a carbon footprint that reduces the pressure on alternative energy sources with lower carbon emissions. Agricultural waste comprises straw, husks, and stalks, which denotes one such available lignocellulosic feedstock that is not exhaustively utilised to offer a solution to environmental and economic dilemmas in the aviation energy production. The given research paper proposes an integrated solution to transform agricultural waste materials into high-energy-density biofuels, which can be utilised in the aviation industry through a two-stage biochemical and thermochemical treatment, followed by subsequent fuel upgrading to produce a high-quality product. Pre-treatment options, which were attempted on a lab scale, included steam explosion, dilute acid hydrolysis, enzyme saccharification, fermentation, pyrolysis, and Fischer-Tropsch catalytic upgrading. The parameters of the process conditions were optimised to achieve a high yield and minimise energy consumption. Results were statistically analysed to ensure reproducibility, and fuel properties were compared to ASTM D7566 standards to verify that they conformed to conventional jet fuel specifications. The results show that biofuels produced from agricultural waste have an energy density similar to that of Jet A fuel, with notable reductions in carbon and particulate emissions, making them a viable option for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions caused by aviation. The techno-economic analysis also demonstrates the viability of large-scale implementation, based on the availability of feedstock, process effectiveness, and compliance with regulations. The practice is also compatible with the principles of the circular economy, which emphasises the value of agricultural residues, agrarian economies, and sustainable waste management. Moreover, it is possible to optimise it with AI, emulate the use of blockchains to track feedstock, and adopt the concept of hybrid biofuel-electric to make the future of biofuel work more efficiently and easily tracked. Comprehensively, the paper demonstrates that agricultural waste can be a feasible and sustainable aviation biofeedstock of the next generation, as it can help minimise carbon footprints, make biofuels economically viable, and promote the current trend of carbon-neutral aircraft in the global community."

This research presents an Adaptive Security Operations Center (ASOC) that leverages rule-based mechanisms to optimize resource utilization and traffic analysis in real time. The ASOC adjusts its operations based on workload conditions: during low activity, it minimizes resource usage by performing autonomous analysis, reducing the need for human intervention, while under high-load conditions, it dynamically allocates additional resources and partially processes data to assist analysts. This adaptive approach ensures scalability, enhances operational efficiency, and balances computational and human resources, offering a more agile and effective solution to modern cybersecurity challenges."

Aiming at the challenges associated with traditional GAN-based reservoir modeling algorithms, such as excessive parameters, high computational demands, significant memory usage, and substantial resource consumption, a lightweight well and seismic fusion reservoir modeling network (LightGAN) is proposed. The network employs shallow convolutional neural networks combined with Wasserstein distances to achieve fast and accurate modeling. In order to verify the effectiveness of the improved method, sedimentary facies data are used for experimental detection. The results show that LightGAN improves accuracy by more than $6 \\%$ relative to the conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (CDCGAN) and shows incremental improvement over the state-of-the-art Generative facial prior GAN (GFPGAN).

However, despite the widespread use and urgent demand for humidity sensors, a fundamental challenge persists: the underlying sensing mechanisms, particularly at atomic and molecular levels, often remain inadequately understood.

In this study, a molybdenum trioxide/zinc oxide $\\left(\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}\\right)$ heterostructure was constructed and first-principles calculations were employed to conduct an in-depth investigation, at the atomic and electronic scales, into interfacial charge transfer at the $\\mathrm{MoO}_{3} / \\mathrm{ZnO}$ heterojunction and its adsorption characteristics toward water molecules.

This study evaluates state-of-the-art segmentation models, categorized into UNet-based, encoder-decoder, and transformer-based architectures, using a dataset focused on aquatic plant segmentation in a natural environment. The model is evaluated using Dice coefficient, F1 score, IoU and overall accuracy, along with computational complexity measured by parameter count and GFLOPs. Results indicate that backbone-enhanced models outperform base configurations by providing deeper and more robust feature representations. Then, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to evaluate the model attention and ensure the precise focus of the network on ecologically meaningful regions. These insights not only highlight the importance of architectural depth and input diversity but also demonstrate how XAI can support iterative model refinement. As a result of these combined efforts, segmentation performance is improved from a baseline dice coefficient and accuracy of 50.76 and 85.07 % to a maximum 75.57 and 94.94 % respectively. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights of selecting suitable models in resource-constrained environments and advances the development of robust segmentation systems."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for differentiated services in 5G networks has led to the adoption of network slicing to support heterogeneous use cases such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC). Traditional RAN architectures fall short in delivering isolated and service-specific performance. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept ORAN-aligned 5G slicing testbed built entirely using open-source components. The system integrates Open5GS as the 5G Core and UERANSIM for emulating gNB and UE behavior. Two static slices—eMBB and mMTC—are configured using distinct DNNs and dedicated UPF instances to enforce service-level isolation. Performance validation is conducted using iperf3-driven TCP and UDP traffic for the eMBB slice, achieving stable throughput over 50 Mbps in both uplink and downlink. The mMTC slice is simulated using synthetic telemetry-style traffic to reflect low-data-rate IoT scenarios. Prometheus and Grafana are integrated for end-to-end observability, enabling slice-specific metric collection and anomaly detection. Our modular, containerized design enables reproducibility and provides a foundation for future enhancements, including dynamic slicing and AI-driven RAN optimization."

    "abstract": "The interpretation of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery remains a challenge due to the complexity of extracting meaningful insights from large-scale geospatial data. In this work, we propose an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables interactive querying of a semantic knowledge graph-driven repository of annotated satellite images. We create a knowledge graph (KG) using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, which is used to enhance our satellite imagery with semantic context. This is achieved by linking extracted geometric features (polygons) from satellite imagery to their corresponding entities in the knowledge graph, enabling precise localization and visual annotation of queried features. This satellite imagery builds our repository, which allows users to retrieve both textual responses and annotated images based on natural language queries. Our system effectively enhances the usability, accessibility, and contextual understanding of low resolution satellite imagery by transforming raw geospatial data into structured and retrievable information. Experimental results on satellite imagery of Bangalore demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving and visualizing geographic information"

    "abstract": "In the modern world, traffic flow control has become an increasingly relevant task, as the growing number of vehicles leads to increased congestion and reduced road traffic efficiency. Traditional control methods, based on fixed rules and signals, often fail to cope with the dynamics of traffic flows. In recent years, neural networks have shown significant potential in solving such problems due to their ability to process large volumes of data and identify complex patterns [1]. This study aims to develop and apply neural network models to generate production rules for traffic flow control systems, to improve the efficiency and resilience of transport systems. The proposed methodology involves using a neural network model to predict key indicators, such as capacity, while considering various factors that influence transport network elements. The model is then used to form consistent rules for the inference system by analyzing the model’s weights and applying an algorithm to evaluate factor significance."

However, existing VG datasets primarily focus on standard object recognition or semantic segmentation, often neglecting the interplay between visual content and semantic context. To address this issue, we propose a new task, Visual Reasoning for Remote Sensing Images, which requires models not only to localize objects but also to infer complex scene relationships and semantic connections. To support this task, we introduce LuoJia-VG dataset containing 40,903 image-referring expression-scene knowledge triplets. This dataset incorporates abundant scene knowledge on object relationships, functions, and potential activities, facilitating a deeper understanding of spatial and contextual dependencies in complex remote sensing images. By extending visual grounding task to visual reasoning, LuoJiaVG enables models to tackle more complex reasoning tasks, ultimately enhancing the understanding of semantic contexts in remote sensing scenes and supporting a broader range of geospatial applications. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on this dataset and establish a benchmark to facilitate future research in this task."

Two architectures of BCD to 7-segment circuits are designed, one is single stage, and the other is dual stage circuits. Single stage circuit is implemented using static CMOS logic while the dual stage circuit is designed using AND OR logic arrays. BCD to 7-segment converter with four BCD inputs and seven output corresponding to segments a through g are implemented in Cadence Virtuoso simulation tool using gpdk090 with both the architectures. The propagation delay of all seven segments is determined for both the architectures. The output segments a through g for a single stage BCD to 7-segment converter circuit produced a propagation delay of 91.8 ps, 1036.4 ps, 80.69 ps, 95.86 ps, 1158.5 ps, 72.5 ps, and 83.3 ps, respectively. Similarly, the output segments a through g for dual stage BCD to 7-segment converter circuit produced a propagation delay of 92.93 ps, 399.5 ps, 80.68 ps, 102.6 ps, 266.5 ps, 90.83 ps, and 101.1 ps, respectively. Depending on the type of architecture it is found that the output segments a, d, f, and g of single stage converter circuit performed faster with lesser propagation delay as compared to its dual stage version. On the other hand, the output segments b, c, and e of the dual stage have the least propagation delay compared to its corresponding single stage circuit. Our results show the application of respective architectures for high-speed applications in digital VLSI displays and other circuits."

This study compares the two most commonly used materials in overhead transmission lines (OHTLs), glass and polymer insulators, in terms of energy losses due to LC. Sensors installed on OHTLs were used to monitor LC and weather parameters in real-time at two stations, both located near highway roads, which are exposed to similar environmental conditions. Each insulator string consisted of one insulator per string at the first station and seven insulators per string at the second station. Energy losses were evaluated across all three phases for both materials. The results demonstrate that polymer insulators exhibit significantly lower energy losses compared to glass insulators under similar environmental conditions. On average, polymer insulators reduced energy loss by approximately 81 % compared to glass insulators. Additionally, the form factor calculated was higher for polymer insulators <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(26.04)$</tex> compared to glass insulators <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(4.78)$</tex>, indicating better insulation.

Conventional techniques like transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in the past for image classification, however, they frequently demand high computational costs and have trouble accurately simulating spatiotemporal dependencies. Using the EuroSAT dataset we present EEMamba a novel framework created especially for satellite image classification using State Space Models (SSMs). These problems are resolved by EEMambas integration of SSMs which enable effective latent pattern extraction in multispectral data while preserving a lightweight architecture. This method improves classification accuracy while also lessening the computational load. A significant benefit of our framework is its capacity to maximize feature extraction by utilizing multispectral bands guaranteeing robustness against noise and resolution fluctuations. To measure EEMambas computational efficiency we perform a thorough analysis of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) and performance enhancements. Large Earth observation datasets are among the real-time geospatial analysis applications that our framework can handle. We prove how EEMamba is a shining example of how state-space dynamics can revolutionize the analysis of geospatial images thus paving the way for future research that employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to address the evolving challenges in remote sensing image classification."

They help identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate alternative solutions in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. To ensure high accuracy, these models must integrate vehicle dynamics, road network characteristics, schedules, and the complex aspects of passenger behavior. Modeling passenger behavior presents unique challenges and requires a careful balance between simulation detail and model complexity. A critical component of this process is modeling passenger boarding and alighting, which directly influences system performance. Factors such as boarding speed, collision avoidance, crowd density, and station-specific features significantly affect dwell times at stops and the overall system efficiency. These variables are essential for generating precise estimates of travel times, operational costs, and service reliability. This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to modeling passenger boarding, incorporating realistic assumptions and behavioral patterns to enhance simulation accuracy. The proposed model is validated using simulations of Žilina’s public transport system, demonstrating its capability to capture complex interactions and deliver actionable insights. The model was also compared to existing estimates of group boarding times. By integrating these detailed modeling techniques, this study supports more informed decisions in urban transportation planning and enhances passenger satisfaction."

These T/R modules are commanded through multiple LRUs arranged in multiple levels of hierarchy. The interconnection between these LRUs across all the levels of hierarchy starting from source till destination is quite complex because of the sheer high numbers and many other factors like closed the operating environment, narrow space available for routing, small volume for installation etc. Thus designing, routing and managing thousands of such cables becomes quite a daunting task. This paper presents the challenges in the designing of the control cables optimized for minimum cable diameter and bending radius through iterative designs thereby enabling efficient routing of the cables through narrow ducts. At the same time, it is ensured that stringent performance criterion is met from each of these control cable. Because the operating environment is closed, it is also mandated to comply to Low Smoke Zero Halogen emissions from each cable in case of fire, which in turn is a contradictory requirement for achieving minimum cable diameter. This paper presents the various optimization techniques and best practices involved in the design and realization of different types of control cables. The cables are successfully realized, tested, performance evaluated and finally deployed in the array."

In order to avoid the influence of the indifferentiable problem, soft threshold formula is used to compute the formula containing L1 norm. Experiments show that the Split Bregman algorithm and ADMM algorithm can solve the $\\mathbf{P}$-Laplace Cheeger cut model, and the proposed P-Laplace Cheeger cut model can correctly cluster the datasets containing non-spherical clusters. Meanwhile, it has better results than the most important graph clustering algorithm on the real data sets."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of deepfake videos, forged multimedia, tampered contents across social media and other communication platforms poses significant challenges to digital security and information authenticity, necessitating effective detection mechanisms, particularly on mobile platforms. Deepfake videos increasingly undermine digital trust, but most detection methods depend on resource-heavy cloud systems, unsuitable for real-time use on edge devices. We present TemporalFormer, an enhanced EfficientFormerV2 model, optimized for fast and accurate deepfake detection directly on mobile and edge platforms. TemporalFormer analyzes video streams by extracting 30 equidistant frames from a 6 -second window by capturing a frame from live screen at 200 ms intervals and processing a batch of 30 frames in single prediction. This enables real-time processing of dynamic content like video calls, social media feeds, and video conferences. This lightweight framework integrates EfficientFormerV2’s feature extraction with positional encoding and a 1D CNN layer to model temporal dependencies, achieving an inference time of 20 ms per batch. Trained and tested on Celeb-df(v2), TemporalFormer attains an accuracy of $93.2 \\%$ and an AUC of 0.90, while demonstrating robust generalization with an AUC of 0.87 on the FaceForensics++ dataset during crosscorpora analysis, surpassing baselines such as Xception and EfficientNet-B0 in both performance and efficiency. By offering a scalable, offline solution, TemporalFormer enables robust, ondevice video forensics for resource-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "High-frequency (HF) communication is known as a pivotal task in military operations, disaster relief efforts and global broadcasting by virtue of its unique advantages of long-distance reach, non-relay capabilities and flexible deployment. Accurate forecasting of foF2 values is critical for optimizing HF communication technologies. However, the complex, nonlinear and dynamic nature of ionospheric variations caused by solar activity and atmospheric conditions makes it a huge challenge. International reference ionosphere relies on semi-empirical formulas with substantial prediction errors, while some data-driven variants focus mainly on time series predictions derived from individual stations, thus ignoring the inter-station correlations that are closely related to the model accuracy and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (STG-foF2) to address the above issues of ionospheric forecasting in the context of HF communication, which leverages a cascade structure of graph convolutional layers and long short-term memory layers to extract the intricate patterns and connections across diverse geographical locations and temporal intervals. Extensive experiments on Global ionospheric radio observatory datasets verify the superior performance in terms of accuracy and time complexity of the proposed STG-foF2 over the existing benchmarks under different geomagnetic activity states."

    "abstract": "Integrating domain knowledge into machine learning models enhances both predictive accuracy and theoretical consistency, particularly for problems governed by differential equations. While traditional machine learning (ML) techniques provide flexible data-driven approximations, they often disregard underlying physical constraints, leading to reduced generalizability. Embedding governing equations within learning frameworks has shown promise in scientific computing but remains underexplored in financial modelling. This work formulates a Physics-Informed Least Squares Support Vector Machine (PI-LS-SVM), incorporating differential equation constraints within the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) framework to improve function approximation under physical constraints. To validate its effectiveness, PI-LS-SVM is applied to solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (BS PDE), a fundamental model in option pricing. The method is trained using real-world data and benchmarked against standard SVM and LS-SVM models. Empirical results demonstrate that PI-LS-SVM achieves higher accuracy, reduced pricing errors, and improved robustness against market fluctuations, outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. The integration of physicsbased constraints enhances model stability and interpretability, reinforcing the broader applicability of physics-informed learning in constrained optimization problems. By bridging computational intelligence with structured modelling, this study highlights PI-LS-SVM as a generalizable framework for solving physicsinformed machine learning problems, with applications extending beyond finance into AI-driven modelling and engineering systems."

It focuses on addressing uncertainties inherent in clinical cardiac monitoring by systematically reviewing modern signal processing techniques, neural network architectures, and diagnostic support systems, and evaluating their effectiveness in arrhythmia detection and classification. Through a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning approaches versus deep learning architectures, the research identifies critical limitations in existing systems, including architectural complexity, interpretability constraints, and uncertainty management. Our analysis reveals that while current deep learning models achieve classification accuracies ranging from 83-98%, they often sacrifice computational efficiency and clinical interpretability. We propose a framework for evaluating ECG processing systems that balances accuracy, computational complexity, and clinical applicability. The findings show that one-dimensional convolutional neural networks offer the best trade-offs between performance (91-93% accuracy) and practical deployment constraints, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare and the availability of expert cardiologists are limited. This comprehensive review offers essential insights into developing next-generation cardiac diagnostic systems that effectively manage uncertainty while supporting clinical relevance."

In this study, in addition to using chromaticity components that are difficult for humans to recognize the superimposed data signal, we aim to improve the communication quality by using discrete cosine transformation (DCT) to superimpose the data signal in the low-frequency region, which is less susceptible to signal loss even when captured from a long distance."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of consumer electronics, especially through immersive embedded cyber-physical systems, has intensified the complexity of access control in decentralized environments such as the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). In critical applications like crowdsourced drone services for bushfire management, ensuring secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable data sharing among multiple stakeholders remains a major challenge. Existing blockchain-based or traditional access control methods often impose significant communication overhead, scalability bottlenecks, and privacy risks due to centralized or publicly auditable structures. This paper introduces a novel access management architecture that leverages Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which, unlike blockchain approaches, enable decentralized, fine-grained, and revocable authorizations without exposing sensitive information or incurring heavy computational costs. By integrating a cloud-based VC wallet, our system abstracts credential handling away from client applications, thereby enhancing interoperability and enabling seamless, standards-compliant collaboration among diverse drone operators and bushfire management authorities. The result is a framework that not only ensures robust data integrity and privacy but also delivers agile, efficient management of access rights, directly addressing the unique security and usability demands of immersive IoDT environments."

Current approaches to this challenge often rely on rigid control schemes or task-specific automations that do not adapt well to dynamic environments or varied operator needs. This article presents a novel large language model (LLM)-aided bimanual teleoperation assistant (BTLA) that helps operators control dual-arm robots through an intuitive voice command interface and variable autonomy. The BTLA system enables a hybrid control paradigm by combining natural language interaction for an assistive robot arm with direct teleoperation of the dominant robotic arm. Our system implements six core manipulation skills with varying autonomy, ranging from direct mirroring to autonomous object manipulation. The BTLA leverages the LLM to interpret natural language commands and select an appropriate assistance mode based on task requirements and operator preferences. Experimental validation on bimanual object manipulation tasks demonstrates that the BTLA system yields a 240.8% increase in success rate over solo teleoperation and a 69.9% increase over dyadic teleoperation, while significantly reducing operator mental workload. In addition, we validate our approach on a physical dual-arm UR3e robot system, achieving a 90% success rate on challenging soft bottle handling and box transportation tasks."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing images pose significant challenges for object detection due to their high resolution, complex backgrounds, large scale variations, and dense distribution of small targets. To address these issues, we propose an improved remote sensing object detection model based on YOLOv8, named Adaptive Frequency Global-Local Feature Fusion Model on YOLO (AFGLFF-YOLO). This model is optimized in two aspects: frequency domain feature preservation and cross-scale information construction. Firstly, an Adaptive Frequency Wavelet Downsample (AFWD) module is designed to effectively retain structural high-frequency details during the downsample phase. Secondly, in the feature extraction phase, a dual-channel structure combining frequency-response Wavelet-Guided Vision GNN-CNN (WGVGC) is introduced. Its fundamental module is the Vision GNN-CNN (VGC), where graph convolution and depthwise separable convolution collaboratively enhance the complementarity of global and local features. Furthermore, to mitigate the interference between high- and low-frequency features within the same feature space, a frequency guidance mechanism derived from wavelet decomposition is introduced. This mechanism employs the Daubechies4 (DB4) wavelet and Haar wavelet for feature frequency differentiation. Subsequently, the Global Low-Frequency Enhancement Fusion Module (GLFM) and Edge-Aware High-Frequency Enhancement Fusion Module (EHFM) are designed to achieve complementary enhancement of cross-frequency domain features through adaptive frequency fusion. Finally, experimental results on four public remote sensing object detection datasets, NWPU VHR-10, RSOD, DIOR and RS-STOD, demonstrate that AFGLFF-YOLO achieves mAP@50 of 95.6%, 97.6%, 79.6% and 83.1%, respectively, marking a significant improvement over the original YOLOv8 model. These experimental results validate the detection accuracy, feature representation capability, and robustness of the proposed method in complex remote sensing scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of global-local fusion and frequency domain feature enhancement."

However, existing strategies often suffer from inefficient energy allocation and poor dynamic response. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL)-based EMS to optimize the efficiency of HESS. Firstly, key road features are extracted from vehicle operation data using a sliding window, and then principal component analysis and an optimized K-nearest neighbors’ algorithm are used for feature dimensionality reduction and clustering, which can enable more precise feature classification under various road conditions. Secondly, a dueling double deep fuzzy Q-network (D3FQN) framework is proposed for real-time power allocation optimization. By combining the uncertainty handling capability of the fuzzy inference system with the efficient learning ability of the dueling architecture, the real-time adaptively decision-making ability of HESS can be enhanced under complex road conditions. Additionally, an adaptive reward function is designed to dynamically adjust the allocation strategy according to real-time road conditions, power demand, and battery status. Finally, the physical and comparative experiments are conducted, and the results validated the strong dynamic adaptability and efficient energy allocation of the proposed strategy across various road conditions."

This paper proposes supervisory multi switching data driven control strategy from both theoretical analysis and practical application. Specifically, multi switching control strategy and data driven control are combined together to achieve the dual goals, i.e. multi models selection and multi controllers selection, while determining the appropriate model and active controller through two optimization criterions. Firstly, the detailed academic theories center around data driven identification, multidimensional Taylor network structure, data driven switching controller for model tracking or mismatch and guaranteed optimal analysis, corresponding to switching models selection, switching controllers selection and optimal switching logic respectively. Secondly, the theoretical results are supported by automatic takeoff and landing of unmanned helicopter, as the entire automatic takeoff and landing are separated into five continuous subprocess. To better understanding the control principle for automatic takeoff and landing process, three different subjects are analyzed in constraint analysis, automatic takeoff control and landing control, leading to devise each controller for each subprocess by supervisory multi switching control, and constructing one supervisor mechanism to achieve the switching logic. Finally, one practical platform is shown to prove our theoretical analysis. Generally, roughly speaking, our paper introduces data driven idea into switching control to form an innovative multi switching data driven control, i.e, switching model identification and switching tracking control, while covering identification, control, optimization and application etc."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the AIGC wave reshaping the creative design landscape, color design is rapidly transitioning from intuition-driven to data-intelligence. However, a critical \"semantic gap\" persists between abstract human intentions and controllable parameters of generative tools. To address this challenge, this study proposes and neurocognitively validates a computational framework for semantic color design, grounded in the Chinese linguistic context. The framework integrates two core modules: 1) Semantic Deconstruction, which constructs a multidimensional color-semantic lexicon from Chinese multisource texts using natural language processing and 2) Parametric Mapping, which establishes a controllable model to map structured semantics to quantitative color parameters in the perceptually uniform CIELAB space. Critically, we employed event-related potentials to validate the framework’s semantic accuracy in this cultural context. Neuroscientific evidence has confirmed that colors generated by our framework elicit cognitive responses consistent with target semantics; the N400 effect was statistically equivalent to that of a highly congruent baseline (equivalence test, p < 0.01). The study further revealed a hierarchical contribution of color attributes to semantic conveyance: hue played a decisive role, followed by brightness, whereas the influence of saturation was limited. The proposed framework not only offers a scientific paradigm for bridging the semantic gap in color design but also provides a computational blueprint for next-generation AIGC tools, enabling them to move beyond randomness toward precise, controllable, and semantically meaningful color generation."

This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied logic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today’s powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Next, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We also discuss the emerging \"Post-2025\" landscape, where rapid saturation of reasoning benchmarks by models like Gemini 3 Pro necessitates a shift toward \"living\" adversarial evaluations. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is critical for global carbon cycle research and climate policies such as REDD+, but single remote sensing sources face limitations: optical sensors suffer from saturation and cloud interference, SAR has saturation and terrain-induced distortions, and lidar (e.g., GEDI) provides high-precision vertical structures but sparse coverage. Multi-source data fusion - including data-level, feature-level, decision-level fusion, and spatio-temporal scaling - leverages the complementary strengths of optical, SAR, and LiDAR data to mitigate these issues, machine learning (e.g., RF, XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., CNN, Transformer) to improve performance, and hybrid models to balance learning ability and robustness. Key challenges including data heterogeneity, geometric/radiometric inconsistencies, saturation in dense forests, cloud-induced optical data loss, and sparse GEDI footprints are addressed through validation frameworks (involving forest maps, NFI, airborne LiDAR) and uncertainty quantification methods (e.g., spatial cross-validation, Monte Carlo simulations). Regional case studies (Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia) show optimal strategies for specific environments, while future directions focus on collaborative GEDI with P-band SAR, dynamic monitoring through temporal fusion, physical based deep learning, federated/transfer learning, interpretable AI, and standardized REDD+ protocols. Based on a systematic review of AGB estimation studies in tropical forests in the past five years, this paper summarizes the development progress of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and advanced algorithms, identifies the existing technical bottlenecks, and proposes a future-oriented comprehensive optimization framework to improve the accuracy and robustness of AGB estimation."

    "abstract": "Hybrid beamforming (HBF) offers a cost effective solution for multiple-input multiple-output dual-functional radar-communication (MIMO-DFRC) systems by reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. While narrowband HBF has been widely studied, wideband HBF design, particularly for transceiver-side hybrid architectures, remains rather underexplored. Existing HBF methods for wideband MIMO-DFRC systems typically adopt a sequential optimization (SO) framework based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM), assuming a fully digital receiver architecture during the initial optimization stage. This assumption restricts the design flexibility and limits the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) on the communication side. To this end, an integrated constrained manifold optimization (ICMO) framework is proposed. The ICMO method embeds the transmit and receive HBF matrices, subject to constant modulus (CM) and transmit power per subcarrier, into an integrated variable and projects them onto an ICM-space for joint optimization. This transforms the original constrained problem into an unconstrained manifold optimization problem. Subsequently, a parallel simplified quasi-Newton (PSQN) method is developed to optimize the integrated variable within the ICMO framework, ultimately yielding the transmit and receive HBF coding matrices. Simulation results under a Pareto behavior analysis show that the proposed method dominates the CADMM baseline across the SSME and SE frontier, achieving up to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$40\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> higher SE at comparable SSME and about 4.4 dB lower sidelobe levels, thereby enabling spectrum efficient and low sidelobe DFRC design."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images (HRRSIs) is essential for various geospatial applications. While recent transformer-based models demonstrate promising global modeling capabilities, they are susceptible to attention noise—particularly in cluttered or noisy scenes—leading to degraded segmentation quality. This challenge is amplified in HRRSIs, where spatially heterogeneous noise and ambiguous object boundaries are prevalent. To address this problem, we propose PDDFormer, a Position-aware Differential Denoising Transformer tailored for semantic segmentation of HRRSIs. Central to our design is the Spatially Gated Differential Attention (SGDA), which adaptively modulates denoising strength across spatial positions using a learnable gate. Unlike prior differential attention models, SGDA introduces position-aware denoising that dynamically adjusts attention suppression at each token, guided by spatial semantics. This allows PDDFormer to suppress redundant background responses while preserving critical structural semantics. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, ISPRS Potsdam and LoveDA, demonstrate that PDDFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and boundary preservation. Moreover, PDDFormer achieves favorable performance-efficiency trade-offs, making it practical for large-scale geospatial analysis. Visualizations further confirm the model’s ability to generate cleaner, more coherent segmentation maps, validating the effectiveness of our spatially adaptive denoising strategy."

    "abstract": "Island nations are particularly vulnerable to dynamic coastal changes influenced by both natural and human factors and, specifically, coastline; the intersection between land and water, and its changes over a time period reflect the evolutionary information about the resources and ecosystem of the coastal region [1]. To acquire essential information on the intensity of changes, extracting coastline, particularly for the island countries, is crucial. Remotely sensed satellite imagery is considered an important data source for continuously monitoring the coastal area and its alterations. It has opened an effective way to conduct research work as it provides frequent data with a large coverage [2]. Consequently, the detection and extraction processes of coastlines from different medium and high-resolution satellite images have been developed [3]. Therefore, automatic extraction techniques, including edge detection, band thresholding [4], and classification approach [5], have been applied in satellite images to acquire coastline information within a short period of time. However, to extract the coastline of a small atoll island, using a specific coastline extraction method becomes challenging due to the complex and distinct coastal features. Therefore, an automatic method combining segmentation and thresholding is proposed to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to delineate the coastline from the satellite image. Funafuti Atoll, an archipelago of small, scattered islets with unique features, was selected as the study region for extracting the coastline and analyzing the recent coastal alterations. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and sea level information were utilized to extract coastline and analyze coastal alterations. At first, resampling was performed to convert the required bands into the same resolution (10 m). Then, NDVI was calculated in the resampled images because it enhances the contrast between the land and water, which is regarded as a crucial part of the coastline extraction process. Afterwards, superpixel segmentation method was applied to segment the image into smaller area, and then, segmented areas of target islet regions were linked to NDVI values. To account for the unique features of each islet, adaptive thresholding was utilized to differentiate between land and water accurately, enabling the extraction of coastlines from 2019 to 2023. Subsequently, sea level data corresponding to the image acquisition periods was incorporated to adjust the DEM for each year. This adjustment involves adding or subtracting sea level values to reflect temporal variations accurately. The adjusted DEMs and extracted coastlines were then overlaid to identify spatial shifts, highlighting areas of erosion or accretion. To quantify these changes, the land area lost or gained was analyzed, and the elevation differences between adjusted DEMs were used to estimate the volume of material displaced. The estimated volume was calculated by multiplying elevation changes by pixel area, providing insights into the scale of erosion or accretion over time. The study depicts that the length of the coastline decreased by approximately 0.27 %, and the vegetation area decreased by approximately 3.52 %. Most of the alterations happened in the eastern part of Funafuti, which were caused by human intervention and tropical cyclones."

In this study, we present DichroGAN, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed for this purpose. DichroGAN employs a two-steps simultaneous training: first, two generators utilise a hyperspectral image cube to estimate diffuse and specular reflections, thereby obtaining atmospheric scene radiance. Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation. DichroGAN is trained on a compact dataset derived from PRISMA satellite imagery, comprising RGB images paired with their corresponding spectral bands and masks. Extensive experiments on both satellite and underwater datasets demonstrate that DichroGAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art underwater restoration techniques."

It focuses on determining accurate travel time from a specific origin point to a destination point. Given the development of new technologies such as GPS and mobile applications, this data can be easily gathered, improving the estimation of the O-D travel time and enabling prediction in almost real-time. Currently, one of the simplest and newest algorithms is the $KNN - \\bar WH$ model, an improvement of the K-Nearest Neighbors method with Haversine distance and a correction factor. Unfortunately, the direct application of this method can take over 50 minutes to predict a new set of 70,000 data points. This paper proposes $k - KNN - \\bar WH$, a new two-step framework that clusters the data using k-means and then applies $KNN - \\bar WH$ on the corresponding cluster. The empirical results show a minimal impact on the MAPE performance (1.5%) while reducing the time estimation process from approximately 50 to 20 minutes."

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of proximity relationships between individuals and groups in urban spaces is critical for public safety alerts, emergency evacuation planning, commercial flow analysis, and urban planning optimization. Existing indoor localization techniques-including TOA/TDOA/AoA geometry-based methods, visual SLAM, inertial navigation (PDR), and RSSI/UWB fingerprinting-achieve high accuracy in static environments but rely heavily on large-scale manual labeling, strict clock synchronization, or dense anchor deployment, and struggle to accommodate both trajectory continuity and dynamic environmental changes. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-modal deep learning framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Multidimensional Scaling embedding. First, channel feature similarities are computed from CIR sequences sampled continuously by mobile terminals, and an attentionenhanced proximity graph is constructed. Then, the graph adjacency matrix is fed into the MDS algorithm to recover the relative low-dimensional layout of observation points, enabling robust reconstruction of crowd density and flow topology. To mitigate class imbalance and manage positive and negative pair ratios both within and across trajectories, we introduce a spatiotemporal pair generation strategy and employ a weighted binary crossentropy loss during training. Simulation results demonstrate that under sparse sampling and dynamic conditions, our method significantly outperforms traditional thresholding and existing unsupervised baselines in both precision and recall, and approaches the performance of supervised methods under moderate label noise. This framework offers an efficient, annotation-free solution for indoor crowd density estimation and flow analysis."

In this work, we introduce a browser-based platform that merges a U-Net deep learning network with Augmented Reality (AR) to deliver live wound segmentation and infection risk indication through a standard camera feed. The system was trained on a diverse set of wound images covering different categories such as diabetic ulcers, surgical incisions, and burns, and included variations in skin tones and lighting to ensure wider applicability. Experimental evaluation shows that the U-Net achieved high accuracy (Dice = 0.91, IoU = 0.87, sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.93), exceeding the performance of conventional CNN models by about 12%. The AR module overlays wound contours and potential risk regions directly on the real-time stream, offering clear and immediate visual cues to both patients and medical staff. This solution provides a step toward earlier infection detection, improved remote monitoring, and reduced clinical workload, while also being accessible without specialized equipment."

A modeling frame-work is described for benchmarking these methods against classical baselines and for integrating quantum simulation into existing toolchains.Results indicate promising acceleration for search/optimization and certain perception and estimation subroutines, while end-to-end gains depend critically on state preparation, oracle construction, error rates, and measurement overhead. Given current hardware and SWaP constraints, immediate onboard deployment is unrealistic; instead, we propose a staged path: near-term offboard/cloud assistance for pre- and post-processing, medium-term hybrid classical–quantum pipelines, and longer-term integration of compact quantum coprocessors as devices mature. The paper concludes with practical guidance on workload selection and evaluation criteria for robots."

On the other-hand AI4Bharat shows highly efficient Multilingual translation benchmarks. However, in prompt engineering, using LLM alone as a translator often leads to hallucinated outputs lacking context, defaulting to the most common meaning of words and producing extremely bookish language. Fine-tuning the LLM models to support all the languages is costly. This work explores the challenges in machine translation of native languages when using prompt engineering as well as the transformative role of an LLM with the AI4Bharat transformer as a sophisticated language interface, enabling seamless communication across Indic languages with remarkable translation quality. In this study, the performance of AI4Bharat transformers is evaluated using Samsung consumer electronics offers dataset. The proposed translation pipeline integrates IndicTrans2 and Mistral models to benchmark the translation accuracy. By selecting evaluation metrics that focus on translation quality and contextual accuracy, the limitations are addressed. Leveraging RAG Framework with Mistral and IndicTrans2, the approach enhances translation performance for sector-specific offers, demonstrating the effectiveness of specialized LLM prompts and transformers in improving multilingual translations.

    "abstract": "Infertility presents a pressing clinical and societal challenge, yet its study is constrained by the scarcity of representative data. Public health datasets such as NHANES contain rich physiological, behavioural, and demographic features but are limited by severe class imbalance, with infertile cases representing only a small minority. This imbalance reduces the sensitivity and generalizability of machine learning models applied to infertility prediction. Traditional rebalancing strategies, such as oversampling, are insufficient for capturing the complex hormonal, psychosocial, and environmental interactions underlying infertility. This paper reviews advances in synthetic data generation as a means to address these limitations. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer statistical realism and coverage, while large language models (LLMs) introduce the possibility of embedding domain knowledge and clinical constraints directly into synthetic case creation. These approaches promise to enrich minority-class representation, enhance predictive robustness, and improve fairness in reproductive health modelling. At the same time, they raise new challenges of validation, transparency, and ethical oversight. By synthesizing insights across existing methods, this review highlights infertility as a critical test case for generative $\\mathbf{A I}$ and argues that progress depends not only on technical innovation but also on developing trustworthy frameworks for clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "The evolution of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has reached a stage of maturity where the social acceptance of these systems is becoming as important as coping with technical challenges. Most users complain that ADAS functions behave unnaturally, and they feel anxious because the driving system behaves in a way that is far from what the user prefers. One of the most controversial ADAS functions is Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA). This system detects the edge of the lane and drives the car actively by intervening on the steering wheel. Most available lane keeping follows the center of the lane, while the vehicle controller oscillates and often deviates from this line. Most people find this operation disturbing and unreliable. In our work, we propose a comprehensive Model Predictive Planner and Control that preserves the basic concept of how human drivers drive: they instinctively create the combined representation of the environment and the vehicle, and predictevely plan their action trajectory (i.e., steering angle). This method does not divide the driving task into planning and control, thereby improving tunability. On the other hand, the method provides direct relation to vehicle dynamics and high-level policies, and therefore it can be validated easier than end-to-end trained functions, such as neural networks. The initial algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and validated via simulation.

The measurement system, comprising calibrated sensors and data acquisition units, enabled real-time monitoring of structural response under test loads. Procedures for signal processing, data analysis and extraction of key dynamic parameters are described, alongside the criteria applied for interpreting the experimental results. To complement the experimental analysis, a finite element model of the bridge was developed, providing a numerical framework for validation and correlation of the measured dynamic behavior. The integrated approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the bridge's structural performance and ensures reliability in operational conditions."

In this work, we present RS-DiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer for generating remote sensing images conditioned on text discriptions. The main idea of RS-DIT is to predict the noise to be removed through conditional information in the input noise image, and generate remote sensing images that meet specific needs through diffusion. We use the semantic differences between remote sensing images of different categories and the text description information of a single image as conditional input, so that the generated images can achieve good results in semantic generalization and accurate description. In order to evaluate the difference between our model and previous GAN and transformer-based methods, we used zero-shot classification, FID, Inception, and clip score to evaluate the authenticity, diversity, and semantic relevance of the generated images. Experimental results demontrate that our method achieves SOTA performance."

Furthermore, it has been a major focus of research in cryptography over the past few decades. The proposed technique for implementing Universal Verifiability in the e-voting system for this research is the Block Ballot method. The Block Ballot method is effective for handling voting requests in electronic voting environments. The system treats every voter’s choice as an exchange that gets aggregated into a poll box, allowing the tally of votes to be monitored through the Block Ballot structure. Anyone can agree on the final count thanks to the Block Ballot’s audit trail, which allows the total number of votes to be confirmed by verifying that no data was altered, removed, or improperly introduced into the block. Based on several simulations, the block ballot method has been successfully used for the purposes of universal verifiability at the e-voting stage. The block ballot method in this study produced a universal verifiability degree of 1, which shows that the block ballot has reached the best universal verifiability degree value compared to other methods."

Among such methods, coverage control has promising applications in tasks such as surveillance, exploration, and environmental sensing. However, in coverage control using CSMA/CA, degraded control quality due to communication collisions is a problem. To address this issue, information transfer methods, where each agent transfers the received position information to its neighbors, have been proposed. In previous studies, evaluations assumed agents moved using a uniform linear motion model. In environments where position observation is noisy, the convergence tends to degrade. This paper introduces a PID control model for agent motion in coverage control with information transfer. We compare its control quality to that of the uniform linear motion model, and clarify the influence of PID gains on control quality."

This can be useful in simulations in hazard situations, earthquake simulations or architecture, archaeology, engineering and defense contexts. However, modeling this type of complex structure requires a significant amount of time and manual work, especially when it comes to designing and planning the interior according to important parameters, such as room size and ratio. This paper presents a method for procedurally generating interior floor plans, based on buildings extracted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This approach subdivides a building into rooms and corridors, parametrized by room area and room ratio, based only on its geometry. This method is designed to adapt to imperfect data with an unspecified orientation. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a user study with 29 participants. The results show that this approach is particularly strong in how it handles imperfect information and manages space and is stronger at generating smaller rooms. This method provides a fast and effective way to generate building interiors, independently of their orientation or the existence of imperfect data, with a focus on the study of shock wave propagation through them."

Traditional authentication which includes use of passwords, central databases, and third party recovery present great security and also usability issues. Zero- Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and blockchain have put forth as very good for Decentralized identity systems. But also many present solutions have large compute requirements, don’t scale well, and have poor user recovery. This review puts forth that in present ZKP based identity systems we see the lack of password less login, human readable identities, and self sovereign recovery. We look at recent systems which we note have a heavy use of complex crypto credentials, central verification which is a point of failure, and extensive infrastructure which in turn do not see wide scale adoption. To present solutions to these issues we have put forth a UID based identity which uses ZKPs for authentication which does not require storage of passwords or private keys. We introduce a novel recovery which uses a human readable phrase from private key, salt, and UID which in turn is a user controlled method. What we did is we put the UID on the blockchain which in turn improves privacy and scale. Our analysis which we present improves on issues of usability, scale and security which in turn we present a very simple and practical solution for today’s identity management issues. Also this study we present which we put forth to be the base for what we think will be future works in the development of useable ZKP based identity systems."

    "abstract": "The challenges of making semiconductor technologies work reliably, in terms of yield, fault-tolerance, have escalated dramatically, due to the rapid scale-down into the nanoscale regime, and these challenges are even more acute in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) systems. Traditional Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tools, well known as the backbone of digital verification, are increasingly not keeping up with the stochastic and dynamic fault model of the advanced nodes. The techniques tend to overedit to a priori fault models, like stuck-at or transition fault models, and thus are not very flexible to newer defect patterns. Furthermore, their over-reliance on exhaustive backtracking and deterministic search, inject too much computational overhead and redundant test vectors that weaken efficiency while managing silicon lifecycle (SLM). Enter recent cutting-edge developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) the prospect of probabilistic models learning complicated patterns of defect incidence, and the apparent need to revisit traditional to the world understanding of diffusional phenomena. Of these, diffusion models are notable in the variety and high quality of the samples of data they are able to produce by iteratively removing noise using generative annealing, rendering them useful at preserving distributional diversity yet alleviating mode collapse, one of the more faults of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we develop a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) framework that is automatic test pattern synthesis oriented in nanoscale VLSI systems. Wide-scale data consisting of defect and failure trace data (combined with benchmark circuit data) is used to train fault-aware representations that generalize beyond classical fault models. Incorporating such an approach into an SLM pipeline can enable a model to be adaptively retrained using incremental defect data such that the ultimate relevance is maintained throughout the device life cycle. Experimental results on the ITC-99 benchmark circuits show a 22 percent enhancement in fault coverage over the traditional ATPG and GAN-based synthesis and a 40 percent decrease in run time, and, further, it produces statistically diverse test vectors with no addition of test vectors. The scalability of the approach to medium-to-large circuits is further demonstrated by a detailed case study and demonstrates a greater diversity of fault activation in a circuit with increased robustness. These findings indicate that there would be a paradigm shift of the application of electronic tests strategy and diffusion-driven synthesis stands tall as a viable and dynamic solution to and management of reliable microelectronic devices."

However, usually planar SL HEMTs suffer from limited access region channel utilization, as only one two-dimensional electron/hole gas (2DEG/2DHG) channel in the access region contributes when fabricated. In this work, we propose a planar \"SL U-GaN HEMT,\" where sidewall GaN layers connect the superlattice two-dimensional electron/hole gases, enabling all access-region channels to conduct. Two-dimensional technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations confirm normally-off behavior with a threshold voltage of approximately 4 V for the n-type SL U-GaN HEMT. The n-type SL U-GaN HEMT delivers over 3 times higher drain current than the regular SL GaN HEMT, while the p-type variant shows significantly reduced gate leakage. These results demonstrate that the planar SL U-GaN architecture addresses the channel utilization limitation of planar SL GaN HEMTs and provides a path for planar GaN CMOS integration."

    "abstract": "Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by maintaining a balance between previously learned and newly introduced knowledge. Existing methods, primarily based on regularization techniques like knowledge distillation, help preserve old knowledge but often face challenges in effectively integrating new knowledge, resulting in limited overall improvement. Endpoints Weight Fusion (EWF) method, while simple, effectively addresses some of these limitations by dynamically fusing the model weights from previous steps with those from the current step, using a fusion parameter alpha determined by the relative number of previously known classes and newly introduced classes. However, the simplicity of the alpha calculation may limit its ability to fully capture the complexities of different task scenarios, potentially leading to suboptimal fusion outcomes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach called Adaptive Weight Fusion (AWF), which introduces an alternating training strategy for the fusion parameter, allowing for more flexible and adaptive weight integration. AWF achieves superior performance by better balancing the retention of old knowledge with the learning of new classes, significantly improving results on benchmark CISS tasks compared to the original EWF."

    "abstract": "The intrinsic characteristics of music affect the brain by activating specific areas that alter its electrical activity. Understanding this behavior can support relevant applications, but high dimensionality hinders model interpretability, performance, and generalization. Therefore, selecting the most informative channels would reduce complexity, lower computational cost, and potentially improve classification performance. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the musical genre associated with an acoustic stimulus based on the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, aiming to overcome the high dimensionality of the data. To this end, we computed the functional connectivity (graph G) between EEG channels using techniques from various analysis domains, and mined the most representative channels (nodes i). To achieve dimensionality optimization, we propose two centrality measures based on the h-index and degree-strength centrality (DSC) metrics: (1) global ks-index (h<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf>), and (2) local l<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf> -index (l<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ks</inf>).

The selected networks and channels were then mined: the former using global topological measures, and the latter using conventional time-series metrics. In the experiments, we varied the number of the most relevant networks and channels, as well as the DSC type, and used five classifiers with repeated k-fold cross-validation. Our best classification accuracy was 60.1%, achieved with one graph, two channels, and an artificial neural network. The results showed that the new indices helped distinguish subtle structural variations between nodes, select the most relevant channels, and surpass the state of the art in the accuracy-channel ratio."

While Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are the standard solution, their performance heavily relies on internal strategies like cache eviction, where conventional algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU) are often suboptimal for dynamic user access patterns. Furthermore, much of the advanced research in CDN optimization is validated solely through simulations, creating a gap between theory and reproducible practical implementations. This paper presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive, multi-regional CDN testbed to bridge this gap. The testbed integrates three main subsystems: a server subsystem using Nginx, a monitoring subsystem with Prometheus and Grafana, and a machine learning subsystem for intelligent cache eviction. As a primary validation of its utility, we used the testbed to conduct a comparative analysis of cache eviction policies. Results show that under a realistic Zipf distribution traffic simulation, the machine learning-based Learning from the Experts (LRB) algorithm achieved an average Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) of 90.15%, significantly outperforming the baseline LRU (85.84%). The main contribution of this work is a functional, measurable, and reproducible testbed that not only validates the superiority of an intelligent caching approach but also provides a platform for future CDN optimization research."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of improving the noise immunity of LoRa wireless technology in conditions of intense interference. To this end, an analysis was conducted of the influence of modulation parameters—bandwidth (BW) and spread factor (SF)—on communication quality indicators, in particular bit error rate (BER) and data transfer rate. It is shown that, with a fixed SF, an increase in bandwidth has virtually no effect on BER, but leads to an increase in transmission speed. By adapting SF together with BW, the required speed can be achieved while maintaining low BER values. The results obtained allow us to formulate recommendations for selecting modulation parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in conditions of deteriorated electromagnetic environment."

    "abstract": "The paper presents an intelligent platform for scientific research in the field of computer vision, aimed at comprehensive comparative analysis of the accuracy, performance, and robustness of modern models under variable lighting and weather conditions. The primary objective of the development is to create a scalable system that supports experiments with a wide range of models (YOLOv8– YOLOv11, DETR, Mask R-CNN, SSD, RetinaNet, etc.) using interactive analytics, complete logging, and automated report generation. Unlike conventional testing environments, the proposed platform accounts for the characteristics of images from various application domains. For each scenario, log files are automatically stored with key metrics (mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:.95, Precision, Recall, F1-score, IoU) and FPS, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of both accuracy and processing speed. A distinctive practical novelty of the system is the implemented module for studying the impact of video stream preprocessing methods (CLAHE, gamma correction, median filtering, etc.) on object detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated, for example, that in low-visibility conditions the combination of Zero-Dce + gamma correction + CLAHE yielded an increase in mAP@0.5 in the range of 4–6%, depending on the model architecture. The platform also provides tools for assessing the effect of CUDA acceleration on the performance of each model. The developed system has undergone validation in a series of experiments, including tasks of adapting computer vision models within hardware-software complexes for assisting visually impaired individuals under limited computational resources, confirming its efficiency and practical applicability in various applied domains"

The main purpose of this model design is to capture both spatial and temporal features in the ECG signals simultaneously. Experimental results show that our model achieved outstanding performance on the MIT - BIH arrhythmia dataset (2017 competition version): it exhibited a significantly higher macro F1 score of 0.914 and a specificity of 0.987, which surpasses the 0.82 macro F1 score of traditional CNN LSTM concatenated hybrid models. Notably, the introduction of the GGCA mechanism significantly enhanced the feature discrimination ability, giving our model the potential for application in real - time cardiac monitoring scenarios."

    "abstract": "Cement accounts for approximately 8% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, and traditional cement production is a major culprit of this. Sustainable alternatives are imperative to lessen the environmental impact of the construction industry so urgently. The invention described herein proposes an innovative enzymatic carbon sequestering bio-cement that utilizes microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) to develop a low-carbon and self-healing cement substitution. Rather than allowing the aggregates to disperse or settle out of suspension, a bioanalytical approach is used, which takes advantage of urease-producing bacteria like Sporosarcina pasteurii for capturing atmospheric CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> through biochemical reactions that precipitate CaCO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf> while binding aggregates as well. This process is different from conventional cement, requiring ambient temperature, which reduces energy consumption and lowers emissions. The experimental results show that bio-cements possess similar compressive strength, long service life, and the ability to self-heal micro-cracks, thereby increasing the life span of the infrastructure and reducing maintenance costs. Furthermore, the life cycle assessment shows a huge decrease in the carbon footprint of Portland cement. This means that enzymatic bio cement has the potential to change green construction by providing a scalable, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly replacement for conventional cement. We would identify ways in the future to improve bacterial performance, large-scale implementation, and integration with current multi-part construction practices to rapidly accelerate the adoption of bio cement in public and private implementations."

    "abstract": "Chiplet is the technological and structural architecture of an emerging computer system. It is an architecture that integrates heterogeneous components such as SoC, SiP, multichip, package, silicon die, and CPU. These structural components form the logical architectures: Chiplet GPU, Chiplet Memory, Chiplet I/O, Chiplet Interconnects. For the market, chip-let has a clear advantage over Monolithic Chips, which is determined by the following properties: Improved Yield, Flexibility, Scalability, and Heterogeneous Integration. As part of emerging computing, a Chiplet is just logic, represented by structures and functions, and nothing else. Chiplet Interconnects are no exception – this is also logic. A systematic approach to modeling, simulation, and testing the logic of Chiplet Interconnects, the model of which is represented by a logical vector, is proposed. The basic paradigm is that any logic should be tested systematically against logical faults that are in the good-value model of the structure or functionality, either explicitly or implicitly. Any physical defects in components or bus Interconnects in the Chiplet architecture manifest as logic faults. Defects violate the logic of any computing device, including bus structures. This means that any physical defects manifest themselves as logical faults. This means generating system tests that cover combinations of logic faults. A Modelling test card is offered, which is a logical relationship between a comprehensive test and all combinations of logic faults. A logic vector is all you need to model a Chiplet Interconnects test map in three matrix operations. As well as any structure and functionality, it can be represented by a logical vector for modeling a test map. In addition, a logical vector is also a data structure for graph rendering of the validity of a process or phenomenon model. A logical vector is the simplest model that is convenient for simulating on a computer and rendering the results for a human. Modeling and rendering on the logical vector harmoniously complement each other in solving market problems. Examples and processing time of bus, graph structures, and functionalities for modeling a test map and graph rendering models are given. All mechanisms for modeling and rendering test maps for functions and structures are embedded in the Python language codes, which are exposed in cyberspace as an open-source application."

This technique uses InSAR histograms that are obtained by mapping each pixel in a SAR interferogram to a particular height bin according to its corresponding interferometric phase. This approach potentially enables the estimation of forest vertical structure, from which surface topography and tree height can be retrieved. In this work, the vertical profiles obtained using the Histomography technique are compared with the LiDAR waveforms to assess strengths and limitations of the method. The SAR dataset is a stack of fully-polarimetric L-band UAVSAR images acquired over the Howland Forest, USA, in summer 2021, while LVIS LiDAR waveforms are considered the reference data. The comparison between the SAR profiles and the LiDAR measurements indicates that Histomography effectively captures the vertical structure of the forest."

    "abstract": "This work analyzes the prospects for modernizing the MTZ-82 tractor by replacing its traditional diesel transmission with an electric drive system. A critical review of the shortcomings of the classic mechanical transmission is presented, highlighting significant energy losses (up to 18-23%), high operational costs, and poor ergonomics. The transition to an electric drive is proposed as a solution. The paper provides a comparative analysis of various electric drive concepts, including direct engine replacement and wheel-hub motors, and justifies the choice of the most balanced scheme — the use of individual axle-specific electric motors with compact gearboxes. Based on detailed calculations of the parameters of the existing MTZ-82 transmission (wheel torque, rotational speed), technical specifications for designing the electric drive system have been developed. Key requirements are defined: a peak motor torque of 300 N•m, a rated power of 120 kW per axle, a gearbox ratio of 140:1, and a high protection class of IP67. The technical and economic analysis demonstrates that the proposed modernization can increase the overall efficiency of the power plant by 25-30% and reduce operational costs by 40-45% due to lower maintenance and fuel expenses. The service life of the system's key components should be at least 20,000 hours for the electric motors. The developed approach preserves the tractor's operational characteristics while significantly improving its energy efficiency and environmental friendliness."

    "abstract": "Text backdoor attacks bring great risks to the secure deployment of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, where attackers usually inject a specific trigger to mislead the model. Various of backdoor triggers have been designed, including visible triggers, e.g., directly adding a specific symbols to the end of the sentence, and invisible triggers, e.g., rewriting sentence structure or style. Generally, the invisible triggers are hard to be peceived by both human readers and backdoor defenders, but they also meet two limitations, i.e., the low training efficiency and low attack success rate. To address these challenges, we propose Unstable Sample based Style Enhancement (USSE) for invisible text backdoor attacks. Specifically, we improve training efficiency by prioritizing unstable samples that are more prone to distributional shifts during training iterations, thereby reducing redundant updates and accelerating model convergence. Furthermore, we enhance attack success rates by introducing a style enhancement score that reinforces the consistency and distinctiveness of trigger-specific stylistic features, making them more easily activated during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets-SST2, OLID, Ling-Spam, and HSOL-demonstrate that USSE improves training efficiency by more than $30 \\%$ compared with random selection methods, while also achieving a $2 \\%$ increase in attack success rate."

Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and exposed to human error due to the large amount of data recorded during tests. This paper proposes a fully automated solution for data processing and evaluation of qualification tests in hydropower units. The user interaction with the software system is mediated by a minimalist and intuitive interface, designed also in Phyton, to logically guide the operator through the analysis configuration steps. The user can define the precise context of the evaluation by selecting essential parameters. The choice of the test type, whether it is a certification procedure designed to validate compliance with standards or a qualification procedure for assessing operational performance, establishes the regulatory framework and purpose of the analysis. Subsequently, the precise specification of the hydropower unit under test ensures full traceability of the results, and the selection of the particular test to be processed, such as the dynamic response to frequency variations or the behavior during operation. The proposed solution reduces manual intervention, accelerates reporting, and improves result accuracy."

Considering the direction control application of dipole electromagnets within particle accelerators, we will primarily be concerned with determining the rotation transformation that is applied by the dipole's field onto the electron beam's direction vector. In order to achieve this, our work involves fundamental concepts of particle physics and electromagnetism, together with a set of magnetic field measurements performed on the device under test. Our beam deflection computations will involve the assumption that the magnetic field generated by the device is directed along a single dimension of our coordinate system. This assumption is only valid if the dipole electromagnet is correctly positioned in the electron beam's path. In an attempt at solving this issue, our testing setup is used to correctly determine the adjustments that may be performed on the dipole's positioning, relative to its intended mechanical configuration, such that the previously mentioned condition holds. This method has the potential of allowing for the usage of electromagnets that are moderately outside specifications, as long as the field generated by them may be considered uniform in a given aperture. In other words, our work may be used to correct orientation errors in dipole electromagnet manufacturing, without increased costs."

Details of the phase estimation algorithm are presented. Besides, architecture and adaptive algorithm of the AAAs weights calculation are presented as well. The algorithm is based on the Linearly Constrained Recursive Least Squares approach. It uses the Matrix Inversion Lemma to invert the AAA input signal correlation matrix, which is used for the calculation of the Kalman gain vector which in turn is used for the calculation of the AAA weights. Simulation results demonstrate 0.5°…4° phase estimation accuracy, if the 3-by-3 AAAs are used, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio is –20 dB at the outputs of the AAA channel receivers and the AAAs operate in the presence of 0…8 spatially distributed interfering signals with the Interference-to-Signal Ratio of 90 dB each.

    "abstract": "The frequency of an electric network is its most important parameter. High accuracy of frequency measurement in real electric networks allows for high accuracy of measurement of other electric parameters, which include the root-mean-square value, active power, reactive power, apparent power and a number of electric power quality parameters. One of the most promising measurement methods is the method based on obtaining the signal spectrum and then finding the frequency corresponding to its maximum. The main source of methodical error in this approach is associated with the socalled “spectrum leakage” effect. To eliminate this effect, weighting functions are often used, the effectiveness of which is limited. In this article, a comparative analysis of the applied weighting functions is performed and their effectiveness is estimated. The cases of a rectangular window, a Hanning window and a window with maximum suppression in side lobes are considered for cases of spectrum approximation using three samples. The effectiveness of the approaches is estimated for the case of a sinusoidal signal, a sinusoidal signal distorted by noise and a polyharmonic input signal. Using the Matlab software package, a simulation model was obtained, which allowed us to check the correctness of the obtained analytical expressions and evaluate the effectiveness of the approaches under consideration."

Well logs, as structured tabular data, provide rich features for Vs prediction. However, traditional machine learning models struggle to capture the complex coupling among multi-source logs, while deep learning models often require heavy preprocessing and large parameter scales. This study proposes a Vs prediction method based on MambaTab, which embeds well log features and employs a structured state-space model (SSM) to capture long-range dependencies along depth and nonlinear relationships among features. Experiments on carbonate and volcanic rock datasets show that MambaTab outperforms benchmark models, effectively balancing accuracy and efficiency. This method offers a promising framework for geophysical characterization and reservoir prediction in complex geological settings."

The study examines informatics education across multiple levels of the educational system, ranging from primary and secondary education to higher education. Particular emphasis is placed on higher education, especially within teacher preparation programs in computer science, focusing on how prospective educators can effectively integrate modern technologies and tools into their instructional activities, develop students’ digital competencies, and support their ability to solve complex problems. AI is taught as a standalone subject at the master’s level of teacher education in computer science; however, it also serves as a supportive tool that enhances students’ problem-solving skills. Rather than providing ready-made solutions, AI guides students, explains reasoning, and facilitates the development of their own knowledge structures. The paper explores practical applications of AI tools in teaching practice, such as lesson planning and accessing up-to-date information relevant to course content. Within the context of computer science didactics, the authors provide examples of classroom activities involving chatbots and discuss how AI can be effectively utilized by both students and educators in self-directed learning. The paper concludes with a summary of general opportunities and challenges associated with the use of AI in education, supported by the authors’ experiences and recommendations for its effective implementation."

As full-wave EM simulation is infeasible for such large-scale MMIMO arrays, the proposed IDM-approach offers an useful time and memoryefficient route for NF analysis, with better accuracy compared to conventional isotropic element based technique. The normalized Poynting vector magnitude and EM Lagrangian density in the NF region are visualized for large-scale ID-based URAs. It is shown that the spatial distribution of normalized EM Lagrangian density plots provide an alternative paradigm as compared to the traditional phase-error criteria to quantify the “Fresnel distance” (boundary between the reactive and radiating NF region) for large-scale MMIMO arrays. The impact of the array-aperture dimension in configuring the distribution of NF reactive energy density is further highlighted through the large-scale ID-URA examples."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, however, real-world deployments are often constrained by Periodic Deterministic Communication (PDC) schedules, where communication between clients and the central server occurs at fixed intervals due to bandwidth limitations, energy constraints, or regulatory restrictions. These rigid schedules introduce fundamental challenges, including delayed model updates, model drift, inefficient convergence, and heightened sensitivity to non-IID data distributions, which undermine FL performance in practical settings. To address these limitations, we propose Federated Nested Quasi-Newton Optimization (FedNQN), a novel framework that accelerates convergence and enhances FL robustness under PDC constraints. FedNQN integrates curvature-aware central acceleration with variance-controlled local adaptation, ensuring stable learning dynamics despite restricted communication. At the global level, second-order curvature information accelerates model updates, compensating for infrequent synchronization, while local updates leverage variance-controlled optimizations to mitigate drift and adapt to heterogeneous data distributions. This coordinated optimization strategy enhances convergence speed, improves model accuracy, and maintains computational efficiency, making FL more adaptable to real-world constraints. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate FedNQN’s effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of stability, scalability, and resilience to communication inefficiencies."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In recent years, the quantification of structural uncertainty using evidence theory has been widely adopted. However, there is a long-term difficult problem of overconservative reliability in this field. This article reveals that the “one-vote veto” phenomenon in the mapping mechanism of the focal element's basic probability assignment (BPA) to the reliable domain is the fundamental reason. Thus, the rational mapping of focal element's BPA to the reliable domain is a new problem that has not yet been paid attention to and is in urgent need of a solution. To address this new scientific problem, a “cut-merge” approach for uncertainty quantification inspired by triangular distribution is proposed. Its core idea is “cutting” first and then “merging.” “Cutting” is to construct two extreme probability density functions (PDFs) that obey the triangular distribution on each focal element, and “merging” is to integrate the extreme joint PDF on the reliable domain, to realize the scientific mapping of focal element's BPA. This method eliminates the need for extreme value analysis of focal elements and requires only the computation of two definite integrals to obtain the reliability interval. The results of an artificial synthetic case with a known true distribution of focal elements show that the proposed method is obviously superior to the traditional method in most engineering scenarios. The results of four application examples show that compared with the traditional method, the proposed method reduces the uncertainty interval width by 64.81% on average and increases the smoothness index by 67.01% on average. This work provides a new theoretical tool for structural reliability analysis."

    "abstract": "Radiance field techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in reconstructing photorealistic real-world scenes. However, a widely recognized limitation of these methods is their reliance on densely captured images for training. Active learning offers a promising solution by selecting the most informative images to capture. An effective measure of data informativeness is the mutual information between the unknown image and the model parameters, known as the expected information gain. Naive estimation of this quantity requires inferring both the model and predictive distributions, which is computationally intractable for high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we propose a computationally tractable method to estimate information gain. Instead of sampling in the high-dimensional model parameter space, we leverage the ray sampling process inherent in volume rendering to approximate the expected information gain. Specifically, we parameterize volume sampling with perturbed ray directions and learn the predictive distribution to infer optimal perturbation patterns. Furthermore, we derive an empirical risk decomposition that demonstrates how our method effectively explores the volume sampling space to enhance diversity, leading to efficient and informative view selection. Experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality for active learning of radiance fields, outperforming previous methods across various datasets, including both forward-facing and object-centric scenes."

    "abstract": "Sea fog is a frequently occurring and potentially hazardous meteorological phenomenon. To better capture its dynamic characteristics within complex marine environments, this study conducted six cruise observation experiments off the eastern coast of Huangdao Station in Shandong Province by using a millimeter-wave cloud radar operating at a frequency of 94GHz mounted on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). First, a comparative analysis was performed against the 35-GHz cloud radar installed at Huangdao Station to evaluate their capability in characterizing sea fog. The results showed that both radars were capable of detecting the vertical distribution of sea fog, while the 94GHz millimeter-wave radar exhibited higher sensitivity to capture weak fog particles during in the early stage of fog formation. Subsequently, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to investigate the relationships among key meteorological variables—forward visibility, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed—and radar echo intensity. The analysis revealed a significant interrelationship among these variables, with a path coefficient of 0.72 for their collective influence on radar echo intensity. Radar echo intensity exhibited a significant positive response to relative humidity and a significant negative response to forward visibility (p<0.001). In addition, forward visibility was retrived using both the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results demonstrated that XGBoost achieved substantially higher predictive accuracy, with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>>0.819.

    "abstract": "We propose and numerically investigate a CMOS-compatible hybrid plasmonic ridge waveguide (HPW)-based TM-pass polarizer that combines a silicon core with an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) slab separated by a silica spacer. The hybrid structure enables strong modal coupling and selective attenuation, allowing the TM mode to propagate efficiently while the TE mode is progressively suppressed through mode hybridization along the coupling region. Comprehensive 2D and 3D finite element analysis confirms the device’s high performance and compactness. With a total footprint of only 7 μm, two optimized models are presented: Model-1 emphasizing ultra-broadband operation, and Model-2 achieving an ultra-high polarization extinction ratio (PER). The broadband model (Model-1) demonstrates PER ≥ 20 dB across 349 nm (1469–1818 nm), PER ≥ 30 dB across 255 nm (1488–1743 nm), and PER ≥ 50 dB across 127 nm (1523–1650 nm), covering the entire C, L, and U telecom bands. The high-PER model (Model-2) attains a record PER of 74.72 dB with a low insertion loss (IL) of 1.36 dB at 1550 nm. The proposed compact and fabrication-friendly designs offer an excellent trade-off among bandwidth, extinction ratio, and loss, making them strong candidates for on-chip polarization management in silicon photonic integrated circuits and broadband optical interconnects."

    "abstract": "In this article, a fault-tolerant architecture (FTA) is presented for the multiuser detector in interleave division multiple access (IDMA). The detector is inherently prone to soft errors, as its chip area is predominantly occupied by memories, which are easily exposed to high-energy particles and hostile interferences in harsh environments. One of the most widespread ways to protect memories is to encode their entries with error-correcting codes (ECCs). However, naïvely encoding all bits in an entry is likely to be costly and unnecessary. Accordingly, to sort out performance-critical bits and determine the priority of protection, we extensively scrutinize how vulnerable respective bits in the memories of the detector are too soft errors. Based on the analysis, in addition, an efficient FTA that selectively encodes only a subset of the bits in order of the identified vulnerability is developed. Furthermore, the proposed FTA implements the state-of-the-art multiuser detection (MUD) scheme called on-the-fly despreading (OD) and showcases a new feature named purification, which repeatedly replaces erroneous entries with corrected ones to keep them error-free. Complicated memory accesses to concurrently perform the OD as well as the purification are enabled by remodeling both the datapath and the control path of the baseline OD architecture (ODA). Implementation results demonstrate that, unlike the prior arts that fail to sustain near-optimal performances and become impractical even for a very low probability of soft error, the proposed FTA may operate robustly in a wide range of harsh conditions without incurring much overhead."

    "abstract": "Direct AC/AC SST is a single-stage solid state transformer (SST) that exhibits high efficiency and power density compared to multi-stage SSTs. The voltage across the HFT terminals is prone to volt-sec unbalance which is undesirable and leads to several critical issues such as DC in HFT magnetizing current, HFT saturation, efficiency reduction and semiconductor switch damage lowering SST reliability. Identifying and analyzing the origin of volt-sec unbalance in direct AC/AC SST is essential for developing strategies for eliminating the same and ensuring reliable SST operation. This paper investigates the volt-sec unbalance problem in direct AC/AC SST and identifies its primary cause as false current commutation for one current polarity in the primary matrix converter. The origin of volt-sec unbalance in direct AC/AC SST, it's effect on SST operation and the hardware issues that lead to it are analyzed in detail with experimental observations. The paper proposes a method for predetermining the sampling instants of HFT primary current and defining the allowable switching regions for primary and secondary converters in a switching cycle to reduce volt-sec unbalance to zero. A set of circuit design guidelines to avoid volt-sec unbalance are also proposed. With the proposed method, the required sampling frequency of HFT primary current is only two times the SST switching frequency. The proposed method is verified on a laboratory prototype. Finally, the paper derives a maximum DC current limit for the HFT of direct AC/AC SST that depends on maximum input voltage, commutation step time, switching frequency and winding resistance."

    "abstract": "For port air-pollution monitoring, which is characterized by high mobility and strong temporal variability, automatic path planning is critical for enabling shipborne multi-UAV cooperation. This paper focuses on path optimization under the simultaneous motion of a “carrier ship–multi-UAV–multiple target vessels” system and develops a time-dependent cooperative planning model. With the objective of minimizing the total monitoring completion time, the model explicitly represents the full cycle of launch–rendezvous–sampling–recovery, incorporating dynamic rendezvous, sampling time windows, and battery-closure constraints, and replaces static Euclidean distances with a dynamic distance matrix. A deep learning–dynamic ant colony optimization fusion algorithm (DL-DACO) is proposed, in which a neural network adaptively tunes key ACO parameters, while the pheromone update rule integrates elite reinforcement, annealed heavy-tailed perturbations, and time-varying evaporation rates to enhance global search capability and reduce the risk of premature convergence. Simulation results show that, compared with a fixed-base monitoring strategy, the proposed dynamic mobile-base strategy reduces the total monitoring time by 17.87%. Furthermore, compared with existing algorithms, the proposed fusion algorithm shortens the total monitoring time by 3.36% and 4.25%, respectively, demonstrating that the developed model and algorithm can substantially improve the efficiency of UAV-based pollutant monitoring and the path-planning capability of shipborne multi-UAV cooperative environmental monitoring."

    "abstract": "Clipboard usage is prevalent in mobile applications nowadays. However, insufficient access control on the clipboard in mobile operating systems exposes its contained data to high risks where one application can read the data, store it locally, or even send it to remote servers. Unfortunately, the literature only has ad-hoc studies in this respect and lacks a comprehensive and systematic study of the entire mobile application ecosystem. Therefore, this paper proposes an automated tool, ClipboardScope+, that leverages the principled static program analysis to uncover the clipboard data usage in mobile applications at scale by defining a usage as a combination of two aspects, i.e., how the clipboard data is validated and where does it go. It defines four primary categories of clipboard data operation, namely spot-on, grand-slam, selective, and cherry-pick, based on the clipboard usage in an application. ClipboardScope+ is evaluated on over <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1.2 million</i> mobile applications available on Google Play, spanning the years 2022 and 2023. It uncovered an increase of 5.9% in behaviors of storing and transferring clipboard data over the one-year time, most of which occur automatically in background services. We also conducted a comprehensive case study to characterize different clipboard usages and reveal their privacy issues. Moreover, we uncovered a prevalent programming habit of using the <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SharedPreferences</monospace> object to store historical data, which can become an unnoticeable privacy leakage channel."

However, many high-field NI magnets have experienced quench induced mechanical degradation, including the outer joints connecting adjacent double pancake (DP) coils. This study investigates the mechanical stress that develops at these joints during a quench, using the 45.5 T Little Big Coil 3 (LBC3) as a reference. Azimuthal currents were reconstructed from the measured voltage data using an optimization method based on evolutionary strategy. These time-dependent current profiles were then used to compute Lorentz-force-induced stress in a 2D axisymmetric finite element analysis (FEA) model. Results show that inductive coupling during the quench leads to azimuthal current imbalance between adjacent pancake coils, causing bending and high compressive stress at the outer joints. The stress increases with current imbalance and propagates sequentially as the quench advances. A mitigation strategy was discussed by suppressing current imbalance using a magnetic dam."

    "abstract": "Power distribution networks (PDNs) are designed to deliver sufficient and stable power to printed circuit board (PCB) components. With increasing current/voltage demands on modern PCBs, power rails in PDN require more space for metals. Existing design techniques often adopt greedy heuristics to optimize the metal shapes of power rails. However, they consider little spatial competition among different power rails, so routing spaces may be distributed unevenly, causing redundant metal usage, current/voltage violations, and even routing failures in high-current designs. To remedy this problem, we propose a multi-layered PDN design flow to distribute rail spaces according to current/voltage demands appropriately. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the spatial competition issue in PCB power rail routing. Specifically, we generate a multi-layered topology and minimize the metal area and the via usage with mathematical programming. To resolve the overlap regions by rail detouring, we also propose a resistance-aware routing algorithm. Experimental results show that our work significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm extended from the state-of-the-art rail router in the metal area and runtime, achieving respective reductions of 55% and 71%, without any current/voltage violations."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing (RS) image change detection (CD) provides an extremely effective technical means for urban expansion analysis, land use assessment and other tasks. However, RSCD often faces the problem of uneven edges caused by ignoring structural continuity in pixel-level prediction, and pseudo-change interference caused by low-frequency color changes induced by light and shadow, which seriously affects detection accuracy and robustness. For this reason, we propose a structure sensitive and semantic alignment synergistic enhancement network (S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet) for RSCD. Centered on structure preservation and semantic enhancement as its core design philosophy, the framework aims to precisely identify authentic changes while effectively suppressing background artifacts. Specifically, a hierarchical adaptive frequency-spatial synergistic change focusing module (FSCF) is designed to analyze high-frequency sub-bands of shallow features in the frequency domain, thereby adaptively enhancing edge structures. A learnable denoising mechanism is introduced to suppress high-frequency noise to offset artifacts. The contrastive locking mechanism is fused in the spatial domain to further accurately define the real change area and improve the perception sensitivity and positioning accuracy of structural changes. In addition, a multilayer bidirectional progressive fusion module (MBPF) is proposed to establish a shallow to deep structure guidance and a deep to shallow semantic feedback path, facilitate bidirectional multi-scale information flow, and effectively achieve cross layer feature collaborative modeling and semantic consistent expression. Rigorous evaluations across four widely-recognized change detection datasets (SYSU-CD, CLCD, WHU Building Dataset, and LEVIR-CD) demonstrate that S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Relative to the sub-optimal network, S<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>ENet achieves IoU improvements of 1.43%, 2.02%, 0.32% and 0.37% on respective datasets.

Despite Med-LVLMs producing state-of-the-art performance, they exhibit a bias toward predicting findings as normal, leading to reports that overlook critical abnormalities. Furthermore, these models often fail to provide comprehensive descriptions of radiologically relevant regions necessary for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose Medical Report Generation Agents (MRGAgents), a novel multi-agent framework that fine-tunes specialized agents for different disease categories. By curating subsets of the IU X-ray and MIMICCXR datasets to train disease-specific agents, our MRGAgents generates reports that effectively balance normal and abnormal findings while ensuring a comprehensive description of clinically relevant regions. Our experiments demonstrate that MRGAgents outperformed the state-of-the-art counterparts, improving both report comprehensiveness and diagnostic utility."

In this paper, we present a federated learning framework that integrates cloud-native services specifically from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support secure, scalable, and interoperable training across client environments. This approach utilizes serverless components such as AWS Lambda, SageMaker, and Step Functions for orchestration, and we introduce a federated API standard designed to coordinate training across multiple cloud providers. This paper address key challenges such as client heterogeneity, non-IID data distributions, and cross-cloud synchronization. Initial architectural validation and experimental planning suggest that this framework can efficiently scale FL workloads without vendor lock-in. We anticipate that this federated API design can simplify multi-cloud collaborations and accelerate privacy-preserving AI development in critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and industrial IoT."

For this purpose, we have taken the dataset from Roboflow consisting of 3461 dragon fruit images. We extracted an unannotated dragon fruit image dataset from Roboflow platform and added annotations to it. Among the deep learning models on annotated images, ResNet50 obtained the highest accuracy of 97.30% while YOLOv5 achieved an accuracy of 95.40%. On the other hand on unannotated images VGG 16 obtained the highest accuracy of 91.10% leaving behind ResNet50 with the accuracy of 63.13%. Deep learning algorithms with image annotation and without image annotation into the field of farming experiment only done for dragon fruit images. In agriculture domain image annotation is used for various tasks like crop detection, crop health monitoring, and livestock management etc. Image annotation is the image labeling technique. This technique is more specific to recognize the different objects to machines using artificial Intelligence algorithms. Computer vision based AI systems are trained with annotated images which help the agriculture field be more productive and proficient in various tasks."

We present the first systematic study of how such defenses impact group fairness in DFL, evaluating six state-of-the-art methods across three vision datasets under varied attacks and graph topologies. Our results show all robust methods consistently degrade fairness relative to weighted averaging, even without attacks, with degradation worsening under sophisticated attacks like ALIE and DISSENSUS. However, not all defenses degrade fairness equally. We identify the root cause as a fundamental misalignment between outlier-detection mechanisms and fairness objectives, where defenses treat statistical deviation as adversarial, inadvertently penalizing minority client updates. These findings have critical implications for DFL deployment in fairness-sensitive domains, underscoring the need for fairness-aware Byzantine defenses that can distinguish between malicious and underrepresented statistical patterns."

Its core innovation lies in mapping fine-grained temporal behavioral patterns to difficulty levels, enabling the framework to distinguish students’ group cognitive states corresponding to teaching segments and map them to “easy”, “medium”, “difficult” levels. Results show the automatically annotated difficulty has a significant statistical correlation with students’ after-class questionnaires and expert evaluations (Spearman’s coefficient $\\mathbf{\\gt 0 . 7}$).

To address these issues, we propose VeriCoT, a framework that integrates majority voting with fine-grained verification of differences, thereby enhancing the robustness and precision of multimodal reasoning. By modeling multiple reasoning chains and systematically contrasting their outputs, VeriCoT mitigates errors arising from isolated predictions and improves overall reliability. Experiments on the ScienceQA and MathVista benchmarks show that VeriCoT consistently outperforms baseline models by reducing inference errors and increasing accuracy, particularly in tasks that require complex reasoning over textual and visual information. In particular, applying VeriCoT to the Gemini model raises its accuracy from 87% to 89.6% on MathVista and from 93.4% to 94.8% on ScienceQA. These results highlight the importance of diversity in reasoning processes and underscore verification as a critical step in advancing multimodal CoT methods."

    "abstract": "The Industry 5.0 revolution and the rapid spread of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the labor market present unprecedented organizational-, managerial-, and employee challenges. This study provides an integrative literature review of AI applications in workplace practices and employee attitudes, with particular focus on generational differences among Generation $X, Y$ and Z. For the time being, academic researchers have barely analyzed generational differences at work, in relation to AI, and when they have, the target group consists only of university students. Based on the results, it appears that research is still in its very early stages, and university students are currently the primary focus of academic research, presumably because they are easier to involve. There is already more generalist research, in which case the research sample population is general and does not analyze the extent to which the behavior of each generation is similar or different in relation to the factors examined. However, it is clear that Generation Z receives special attention, even though Generations Y and X are likely to face more challenges in terms of technological change and AI acceptance, as they have different psychometric and habitus characteristics than the members of Generation Z, who are “overpowered” and proficient in new technologies. Even though successful AI transformation from a managerial perspective is not only a technological but a human-strategic issue: mobilizing synergies between generations and creating an inclusive organizational culture is essential for ensuring long-term competitive advantage and better employee well-being. In sum, there is a significant market gap that has yet to be filled, so further research on this topic is warranted."

    "abstract": "Turnovers in ice hockey create a short-lived but highly critical window of vulnerability, where the probability of conceding a goal increases sharply within the first 10 seconds. This paper develops a rigorous mathematical optimization framework to determine how and when a team should apply a tactical strategy switch and/or lineup adjustment to minimize goal concession risk in this window. The proposed approach formalizes the game state as a hybrid system with discrete modes representing strategy-lineup pairs and continuous dynamics describing player motion and puck transitions. Switching decisions are constrained by substitution latencies, bench geometry, and coverage feasibility, and are evaluated through a multi-objective cost functional balancing hazard reduction, player effort, and switching penalties. Novel contributions include (1) a criticality index for early-warning detection of high-risk states, (2) latencyaware substitution models that capture transient substitution risks, and (3) receding-horizon optimization policies for operational deployment. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates how micro-substitutions and role-specific strategy shifts can reduce concession hazard without violating feasibility constraints. The results provide a mathematically grounded decision-support framework for coaches and analysts, bridging applied mathematics, informatics, and performance sports to improve defensive resilience in high-tempo, turnover-driven scenarios."

The first yield gap case study in Australia was published in 2012 and led to a range of crop-specific Australian yield gap assessments (see https://yieldgapaustralia.com.au) as well as assessments of yield gap of crop rotations. An important limitation of previous efforts in this space has been our reliance on sub-national level crop production statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to infer crop yields achieved by farmers. Industry experts commonly argue that these yield values are significantly lower than field-scale yields and hence contribute to overestimating the Yield Gap. Here we present a method to downscale regional wheat, barley and canola yields into <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.1 ~\\text{km}^{2}$</tex> pixels using long term NDVI and EVI signals, and our efforts to ensure these downscaled values are representative of field-scale yields and therefore useful in situations where field-scale yields are not available. Our work is the first to investigate these concerns around sub-national yield statistics and to provide a way to make them more useful for applications relying on real-world estimates of productivity such as Yield Gap assessment and diagnosing."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a fully unsupervised testtime adaptation (TTA) strategy for robust deployment of autonomous systems in land cover mapping, addressing the challenge of domain shifts without relying on labeled target data. The proposed approach leverages entropy minimization and feature modulation to enable models to autonomously adapt to unseen target domains, characterized by variations in environmental factors, sensor properties, or data distributions. By generating and refining pseudo-labels during inference, the system achieves self-correcting capabilities, enhancing its autonomy and reducing reliance on human intervention. This is particularly valuable in resource-scarce regions, where acquiring labeled data is costly and time-consuming, yet accurate land cover maps are crucial for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and urban planning. The method is validated using Sentinel-2 imagery, demonstrating an average accuracy improvement of 9.3 % across diverse regions in Algeria. This scalable solution not only improves model robustness but also addresses socio-economic needs by enabling large-scale, cost-effective land cover mapping in underresourced areas. From an Earth observation perspective, this work is novel as it extends TTA to complex remote sensing applications, offering a fully unsupervised framework that operates without source or target labels. By combining entropy minimization, pseudo-label refinement, and feature modulation, the approach sets a new standard for autonomous systems in remote sensing, ensuring consistent performance in dynamic environments and contributing to sustainable development goals."

The proposed system aims to enhance the monitoring and detection of fires, with a particular focus on wildfires. Due to the complex nature of wildfire detection and classification, RGB imaging can be challenging. In contrast, infrared (IR) imaging simplifies this process, as fire captured by an IR camera displays a distinct pattern. This allows for more effective monitoring, detection, processing, and authentication of the images. The system is comprised of four primary components: image capture, software/hardware interface, image processing engine, and alarm module. The hardware module was implemented using the Vivado HLS Design Suite and targeted to the ZYNQ XC7Z020 SoC platform. The design efficiently utilizes FPGA resources, consuming less than 12% of Slice LUTs, 2% of memory LUTs, 5% of Slice registers, 8% of DSP blocks, and 4% of block RAMs. Implementation results demonstrate the system's inherent flame detection capabilities, effectively distinguishing hot flames from the surrounding environment."

By integrating information from multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio, it enables a more comprehensive perception and recognition of emotions from multiple dimensions. To address the limitations of current multimodal feature selection methods in terms of accuracy and correlation modeling, this paper proposes a novel method called Multi $L_{0}$ Deep Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (Multi $L_{0}$-DTCCA), which combines sparse feature selection with nonlinear correlation learning for multimodal emotion recognition. Specifically, the method employs the $l_{0}$ norms to select features within each modality, effectively eliminating redundant information, and leverages Deep Tensor Canonical Correlation Analysis (DTCCA) to enhance the nonlinear correlations across modalities, thereby improving the quality of the fused representation. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi $L_{0}$-DTCCA significantly outperforms several mainstream correlation analysis-based methods in terms of classification accuracy and result stability, verifying its effectiveness in multimodal feature selection and emotion recognition tasks."

The model first employs deep learning methods to extract key events and their causal relationships from unstructured text data generated by students on platforms such as university BBS forums, social media groups and online games. This process constructs individual event-reasoning graphs that reflect the evolutionary paths of students' ideological dynamics. Subsequently, leveraging the structural features of the graph, a quantitative assessment algorithm for ideological states is designed to achieve precise identification of potential ideological issues. Finally, the paper introduces a guidance strategy generation framework based on graph path planning, aiming to provide educators with personalized and executable intervention strategies. Experimental results on a dedicated dataset show that, compared to several baseline models including powerful pre-trained language models, the PIGM-ERG model demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, recall, and F1-score for identifying ideological problems. Furthermore, case studies and expert evaluations have validated the model's interpretability and the reasonableness of the generated guidance strategies, proving the application potential of event-reasoning graphs in profoundly understanding and guiding student ideological dynamics."

Results show that COSMIC-2 exhibits strong agreement near the F2 peak, with discrepancies increasing below 100 km due to overestimations during daytime and underestimations at night. Seasonal analysis reveals improved agreement during winter, while summer shows significant discrepancies driven by heightened ionospheric activity. The findings highlight COSMIC-2's limitations in resolving lower-altitude electron density structures and emphasize the need for refined retrieval algorithms."

    "abstract": "Home healthcare service routing optimization has become a critical issue in modern healthcare systems as the demand for efficient and patient-centered care continues to grow. This problem involves designing optimal visitation routes for healthcare staff under multiple operational constraints, with the dual objectives of minimizing service costs and maximizing patient satisfaction. However, most existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches primarily address single-objective problems and often struggle to balance conflicting goals in multi-objective scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a Weight-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (WADRL) framework for multi-depot home healthcare routing optimization. The proposed approach integrates a Transformer-based pointer network with a weight-aware modulation mechanism, enabling adaptive policy learning under varying optimization preferences. Furthermore, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) procedure is incorporated to refine DRL-generated solutions, enhancing both the quality and diversity of the Pareto front. Experimental evaluations on extended benchmark datasets demonstrate that the WADRL framework significantly outperforms classical multi-objective optimization algorithms, including NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D, in terms of solution quality, convergence, and robustness, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in intelligent home healthcare scheduling systems."

Traditional approaches, including exact and heuristic methods, often struggle with large problem instances due to their high computational complexity. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have emerged as an effective metaheuristic for solving TSP, but their performance can be further enhanced using parallelization techniques. This paper presents a Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) framework for solving TSP by leveraging distributed and multi-threaded computing architectures. The proposed approach implements parallelism at different levels, including population distribution, fitness evaluation, and genetic operations, to accelerate convergence and improve solution quality. We analyse the impact of various parallelization strategies on performance metrics such as execution time, scalability, and solution accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PGA significantly outperforms traditional sequential GAs, achieving faster convergence and better route optimization. Additionally, we explore the tradeoffs between computational efficiency and solution optimality across different parallel execution models. The findings highlight the effectiveness of parallel genetic algorithms in tackling large-scale TSP instances and provide insights into designing efficient evolutionary algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems."

    "abstract": "Named Data Networking (NDN) is an innovative information-centric networking paradigm that transitions communication from host-to-host to content-centric interactions. Nonetheless, its stateful forwarding plane— especially the Pending Interest Table (PIT)—presents new security vulnerabilities, most prominently the Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). In an IFA, assailants overwhelm routers with unsolicited interest packets, depleting PIT resources and impairing the performance of legitimate traffic. This study investigates the real-world impacts of IFA through a practical testbed. We found a significant reduction in performance as a result of an IFA attack. We also found that the negative consequences for IFA are very localized: only the routers along the attack path saw steep increases in PIT entries, nInInterest, nOutInterest, nInData, and nOutData, and all other nodes were largely unaffected. This localized pressure—only to routers that forward or terminate malicious Interests— suggests that IFA does not create congestion across the entire network. These results support the use of mitigation actions that do not have to be applied network-wide. In other words, it is possible to target vulnerability points such as edge or core forwarding nodes without responding across the entire network topology. Ultimately, our work contributes to an understanding of the subtle implications of IFA on NDN performance and informs the design of effective, adaptive defenses."

    "abstract": "For urban infrastructure expansion, real-time, intelligent, and automated monitoring is needed for it to be able to ensure structural integrity and operational efficiency at the same time. This research envisages an inventive 5G friendly remote sensing technique that combines edgeAI, digital twins, and blockchain to empower and maintain that a kinetic infrastructure is being well attended to. The ultra-low latency 5G networks are used coupled with ultra high resolution sensor information to feed to an edge computing AI system for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in real time. The digital twin model forms a virtual twin of the infrastructure assets to simulate structural degradation with AI-driven simulations and to optimize the maintenance schedule. Blockchain technology is employed to ensure data security and integrity and to create a tamper-proof distributed ledger for sensor data. To make the monitoring more accurate, the proposed system combines multiple sensors, i.e., LiDAR, thermal imaging, IoT sensors, and drone surveillance. The framework is tailored for critical infrastructure such as bridges, highways, railways, power grids, and smart buildings and enhances maintenance efficiency, decreases operational cost, and decreases failure risk. This shows through experimental results that conventional monitoring systems are not capable of achieving improved anomaly detection accuracy, lesser latency, and enhanced data security, as is the case with this new system. Through this, the research helps in developing the resilient, AI-powered, and secure infrastructure management solutions for making intelligent urban ecosystems and leveraging 5G connectivity for real-time, predictive, and autonomous infrastructure monitoring."

    "abstract": "Modern long range radars involve design and realization of complex sub-systems like Active Array Antenna Unit (AAAU), Multi-Channel Receivers, Real Time Embedded Hardware and Array Signal Processors and Radar Computer. It is a real challenge to integrate all these radar sub-systems for successful operation of different modes of the radar. The diversity of the problems faced during system integration is huge; some of the typical problems include packet loss within a sub-system, packet loss between multiple sub-systems, reception of variable length garbage data leading to dwell discard, difficulty of simultaneous parallel links validation at input and output due to unequal packet lengths because of difference in Packetization logic involving multiple protocols, etc to name a few. This paper discusses the various integration challenges that were faced during integration of real time embedded hardware with the rest of the processing sub-systems and the mechanism adapted to address the same. This work also serves as a guideline for future radar designs how to avoid the pitfalls already encountered in the present case."

While deep learning-assisted diagnosis has gained considerable traction in common disease detection, current endoscopic technologies primarily focus on IM identification rather than severity grading. To address this gap, we propose CTAN (ConTransAttenNet), a novel CNN-Transformer architecture with dual-pathway attention enhancement for IM severity classification. This framework synergistically integrates CNN’s local feature extraction capabilities with Transformer’s global connectivity while establishing a multi-dimensional attention synergy mechanism. Evaluated using our proprietary dataset of curated IM pathology images, this approach maintains expert-level clinical relevance while providing AI-driven objectivity and reproducibility, thereby establishing a new technical framework for IM monitoring."

    "abstract": "Optimization and automation of facility layout problems (FLPs) is a critical step for developing layouts in many industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, where layouts have significant impact on the material handling costs (MHC) and overall operational efficiency. Industrial FLPs often involve complex shaped components, continuous design spaces, and multi-floor layouts, presenting challenges that are difficult to handle for traditional approaches. To address these challenges, this paper presents a mulit-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm for optimizing unequal area facility layout problems (UAFLPs) in 3D space. The approach is proposed both in a centralized training centralized execution (CTCE) and centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) setting. Three experiments with increasing complexity are executed to asses the performance of the MATD3 approach and to benchmark it with a single-agent TD3 approach. The results demonstrate that the MATD3 in a CTCE setting consistently performs better than in a CTDE setting and the single-agent TD3 across all experiments. It develops superior layouts regarding MHS and shows more stable learning compared to the other approaches, especially with increased problem complexity. These results highlight the potential of utilizing MADRL to develop facility layouts in real-world environments."

In the online mode, the system employs OpenAI’s GPT models for language understanding and Google’s speech APIs for speech processing. In offline mode, it integrates Whisper for speech-to-text (STT), Coqui for text-to-speech (TTS), and a locally hosted large language model (LLM) using Ollama, ensuring that all processing occurs locally to safeguard user data. To enhance knowledge retrieval in offline mode, Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented using locally stored document embeddings. A graphical user interface (GUI) provides clear visual feedback and allows users to switch modes effortlessly. The modular, dual-mode architecture offers a balance between usability, accessibility, and privacy, making it suitable for applications in education, research, and professional domains. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the system delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses with low latency while maintaining strong privacy guarantees."

Consequently, a specific phenomenon that may occur is the loss of capacity assuring prescribed torque followed by the improper operation of the entire system.

Conventional measurement using sound level meters is often inefficient for large-scale or longterm monitoring. To address this challenge, this study presents an automated motorcycle noise detection system that integrates Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification. The dataset consists of 598 audio samples: 537 secondary data from Kaggle and 61 primary field recordings from real motorcycles under idle and constant gas conditions. MFCC was applied to convert raw audio signals into representative spectral features, which were then processed by a CNN to learn noise patterns effectively. The best CNN configuration (RMSprop optimizer with Uniform kernel and 80:20 data ratio) achieved 91.19% accuracy, with an F1-score of 0.82 for the noisy class. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining MFCC and CNN for real-time noise monitoring, offering a practical tool to support policymakers and environmental stakeholders in regulating vehicle noise emissions."

    "abstract": "The minimum-cost maximum-flow problem is a fundamental challenge in network optimization, with applications spanning logistics, telecommunications, and resource allocation. Traditional models assume precise arc capacities—an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios where parameters are uncertain. This article addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach to solving the minimum-cost maximum-flow problem in which arc capacities are represented as intervals, thereby accounting for data uncertainty directly within the database layer.The proposed method is implemented at the level of the PostgreSQL DBMS, leveraging its extensibility through SQL and the procedural language PL/pgSQL. The solution models the network as a database table and formulates the interval-valued problem. By exploiting PostgreSQL’s advanced features, including user-defined functions, an algorithm was developed that computes the robust maximum flow and subsequently determines its minimum cost, providing a guaranteed solution for all capacity realizations within the specified intervals.The article demonstrates that complex combinatorial optimization under uncertainty can be efficiently integrated directly into a relational database management system. The in-database implementation eliminates the need for data transfer to external application programs, enhances scalability for large network graphs, and provides a practical, robust decision-making tool for data-driven applications. Experiments on artificially generated networks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method."

Extending training to five epochs led to a slight decline across most metrics, suggesting the onset of overfitting. At the label level, minority-class performance improved at four epochs but degraded at five, indicating a trade-off between overall effectiveness and fairness in representation.

Finally, a multimodal feature set is constructed through fusion, and Cross-Attention is leveraged to achieve multi-label classification, user engagement prediction, and security event identification across multiple task levels. The experiments use the SAV dataset released in 2024. Experimental analysis demonstrates that multimodal fusion significantly outperforms single-stream models in various classroom scenarios, with particularly significant improvements in robustness in experimental exploratory classrooms. In-depth ablation experiments, error case analysis, and teaching application testing demonstrate that the model achieves significant improvements in recognition accuracy and generalization, effectively assisting in teaching evaluation, process monitoring, and safety warnings.

    "abstract": "The growth of weeds in cotton fields leads to significant crop yield losses, with increased weed growth occurring in areas between cotton plants. To manage this, it is crucial to classify the weeds to identify their presence and deploy automated machinery for removal. While Deep Learning techniques have been widely used for classification tasks, they come with the drawbacks of high energy consumption and substantial memory usage. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks have gained attention in image processing because of their compatibility with low-power neuromorphic hardware. This paper evaluates the performance of a Spiking Neural Network using the Integrate and Fire Neuron model to classify weeds in cotton fields. To increase computational efficiency, bilinear interpolation is employed during data preprocessing. A Pytorch-based library, Sinabs is used to convert a Convolutional Neural Network to a Spiking Neural Network. Three classes of cotton weed images from a publicly available source are used, and the results are presented in terms of accuracy, training time and neuron spiking output for sample images. The loss value for the network is 1.78. The accuracy values obtained for 3 classes of weeds are $84.47 \\%$ for Convolutional Neural Network and $\\mathbf{8 3. 3 4 \\%}$ for converted Spiking Neural Network."

    "abstract": "Starting from a basic antenna designed to operate at 2.4 GHz, this paper investigates systematic optimization of its geometry to enhance performance. After exploring shape modifications aimed at increasing either bandwidth or the gain of a single element, the optimized structure is employed to form antenna arrays that maintain the same bandwidth while achieving higher gain. Various array configurations and element spacings are examined to assess their influence on radiation characteristics. The results indicate that reducing the interelement distance improves the overall gain of the array. Corner rounding (filleting) has negligible impact on the S-parameters or gain, whereas chamfering the corners shifts the resonance to a higher frequency and reduces radiation efficiency. Three different spacings were considered between the antennas and for each of them chamfering and fillet were varied. Overall, the study demonstrates that arraying elements effectively increases antenna gain, in our case from 1.14 dB for an antenna to 4.57 dB for four antennas in an array, but careful consideration of the array's physical dimensions is essential. The principal contribution is demonstrating that the interaction between patchcorner geometry and inter-element spacing can be exploited to optimize array performance."

    "abstract": "Split Federated Learning (SFL) is a distributed machine learning framework where the models are split and trained on the server and clients. However, data heterogeneity and partial client participation result in label distribution skew, which severely degrades learning performance. To address this issue, we propose SFL with Concatenated Activations and Logit Adjustments (SCALA), in which activations from client-side models are concatenated as the input of the server-side model to centrally adjust label distribution across different clients, and logit adjustments in the loss functions of both server-side and client-side models are performed to deal with the label distribution variation across different subsets of participating clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the concatenation of activations reduces the impact of data heterogeneity, while logit adjustments in loss functions enhance the recognition of low-frequency labels at the cost of sacrificing the recognition of high-frequency labels."

It minimizes deviations from a target vehicle configuration while enforcing bounds on the expected values of quadratic constraints including states and controls, and fulfilling balance equations constraints. The problem uses a recent Linear-Quadratic (LQ) framework with stochastic quadratic constraints. Validation via two case studies shows that the method, despite disruptions, maintains proximity to references and satisfies all constraints, outperforming a traditional LQ controller and a heuristic controller, both of which lack the stochastic constraints. Furthermore, offline verification checks the covariance matrices' asymptotic limits to guarantee bound compliance."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in satellite-based Earth observation (EO) systems have more detailed representation of target information in captured remote sensing images, while intelligent target recognition has become increasingly sophisticated and effective. However, in complex application scenarios such as target camouflage recognition, interference countermeasures, component-level feature extraction, and feature database construction, target recognition models face several challenges. These include coarse feature extraction, unclear decision-making rationales, weak adversarial robustness, and unreliable prediction results. These limitations pose a significant bottleneck to the stable transfer of intelligent models in noncooperative and non-open source environments. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Artificial intelligence (AI)-based target recognition represents a crucial component of intelligent remote sensing image explanation. In the field of target information perception for high-resolution spaceborne remote sensing images, there is an urgent demand for trustworthy intelligent recognition under complex adversarial conditions. In this article, we propose a new paradigm for trustworthy intelligent perception based on spaceborne detection. Specifically, we analyze the competitive mechanisms among decision-making factors within the feature space under adversarial conditions, enabling the extraction of target-invariant features and the integration of feature explainability with adversarial robustness. Finally, our approach aims to enhance the adaptability and reliability of the target perception models.</p> <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This article first introduces our motivation, highlighting the reasons behind the uncertainty of current spaceborne intelligent perception capabilities under noncooperative conditions, which form the foundation for exploring trustworthy perception. Next, the article explains the three key components of trustworthy intelligence: feature invariance, feature explainability, and feature robustness. Then, based on cooperative game theory, we propose a trustworthy perception method that integrates these three elements, suggesting several feasible technical approaches along with reasonable analysis and expected results. Finally, the article concludes by summarizing the work and emphasizing the necessity and practical significance of spaceborne trustworthy intelligent perception.</p>"

    "abstract": "As corporate social responsibility (CSR) gains prominence, firms confront a strategic choice between symbolic CSR, which offers superficial signals and entails greenwashing risk, and substantive CSR, which eliminates this risk through genuine and impactful practices at a higher cost. Prior research primarily examined whether firms engage in CSR, with limited exploration on the choice between symbolic and substantive CSR once engagement is decided. This paper develops a game-theoretic model to examine firms' incentives for substantive CSR, and how these varies with market structures and relevant exogenous parameters, including price premium, greenwashing risk, and consumer boycotts. We find that firms implement substantive CSR only when the incremental marginal cost is sufficiently low, and this condition becomes more stringent under competition. Although competition discourages the adoption of substantive CSR, it increases consumer surplus and social welfare when substantive CSR is implemented. Counterintuitively, our paper demonstrates that price premium and consumer boycotts do not always promote substantive CSR under competition due to strategic price interactions. Furthermore, we derive the equilibrium CSR strategy structure and identify a dynamic set of the equilibrium structures that always includes the symmetric structures. Interestingly, a prisoner's dilemma, in which both firms implement Pareto-insufficient symbolic CSR, may arise when the set consists solely of the symmetric structures. Finally, we show that these results remain robust under model extensions and demonstrate that the presence of consumers who refuse to pay a price premium may surprisingly increase firms' prices and profits."

In this paper, we address the question of how to modify, during execution, the desired behavior while maintaining guarantees on the behavior, if possible; we define three types of modification: changing the maximum number of robots in a region of the workspace, changing the connectivity of the workspace, and redistributing robots. During execution, if the specification is modified, we update the controller by creating local patches. Given the starting and ending state of the patch, we jointly use a symbolic synthesis tool and a constraint programming solver to synthesize robot control. We demonstrate our approach in simulation."

    "abstract": "Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community."

Subsequently, a data-driven version of bias-Lyapunov iteration is developed to learn an optimal control for Markovian jump linear systems with completely unknown dynamics. Simulation examples validate the efficacy and advantage of the proposed bias-Lyapunov iteration method."

The control design is the key for improving the tracking accuracy of parallel robots. The PID controller, includes proportional, integral and derivative terms for tuning the controller. However, optimal tuning process of PID controller is cumbersome unless optimization techniques are proposed. In this study, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Fuzzy logic controller are proposed to tune the parameters of controller. The objective of these methods is to optimally tune the parameters of PID controller towards global minimum of tracking errors. Using the Root Mean Square of Error (RMSE) as the metric of evaluation, the numerical results showed that the Fuzzy PID controller with WOA optimized parameters by 77.3% on the xaxis and 66.7% on the z-axis as compared to the other implemented methods."

    "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and visionlanguage models (VLMs) is revolutionizing robotic-assisted surgeries by enhancing decision-making and operational precision. Despite these advances, the robustness of VLMs against adversarial attacks, particularly in surgical scene understanding via Visual Question Answering (VQA), is not well understood. These models are integral to surgical accuracy but may be vulnerable to data perturbations that can compromise patient outcomes. This paper introduces RoboSurg, a framework designed to protect VLMs against such adversarial threats in surgical environments. We tailor adversarial attacks to the surgical domain, exposing significant vulnerabilities in widely used models such as SurgicalGPT, BLIP, BLIP-2, and CLIP-ViL. RoboSurg incorporates multimodal adversarial training, advanced input preprocessing, and targeted architectural modifications to enhance the strength of these models. Our experimental results demonstrate that RoboSurg effectively lowers the impact of adversarial threats while maintaining model performance under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, the first study of adversarial attacks on VLMs in a surgical context is presented in this paper, and bringing AI solutions to the forefront of safety and reliability marks a significant achievement."

    "abstract": "In the field of personalized footwear and orthopedic sole manufacturing, acquiring accurate lower limb measurements is essential. While numerous image-based techniques—such as OpenCV with a reference object—have been explored for capturing foot dimensions, these methods often suffer from limitations including occlusion, perspective distortion, and missing or inaccurate parameters. To address these challenges, this study introduces an optimized predictive pipeline using the Gradient Boost algorithm to estimate foot length and horizontal breadth with accuracy. Unlike traditional predictive models that rely on generalized features such as BMI, gender, height, or weight, our model leverages refined anthropometric parameters from the ANSUR II dataset to achieve higher accuracy. The predicted values are used to generate a 2D outline of the sole, which is then converted into G-code compatible with CNC machines for contactless, precision-cut insole manufacturing. This approach significantly streamlines the production of custom orthopedic soles, offering scalable, non-invasive, and clinically relevant solutions for individualized foot care. Accurate determination of foot dimensions is critical to diagnosing and treating flat feet, diabetic foot ulcers, plantar fasciitis, and limb-length disparities. Traditional casting and manual mensuration methods are slow, error-prone, and rely on clinical judgment and skill, and commercial image-based solutions are commonly marred by imprecision due to occlusions and perspective distortions. The new Gradient Boost predictive pipeline offers a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate alternative by predicting horizontal breadth and foot length from anthropometric inputs. With automatic generation of CNC-compatible G-code from predicted mensuration, the system enables rapid production of customized orthopedic soles and insoles with minimal manual intervention. This elevates patient comfort, reduces risk of pressure-related injuries and damage, and enhances mobility outcomes, especially among diabetic, geriatric populations, and post-surgical individuals. The solution is interoperable with modern telemedicine and digital orthotics workflows and enables scalable deployment within rehab units, home-based environments, and hospital settings."

In the digital era, social media platforms like X provide abundant text data that can be leveraged to analyze public sentiment toward flood-related events. This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of the IndoBERT model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for sentiment classification on flood-related tweets in Indonesia. The analysis involves three different feature representation techniques Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Word2Vec embeddings for contextual representation. Additionally, the impact of Chi- Square feature selection on classification accuracy is examined. The dataset consists of 1080 Indonesian-language tweets collected through a crawling process and labeled automatically using a pretrained sentiment classification model. Results indicate that sentiment in the dataset is dominated by the negative class (62.7%), reflecting public concern and criticism toward flood management efforts. SVM+TF-IDF achieved the highest score for accuracy about 92.35% without feature selection and 0.92 for the evaluation matric, while IndoBERT also demonstrated strong performance on the same dataset compared to Word2Vec and after Chi-Square feature selection. These findings suggest that frequency-based features remain effective for short-text sentiment tasks using SVM, while contextual embeddings from models like IndoBERT offer promising complementary approaches."

To address this, we propose a lightweight and high-precision detection model, PSM-YOLO, based on the YOLOv10 framework. The model introduces a PASP-Path for small-object awareness, integrating Parallel Patch Attention (PPA) and Spatially Preserving Convolution (SPD-Conv) to enhance perception of small targets and critical local regions. The original detection head is replaced with a Detect_MBConv module, which combines inverted residual blocks and SE attention to significantly reduce computation and model size. Finally, the PIoU_v2 loss function is employed, incorporating geometric penalties and a non-monotonic attention mechanism to improve localization accuracy and convergence stability for medium-quality samples. Experimental results on a custom student behavior dataset show that PSM-YOLO achieves 87.9% mAP@50 while maintaining a compact model size of only 4.1 MB, striking a balance between accuracy and lightweight design suitable for embedded edge deployment. This study offers a practical algorithmic framework for small-object modeling and trustworthy deployment in smart education systems, with broad applicability in embedded AI, edge computing, and intelligent educational environments."

The key to ensuring the quality of block adjustment is obtaining sufficient, reliable, and evenly distributed tie points through image matching. However, the automatic image matching technology is affected by multiple factors, such as imaging geometry, radiation quality, land cover, imaging time, etc., which lead to observation anomalies such as weak connections and disconnection of images in an image block. Particularly, when the scale of an image block is large, various observation anomalies may exist, which can neither be found in block adjustment through counting the number of tie points nor can be detected by the test of the relative positioning accuracy of tie points after block adjustment, resulting in inhomogeneous internal accuracy of an image block and severely affecting the quality of block adjustment. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an automatic detection method for observation anomalies based on accuracy propagation within an image block, which achieves the accurate detection of various observation anomalies in the block beforehand to ensure the quality of block adjustment."

The performance of a User Equipment (UE) in each BWP depends on various factors such as its positioning, channel conditions, and fading. Due to these factors, a UE may perform relatively better in one BWP as compared to another. Considering this variation in performance, dynamically choosing the best BWP for a UE helps in increasing the throughput and reducing the delay to achieve better spectral efficiency. In this work, we address this problem through an MDP (Markov Decision Process) formulation which is solved using a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) model. We highlight how our solution can also flexibly consider the different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) required for different service types and UE priority classes to achieve better system performance overall. Using a time window based approach, the inference overhead is also reduced, and we discuss methods to address some potential deployment issues. We test the solution in various scenarios, achieving improvements of up to 50 in delay and 17 in throughput."

While Tsetlin Machines (TMs) achieve competitive performance in static pattern recognition, they process samples independently, limiting the application to sequential learning requiring temporal dependencies. This paper introduces the Recurrent Tsetlin Machine (RTM), extending TMs to sequential learning by using clause outputs from previous time steps as the recurrent state. This approach preserves TM’s interpretable Boolean operations while enabling temporal pattern recognition. The RTM evaluation on the C-element learning demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to conventional TMs (>95% vs 57%), with the model naturally converging to Finite State Machine representations that autonomously discover Mealy-machine-like behaviour with deterministic state transitions. This work establishes the first successful recurrent extension of Tsetlin Machines, opening opportunities for interpretable sequential learning."

In serially mounted semiconductor arrangements, forced-air cooling often produces a progressive heating effect, causing downstream devices to operate at higher temperatures. This non-uniform thermal loading leads to localised hotspots, accelerated material degradation, and reduced operational reliability. This paper investigates passive geometric optimisation of an air-cooled aluminium heatsink to enhance thermal uniformity across three serially mounted IGBTs. A computational numerical model was developed in ANSYS Fluent, using steady-state simulations and validated by experimental temperature measurements from a physical test rig. The baseline model demonstrated temperature differences across the length of the heatsink of up to 7.85°C at 100W, confirming the presence of a significant temperature gradient. Geometric modifications were evaluated in the form of a step-cut recess in the heatsink fins. The optimised geometry, with recess depths of 31 mm and 14 mm, reduced the temperature difference to 0.43°C under identical operating conditions, representing over 90% improvement compared to the unmodified design. The findings demonstrate that position-specific geometric tailoring of heatsinks offers a cost-effective and manufacturable solution to improve temperature synchronisation in multi-device power systems."

The basis is constructed on the basis of a general solution for the medium, in which the spatial state is represented as a superposition of flat auxiliary states, for the formation of which a fundamental system of polynomials is used. After constructing a basis for a spatial state, it is orthonormalized and the desired state is expanded into a Fourier series according to the elements of the orthonormal basis. The problem comes down to finding the Fourier coefficients, which are quadratures.A solution is presented for a circular cylinder made of transversely isotropic siltstone and subject to the action of a mass force that varies according to the law of sine and cosine.

    "abstract": "RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) performs well in a lossless network. However, its performance drops dramatically when packet loss occurs. This limitation stems from the shortcomings of traditional solutions in packet loss recovery, which are explicitly reflected in the two stages of packet loss detection and packet loss retransmission. For packet loss detection, they either rely on implicit detection, which leads to misjudgment or use explicit notification methods that cannot effectively detect multiple lost packets. For packet loss retransmission, they either adopt the Go-back-N mechanism, which is inefficient or implement selective retransmission that still fails to retransmit all missing segments accurately. To address these issues, we propose SNACK, a novel packet recovery mechanism that combines explicit notification and selective NACK(negative acknowledgment) retransmission. SNACK brings two key improvements. First, it precisely detects lost packets through dynamic window monitoring. Second, it adapts to retransmission using SNACK frames, which can selectively request missing packets. Our NS-3 simulation results show that SNACK achieves strong performance under packet loss. When the loss rate is 1%, SNACK keeps the throughput within 10% of the lossless case. In multiflow scenarios, it reduces the average FCT (Flow Completion Time) by 24.8% compared to existing methods. These results demonstrate that SNACK provides efficient loss recovery in various network conditions."

With the known orbital parameters of the SAR satellite, the calibration satellite parameters are appropriately designed based on Relative Orbital Element Method(ROEM), allowing the small calibration satellite to operate in a coordinated formation with the SAR satellite. In this formation, the SAR satellite can frequently observe and image the calibration satellite under the side-looking acquisition geometry, and calculate the calibration factor(CF). The proposed method reduces reliance on groundbased calibration sites, enables calibration intervals to align with the orbital period, and extends the capability for inorbit radiometric performance evaluation. More importantly, the entire calibration process is performed in the space environment, free from distortions caused by atmosphere, ionosphere, ground clutter, multipath effects and ambiguities, ensuring a truly ‘end-to-end’ measurement process."

At the same time, the competing ferromagnetic contributions of Fe and Ni with the antiferromagnetic tendencies of Mn and Cr enable a wide range of magnetic responses. In this work, three FeNiCrMnAl alloys with varying Al content are synthesized and analyzed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The results show a consistent convergence between EDS and LIBS data, with some Mn discrepancies attributed to matrix effects. Magnetic characterization reveals predominantly soft ferromagnetic behavior with low coercivity and composition-dependent anisotropy, most notably in the Al-containing alloys. These findings confirm that FeNiCrMnAl alloys combine structural stability, magnetic tunability, and sustainability, making them promising candidates for cost-effective sensor applications."

This scoping review state-of-the-art solutions for real-time simulation, organizing them by key concepts: multiagent architectures, AI-enhanced simulation, real-time platforms, engines and gamified simulation environments. We observe that multi-agent systems (MAS) are widely used to model interacting entities, providing a realistic representation of complex scenarios. AI-driven simulation frameworks enable adaptive scenario management and personalized feedback based on user performance. Many modern simulators leverage game engines (e.g. Unity, Unreal Engine) as platforms for interactive 3D and 2D visualization. Gamified “serious game” environments create immersive, interactive scenarios that enhance learning and decision-making. Overall, the review highlights a convergence of AI, game technology, and networking in current real-time simulation solutions, and identifies future research directions for these integrated systems."

The proposed tracking method is based on a human detection module that combines camera and LiDAR data to improve environmental perception capabilities using the YOLOv7 algorithm with sensor fusion. Following maximum accuracy human detection, the instantaneous position of the detected person is determined as the target, and optimal path following toward this target is achieved using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. The MPC algorithm predict the required steering angle in real-time to reach the detected person by considering the vehicle's current state and dynamic constraints, while the speed value is calculated according to the remaining distance to the target. This method allows the car to track the detected person without requiring any external intervention. MPC-based tracking mechanisms in autonomous vehicle technologies are proven to be effective by the system created in this study, which exhibits reliable and secure human tracking in dynamic situations."

In this study, we developed and programmed a custom-built drone equipped with four 1500 kV brushless motors, a flight controller, 60-amp ESC, GPS, and a DJI O3 video transmission system. The hardware was assembled onto a carbon fiber frame with 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) components, and a Raspberry Pi 5 was integrated for real-time inferencing. The AI model for crop disease detection was trained using drone collected data and publicly available datasets from Kaggle, leveraging PyTorch with Python3 on an HPC Cluster with an Nvidia H100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7453 CPU. Autonomous drone flight paths were planned using Litchi waypoint navigation software to create an autonomous point-to-point navigation flight path. Using the training data a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) vanilla model was developed for training and inferencing the crop diseases from the images used in the dataset. Four major crops-corn, potato, rice, and wheat- covering 10 distinct diseases were analyzed. The model achieved an accuracy between 75% and 95% for most cases, except for rice crops, where performance was lower due to the thin leaves providing fewer distinguishing features. This issue can be mitigated with additional image augmentation and fine-tuning the CNN model. Although several challenges were encountered in securing access to local farms for large-scale testing, preliminary evaluations in controlled environments-including select accessible field and park settings-yielded promising results. Field testing confirmed the drone's ability to capture high-quality images even in light rain and cloudy conditions. The system, which costs under $ 500, achieved a maximum flight time of 27 minutes, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional soil sensors and soil culture testing. The early identification of crop diseases enables targeted interventions, conserving resources, reducing excessive pesticide use, and increasing crop yields."

This work proposes a novel and detailed hardware architecture for the MLR algorithm. The architecture supports both the training and testing phases of prediction operation. A linear system is solved in MLR to find the co-efficient vector. In this work, this linear system in the training phase is solved by the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm which is an iterative algorithm. CG algorithm supports maximum resource sharing and gives better accuracy than other iterative algorithms. The architecture also uses a Gold-Schmidt iterative divider to reduce hardware complexity. The architecture is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) for validation of performance with a freely available database of student performance analysis with 5 independent variables. A relative signal-to-ratio (RSNR) of 36 dB is achieved in this work in estimating the co-efficient vector using the CG algorithm and an RSNR of 28 dB is obtained in the prediction of 256 samples. The proposed architecture is hardware efficient, supports online sample-wise training, and has less overall training time compared to all existing works. The architecture is easily applicable to all real-time applications and scalable for any parameter values."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of wireless communication networks has significantly advanced over the last decade, however, multifaceted challenges persist, especially in urban areas and highspeed environments that combat multipath fading and Doppler spread. Urban terrains characterized by dense infrastructure, high population density, and high-rise buildings cause signal interference, multipath propagation, and shadowing, thus resulting in poor reliability of communication links and quality of service (QoS). This paper investigates a RIS-assisted ZPOTFS system operating at mm-Wave (millimeter-Wave) frequencies for high-speed wireless scenarios to mitigate severe fading and Doppler spread limitations. Three different scenarios are modeled using appropriate 5G NR TDL channels. Performance measures, BER and throughput, are estimated and analyzed for different geographical scenarios featuring distinct surrounding dynamics, user speed, and array size of RIS. The results obtained demonstrate enhanced BER and throughput for RIS-assisted ZPOTFS systems, and offer insights for future system architecture in high-mobility 5 G and beyond 5 G (B5G) networks paradigm."

In this work, we propose IDTM, an IDS based on the Tsetlin Machine (TM), using its logic-based learning mechanism to perform accurate and explainable classification of network traffic using the CIC-IDS dataset. To address significant challenges associated with class imbalance and high dimensionality, we employ the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), random undersampling, followed by Min-Max normalization and tailored binarization strategies. Features are discretized according to their statistical distribution: logarithmic transformation for highly skewed time-based features, quantile binning for bursty rate-based features, and uniform binning for others. This ensures compatibility with TM’s binary input requirements. Subsequently, Variance Thresholding and Extra Trees-based feature ranking were used to reduce noise to allow the model to focus on only informative features. Experimental results show that the TM achieves a high test accuracy of 99.07% while significantly outperforming conventional models in terms of inference time, demonstrating its potential as a lightweight, interpretable, and real-time-capable IDS solution. Additionally, the interpretable results demonstrate the importance of the various features of the data."

Existing datasets for this task are primarily designed for image-to-image matching, lack textual annotations, and mainly contain pedestrian groups captured from ground-based surveillance, with limited aerial perspectives. Due to the inter-group diversity and intragroup complexity of pedestrian groups, existing methods struggle to achieve robust alignment between visual and textual features of groups. To address these limitations, we introduce two cross-modal group datasets. First, we construct UAV-T by adding fine-grained textual descriptions to the existing UAV dataset. Second, we construct a new dataset by synthesizing UAV-based group images from the AG-ReID.v2 dataset: pedestrians captured from the same viewpoint are concatenated to form groups, and corresponding textual descriptions are provided to enable text-to-image group matching. Moreover, we propose Member-Guided Multimodal Alignment (MGMA) framework, a cross-modal group matching framework that effectively learns group-level representations by extracting and aligning visual and textual features of group members. Specifically, it models individual group members via Bbox-guided Masked Image Modeling (BMIM) and Masked Group Attribute Modeling (MGAM) modules to enable cross-modal interactions of group features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves noticeable improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches on both the AG-Group and UAV-T datasets."

    "abstract": "Given the prevalence in recent years of computergenerated ideas including constructors, email flooders, spoofers. This has now made it relatively easy for users, especially those who have little IT expertise to come up with slight modifications of the existing malware. In order to counter these threats, scholars have come up with infinite countermeasures including, static and dynamic malware analysis. These techniques are often unable to identify new malware in the main memory of the computer and otherwise involve significant work and special knowledge in the field. This project presents a memory dump analysis for malware detection with image processing and machine learning and blockchain for security and consensus. Raw data received from memory dumps is in the form of an array, which is transformed into RGB images, and from which features are identified by employing HOG descriptors. The classifiers adopted for detecting malware include Support Vector Machine (SVM) RBF kernel, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forests. The results achieved are then checked through a blockchain voting system, the nodes perform the same task of discriminating between malicious files or benign files followed by consensus mechanisms to check for its accuracy and its immunity to any form of alteration. This approach interfaces visual analytics and distributed policy decisions for large scale, trustworthy, malware detection."

Traditional machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks, struggle to capture the complex geometric structures in radar data, limiting their accuracy. This study applies the Graph Neural Operator (GNO) to NASA's Snow Radar dataset, representing radar images as graphs with nodes for spatial points and edges for local dependencies. GNO outperforms GCNs and GraphSAGE, achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) and providing accurate predictions of internal ice layer thickness, even in regions with high variability. These results highlight the potential of neural operators for advancing radar-based ice sheet modeling and geophysical analysis."

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is widely used to measure physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen saturation, and it is easily integrated into the wearables due to its small size and affordability. In recent years, the morphological and temporal features of PPG signals have been used to comprehend the physiological mechanisms associated with healthy and pathological conditions. Despite its wide range of applications above water, its use underwater remains limited. This study examines the effect of waterproofing materials such as epoxy and silicon on the waveform features of the PPG signal. The PPG sensor used is MAX30102, and the materials are coated on its surface. The PPG signal is recorded from healthy participants for 5 minutes as they remain seated. The collected signal is pre-processed using a Chebyshev Type II bandpass filter, and six features, namely systolic peak, diastolic peak, dicrotic notch, peak-to-peak interval, systolic time and diastolic time, are extracted from the signal and compared with uncoated and coated surfaces. The signal features are also compared with different thicknesses of silicon coating. The signal quality index (SQI) for epoxy, silicone, and uncoated sensor surfaces has no significant difference. The systolic amplitude is decreased by $17 \\%$ for silicon and $46 \\%$ for epoxy. The peak-to-peak interval has no significant difference for the three cases, which suggests that the PPG signal frequency remains unaffected. The findings indicated that silicone is more suitable compared to epoxy for waterproofing, paving the way for future progress in wearable underwater health monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of feeder link switching in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) by leveraging low Earth orbit (LEO) mega-constellations with multiple shells and multiple gateway (GW) deployments. Due to the high mobility of LEO satellites and frequent feeder link disruptions, it is critical to maintain reliable feeder link connectivity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework that combines virtual network embedding (VNE) with advanced feeder link switching strategies. To manage the trade-off between link quality and switching frequency, lower-level optimization maximizes the data transmitted per feeder link connection using a path-finding algorithm with bisection search. The upper-level VNE problem enhances the connectivity between the satellites in the LEO mega-constellation and the ground infrastructure by constructing a dedicated virtual network for NTN GWs. Simulation results based on the Starlink Gen II constellation demonstrate that our proposed method consistently ensures 100% satellite activation, while baseline benchmarks achieve 93% satellite activation rates in the real-world GW deployments. Our optimization framework is well-suited for multiple shell deployments of LEO mega-constellations with multiple GW supports, paving the way for globally connected NTNs."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of intelligent surveillance technology, the massive amount of multimodal data (e.g., videos, images, and text) has imposed higher demands on efficient information retrieval and security. Traditional single-modal retrieval methods struggle to meet practical requirements, making multimodal image-text retrieval a research hotspot in this field. Existing approaches, however, still face challenges in fine-grained semantic alignment and suffer from rigid matching mechanisms. To address these issues, this paper introduces SeaNcr, a novel framework that integrates cross-modal semantic entity alignment with non-correspondence reasoning. Our method constructs class-level entity representations enhanced by saliency-guided masking to capture discriminative semantic features. A pseudo-frozen asynchronous optimization strategy is introduced to maintain semantic consistency across modalities by associating stable entity representations with dynamically updated encoder features. Moreover, to overcome rigid matching, we design a non-correspondence reasoning module that jointly leverages intra-modal similarity and cross-modal mutual nearest neighbor constraints, optimizing matching flexibility and generalization. Extensive experiments validate that SeaNcr significantly enhances cross-modal feature representation and retrieval robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple person re-identification benchmarks."

We propose SymScrab, a simple physical layer solution that significantly improves the security of LoRa without affecting the communication performance or consuming more communication resources. SymScrab encrypts the message by scrambling the baseband samples with a pseudo-random permutation, which is easy to recover by the legitimate receiver who has the same permutation, but impossible for an adversary. We further propose a physical layer Message Integrity Check (MIC) that rejects spoofed packets because spoofed packets do not exhibit expected physical layer features. We provide a rigorous security analysis of SymScrab and prove guarantees for confidentiality and integrity. We implement SymScrab as an extension to the open-source implementation of LoRa, and test it with both over-the-air experiments and simulations. The results confirm that SymScrab does not negatively affect communication performance."

Firstly, we employ a neural network (NN) to approximate the nonlinear uncertainties. Then, an adaptive NN-based event-triggered (ET) feedback control scheme is designed. This scheme mitigates the chattering effect resulting from high-frequency switching by incorporating an adaptive boundary layer method. Notably, the proposed dynamic triggering function relies only on agents' local state, without continuous communication with neighboring agents. It is theoretically shown that consensus error is ultimately uniformly bounded. Additionally, Zeno behavior is also shown to be excluded. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Based on projected climatic trends, the U.S. dairy industry faces escalating heat stress challenges, with milk production losses projected to reach 1.4 kg/day per cow by the 2050s and 1.9 kg/day per cow by the 2080s, resulting in economic losses of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. While extensive cooling mechanisms are in place, they cannot fully mitigate heat stress effects. Thermotolerance, influenced by physiological and behavioral traits, varies significantly among individual cows and is crucial for sustaining dairy productivity. This paper presents an approach for automatically monitoring and recognizing behavior for dairy cows potentially relevant to thermotolerance, which utilizes various Machine Learning (ML) (e.g., CNN and YOLOv8) and Computer Vision (CV) (e.g., Video Processing and Annotation) techniques aimed at quantifying key behavioral indicators, specifically drinking frequency, brush use-behaviors, and social interactions such as headbutting. We evaluated the developed system using two different video datasets. The first dataset was captured using cameras installed at a side angle, while the second dataset was obtained using top-down camera views. Evaluation results showed that the YOLOv8 and CNN models achieved classification accuracies of 93% and 96%, respectively, on the first dataset, while the second dataset yielded 94% for YOLOv8 and 96% for CNN. Beyond experimental validation, the model is currently deployed for large-scale analysis of over 38,000 video recordings from a commercial ranch in Texas. This deployment enables automated extraction of behavioral event counts, specifically drinking and brushing, for each video, providing high-resolution behavioral summaries at scale. These findings show the robustness and operational viability of the system. The insights gained from this work hold significant promise for advancing genetic selection and management practices, equipping the dairy industry to proactively address heat stress and enhance overall herd resilience in the face of evolving climatic challenges."

    "abstract": "As the sixth-generation (6G) networks evolve towards a deep integration of communication and computation (ICC), they face challenges of inherent interference and resource competition between heterogeneous services. To address this issue, this paper investigates an uplink ICC system enhanced by a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), where SIM’s unique multi-layer structure transforms the wireless channel into a controllable, task-oriented medium. The system is designed to support the coexistence of over-the-air computation (AirComp) tasks, which require high-precision results, and traditional tasks that demand high-quality communication. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization framework aiming to minimize the total mean squared error (MSE) of all computation tasks while strictly guaranteeing the communication quality of service (QoS). To solve the highly non-convex problem of synergistically designing the system resources, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only converges rapidly but also achieves up to a 95.2% reduction in total computation MSE compared to an ICC system without SIM, while also significantly outperforming other benchmark schemes, validating the great potential of SIM in proactively managing multi-service conflicts and enabling efficient ICC."

To address this, we introduce a mechanism using random linear network coding in mesh topologies, where nodes adaptively collect and forward packets based on network conditions such as bandwidth and link quality. Evaluations show that our method enables low-latency delivery even under constrained bandwidth scenarios, and can suppress key usage compared to conventional IP multicast over single-tree topologies, depending on network scale and structure."

However, conventional MPC cannot seamlessly incorporate high-frequency signal injection (HFSI), resulting in unstable encoderless operation at zero and low speeds. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-vector predictive encoderless scheme that simply combines multiple predictive voltage vectors with injected high-frequency signals for accurate rotor-position estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively injects high-frequency voltage signals and achieves stable encoderless operation in the zero- and low-speed regions."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of distributed secure state estimation for cyber-physical systems under sparse sensor attacks. Traditional centralized methods struggle with high computational complexity in large-scale systems, while existing distributed approaches either require strong robustness constraints for graphs or face challenges due to local unobservability. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed adaptive saturation method. This method designs an adaptive saturation function for each node to limit the impact of attacks on the estimation residual. Additionally, it integrates a consensus protocol to enable cooperative estimation of nodes, effectively mitigating the influence of malicious attacks. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm ensures consensus estimation under fixed attack channels, with estimation errors ultimately bounded. Furthermore, by refining the saturation mechanism for each node, the algorithm is extended to scenarios with time-varying attacks. Simulation experiments validate that the proposed method effectively handles sparse sensor attacks, reduces computational complexity, and significantly enhances system robustness."

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of mean-square stability and stabilization under an energy harvesting sensor, where the sensor can harvest energy from the external environment. When the sensor's energy is insufficient to maintain regular communication between the sensor and the controller, the sampled data packets are regarded as missing. Otherwise, they can be successfully transmitted in the communication network. To address this problem, we first establish a continuous-time modeling framework for a class of randomly sampled systems with an energy harvesting sensor. Then, a corresponding discrete-time stochastic model is constructed. By establishing the equivalence between the continuous-time and resulting discrete-time systems, a stabilizing controller is designed to guarantee the mean-square stability of randomly sampled systems. In particular, the limit of the probability of successfully transmitting sampled packets is derived, which plays a critical role in the equivalence analysis of systems, as well as the controller design. Finally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller design strategy, where both energy-harvestingconstrained and energy-harvesting-constraint-free scenarios are illustrated."

However, conventional push-broom systems rely on back-end PCs for spectral analysis, resulting in substantial data transfer overhead and limiting their applicability in real-time, energy-efficient edge scenarios. To address this, we propose an integrated sensing–computing processor. A complete hyperspectral imaging electronics system is developed, along with an dual-branch model, push-broom vision transformer (PBViT), which combines a frequency-domain encoding branch with an improved ViT architecture and contains only 0.075 MB of parameters. On the CHM dataset, PBViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with an OA of 0.978, AA of 0.942, and Kappa of 0.950, surpassing traditional machine learning, convolutional, and ViT-based methods. Leveraging quantization-aware training (QAT), the model is compressed to 8-bit precision with negligible accuracy loss. We further develop an FPGA-based accelerator for PBViT, achieving 502 GOPS throughput and 32.2 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\mathbf{s}$</tex-math></inline-formula> latency per <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$9\\boldsymbol{\\times} 9$</tex-math></inline-formula> patch, with a power consumption of 14.42 W.

This research designs a UPQC by optimally selecting the gains of a FOPIDC, the inductance and resistance values of filters, and the gain parameters for the PIC of the storage battery and wind energy systems. It also optimizes the parameters of DC-DC boost and buck-boost converters using the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). Additionally, this work employs a Levenberg-Marquardt Back propagation (LMBP) neural network (NN) control for accurate reference signal generation. The main goal is to address PQ issues like interruptions, sags, harmonic distortion, swell, DC-link voltage balancing, and reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the source current in a grid-connected system that integrates wind energy systems (WES), solar energy, and EVs. The study also introduces a novel power flow algorithm that manages the transfer of power between the renewable sources, grid, EVs and battery storage, thereby facilitating seamless power exchange between solar/wind/battery systems, the grid, and consumer/ industrial loads. This facilitates to ensure a consistent power supply, efficient demand fulfillment, and optimal use of generated power. The study demonstrates that the optimized UPQC, collectively with power flow management, can successfully address PQ issues and achieve efficient power sharing with reduced THD levels of 3.58%, 1.22%, and 4.36%.

    "abstract": "Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is crucial for semantic segmentation (SS) in agriculture applications. However, cloud contamination introduces time gaps in SITS, disrupting temporal dependencies and causing feature shifts, which decreases the performance of models pre-trained on complete SITS. Existing methods typically address this challenge by reconstructing the entire SITS before prediction or using data augmentation to simulate missing data. Yet, full reconstruction may introduce noise and redundancy, whereas the data augmentation model can only handle limited missing patterns, leading to poor generalization. We propose a joint learning framework with feature reconstruction and prediction to address incomplete SITS more effectively. Specifically, we simulate temporal missing scenarios using temporal masks. The two tasks are guided by both ground-truth labels and the teacher model trained on complete SITS. The prediction task constrains the model from selectively reconstructing temporal features, ensuring they align with the teacher’s complete representations and are beneficial for prediction. It reduces unnecessary reconstruction and limits noise propagation. By integrating reconstructed features into the prediction task, the model avoids learning shortcuts and maintains its ability to handle varied missing patterns and complete SITS. The experiments show strong generalization capabilities in multiple aspects: (1) Different SS tasks, including cropland extraction and crop classification; (2) Different study areas, including Hunan Province,Western France, and Catalonia; (3) Different sensors, primarily Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope; (4) Different numbers of time gaps, while retaining the model’s performance on complete SITS; (5) Different model architectures, including seven typical backbones.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a promising solution for emergency communications due to their rapid deployment and capability of flexible network formation. This flexibility enables UAVs to dynamically adjust their positions and link configurations to form stable multi-hop networks, thereby establishing resilient data links from isolated disaster areas to remote base stations. However, sustaining such a persistent UAV swarm network is challenging due to limited onboard energy, the scarcity of available UAVs, and complex coordination in emergencies. This paper aims to minimize the number of UAVs required while ensuring continuous multi-hop connectivity for all target areas under energy constraints. We propose a UAV swarm planning strategy based on non-fixed relay points (USP-NFRP), jointly optimizing UAV-to-target associations, trajectories, and the backhaul topology connecting target areas to the base station. First, we propose a periodic rotation path (PRP) method to efficiently manage UAV replacements and assignments at disaster sites. We also provide a mathematical proof of its effectiveness. Second, we propose a dynamic tree backhaul link (DTBL) method that ensures persistent and seamless network connectivity. It is achieved by adjusting the positional roles of relay nodes (fixed or non-fixed) during path planning and dynamically configuring tree-based backhaul links during UAV missions. Finally, we develop a max-min ant system-based path planning algorithm (MMAS-PP) to optimize UAV trajectories and the sequence of task executions. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy reduces the number of UAVs by up to 30.9% compared with baselines."

The need for a more decentralised electricity network has emerged, in contrast to the large centralised system. A smart grid is an electricity network that uses information and communication technologies to gather information about the habits of suppliers and consumers, and then uses this information to automatically increase the efficiency, reliability, economy and sustainability of the grid. We are currently living in an era of energy transition, with smart grids operating mainly through pilot projects. In our research, we analysed in-depth interviews with smart grid experts, mainly practitioners, to find out how they perceive the problems and challenges of smart grid management. As little empirical research has been published so far on the attitudes of utilities of smart grids, our research is unique. We have found that smart grid experts with extensive experience focus primarily on utilities, in their view they are the key players in smart grids. In addition, some of them are aware of the complexity of smart grid management."

They can be applied to resource inventory management and energy problems, such as fuel and energy cost allocation. A software implementation of the algorithms in Python was developed and implemented. Quantitative performance evaluations of the swarm algorithms were obtained using three criteria: convergence rate, accuracy of the approximate solution, and stability of results across repeated runs. It was found that the bee colony algorithm demonstrated stability and the ability to perform global search, especially with increasing problem complexity. The particle swarm method demonstrates high convergence rates on smooth functions but is prone to premature stabilization at local minima."

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) and DT technologies offer promising avenues for early detection, their adoption in clinical settings introduces significant concerns around data security, system vulnerabilities, and model trust. In response, this paper proposes a novel, trusted medical AI framework that combines blockchain-based device authentication, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and DT technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy, data integrity, and system resilience. The proposed system leverages ResNet for lung condition classification from CT scans, augmented by Grad-CAM for visual explainability, enabling clinicians to interpret AI-driven decisions confidently. A blockchain-based whitelist mechanism authenticates medical devices before data contribution, mitigating risks of tampered or unverified input. Furthermore, the framework integrates explainable digital twin visualization to simulate patient-specific predictions and embeds a vulnerability detection layer to identify and mitigate software flaws in medical IoT and DT components. This comprehensive solution addresses key challenges in real-world healthcare: ensuring data authenticity, interpretability, and cyber resilience, paving the way for secure, transparent, and trustworthy AI-driven diagnostics."

The paper analyzes one of such systems, namely the stability of homeostasis functioning, which is characterized by a certain variability as a result of reaction to the external environment. Analysis of the state of homeostasis is especially important in studies of a human operator, whose professional activity is associated with the constant influence of destabilization factors, in particular, the operator of the aviation industry, in which the human factor occupies a special place. Therefore, the article considers the urgent task of developing methodological approaches to analyzing the stability of the state of operators based on existing biodata to obtain additional useful insights that will expand the understanding of the phase state of a biological object based on time series. The use of nonlinear dynamics methods makes it possible to analyze the phase state of an object and study the chaotic nature of its behavior, which in turn makes it possible, based on the additional information obtained, to assess the level of stability of the operator's functional state, which makes it possible to predict violations and, as a result, eliminate the threat of failure to fulfill duties in the professional sphere, and reduce the overall level of risk in the socio-technical system."

One of the indicators of energy security is gross oil consumption, the forecasting of which allows to see the prospective use of fuel types and changes in the structure of the energy balance. MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks were used to construct short-term forecasts for 2 years ahead. Time series of different lengths were considered with 80, 88, 126 initial points, which were the values of gross oil consumption of each month. Such data are available in national statistics since 2015. The simulation was performed with different neural network parameters. The number of hidden neurons was minimal (1 or 2) and maximal (4, 6, 8, 9). Identity, logistic, hyperbolic and exponential functions in various combinations were used as the activation functions of hidden neurons and the output neuron. A series of models were obtained, which were analyzed using network performance analysis and graphical visualization. Forecasts showed close results in all models in terms of convergence of calculated and actual values (at the level of 5–8%). Annual values of gross oil consumption were calculated using the best calculation model. During the modeling process, it was found that increasing the number of hidden neurons and the type of activation functions slightly affects the performance of neural networks, and increasing the length of the series improves the quality of the forecast. The quality of forecasts for the last two years was checked. The discrepancy between the predicted and actual annual values for these years was 7.7% and (-4.6%), and for the entire series of values, on average, it was (-1.4%). The use of neural networks for short-term forecasting showed satisfactory results, and the method can be used to forecast other indicators."

Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-knowledge-integrated “clustering-forecasting” framework accurately forecasts contemporaneous regular employee behavioral efficiency while establishing an end-to-end research paradigm from raw data to precise predictive decision-making."

    "abstract": "Menu interaction in Mixed Reality (XR) is a particularly complex aspect of user experience, especially when using hands-only input. Different menu designs offer distinct tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, intuitiveness, physical effort, and visibility. These tradeoffs are rarely one-size-fits-all, and their real impact on user performance and satisfaction remains underexplored. To address this, our work investigates how these design differences influence interaction quality, aiming to identify which menu style offers the best overall compromise for practical use. In this context, the paper proposes to evaluate different menus for hand interaction in XR. In this work, we propose and evaluate three different design menus, each tested with hand-tracking and controller input (1-Radial Wrist Menu, 2-Radial Motion Menu, 3-Mobile Phone Menu, see in section III), using Aratall's<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>1http://www.aratall.com prototype application for 3D urban planning, PassageXR as a case study. A user study was conducted to evaluate the three proposals regarding selection speed, responsiveness, and overall user satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm for collecting large-scale data by using distributed sensors on smartphones and wearables. However, building comprehensive spatiotemporal fields of measurements with continuous sensing at all locations and time cycles is often impractical and costly. To address this, we leverage our proposed Learned Gumbel-Based Active Sparse MCS framework, utilizing an Encoder-Decoder Time Series Transformer that reconstructs the full spatiotemporal field for a given sensing cycle using the data collected by a small subset of available sensors. The framework incorporates a selector that actively employs the Gumbel distribution to dynamically pick the most effective sensors for the next sensing cycle. Rather than applying a single selector layer across all sensors, we introduce a patched forecasting approach to account for temporal patterns inherent in sensing cycles. Each patch forecasts its own subsequence of the time series while simultaneously selecting a subset of sensors to reuse in the next sensing cycle."

Despite the growing need from government bodies to leverage satellite earth observation for the management of WoNS, limited studies have been conducted in Australia exploring the application of satellite remote sensor data for the detection of blackberry. This research examined the efficacy of high-resolution imagery sourced from the SkySat earth imaging satellites combined with a random forest (RF) classification algorithm for detecting blackberry infestations in Australia. The study estimated the change in blackberry infestation between El Niño and La Niña seasons. The RF model using spectral information alone achieved a producer accuracy of 99.1% and a user accuracy of 98.7% while using the textural GLCM features alone, the producer accuracy was 91% and user accuracy was 95.5%. The combination of the spectral and textural GLCM features produced an RF model that achieved a producer accuracy of 98.2% while the user accuracy was 99.4%. The study observed that blackberry infestations were fivefold higher during the period coinciding with the climatic phenomenon La Niña, which was characterised by widespread changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures. This study paves the way for future investigations into satellite remote sensing and machine learning for managing WoNS in Australia."

Particular attention is paid to the influence of power losses — diffraction, ohmic and excitation-related — on the Q-factor and efficiency of ORs. It is shown that accurate modeling of the coupling coefficients of slot elements is a complex task that requires simplified theoretical models and experimental verification. It is established that slot elements provide stable frequency characteristics and effective spectrum compression in semi-symmetric ORs. Methods for estimating losses using Fresnel numbers, approximation formulas and adjustment parameters are proposed. The results presented allow us to deepen our understanding of the loss mechanisms and optimize the design of high-frequency resonators, increasing their efficiency in practical applications."

The analysis places particular emphasis on capital expenditure (CAPEX), operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and payback periods under the prevailing tariff structure for renewable electricity in the country. For the smaller configurations of 50 MW and 200 MW, the results indicate an LCOE of approximately <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.0759 \\text{USD} / \\text{kWh}$</tex>, accompanied by a payback period of nearly 19.3 years. These values highlight the financial challenges faced by small- and medium-scale CSP projects, which remain economically constrained when benchmarked against the current regulated electricity tariff of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.085 \\text{AZN} / \\text{kWh} (\\approx 0.05 \\text{USD} / \\text{kWh})$</tex>. By contrast, the 1 GW case demonstrates a clear advantage of economies of scale: the unit investment cost declines significantly, reducing the LCOE to 0.0395 USD/kWh and shortening the payback period to 7.99 years. This substantial improvement illustrates the pivotal role that large-scale projects could play in overcoming cost barriers and achieving financial viability. Ultimately, this study highlights that while small projects represent the realistic entry point for Azerbaijan, long-term cost reductions and supportive policy measures will be crucial to enable the transition toward economically viable large-scale SPT development."

At stage two, the segments are classified for collective anomalies presence using anomaly analysis methods that work well for collective anomalies. The result of the second stage is the detection of collective anomalies in the data. At stage three, collective anomalies are excluded from the data, and only the remaining point anomalies are searched for using the anomaly analysis methods effective in point anomaly detection. The advantage of the proposed complex approach is that it allows for a high data anomalies detection efficiency."

The antenna array was supposed to be powered with equal amplitude without the ability to control the phase of the signal in individual antenna elements. Such scenarios of using an antenna array can occur when organizing virtual antenna arrays, for example, on mobile media. To minimize the influence of the radiation patterns of individual antenna elements, the study was conducted using the example of half-wave dipoles in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the dipoles. The effect of the placement of antenna elements in the centers of even or odd Fresnel zones of an equivalent focusing system on the properties of the antenna array was studied by numerical simulation. The dependences of the radiation pattern and the gain coefficient on the equivalent focal length, and the frequency dependences of the array gain for different focal lengths are obtained. The behavior of the radiation power flux density generated by the antenna array on the distance from the center of the array is shown. The spatial distributions of the radiation power flux density created by a non-equidistant antenna array and an equidistant array with the same aperture size are compared. Despite the use of a single and suboptimal method for controlling the antenna array parameters, such a structure can be used for wireless charging of low-power devices."

The paper proposes an integrated quality index formed from weighted objective metrics, namely, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, the structural similarity index, and the correlation coefficient. These metrics are calculated for luminance and color-difference signals. Tables of metric values are provided for six intermediate images corresponding to six different exposures, from underexposed to overexposed. The quality index is calculated for each intermediate image involved in the reconstruction of the high-dynamic-range image. Using the set of quality indices, a probability density function is constructed, and statistical metrics are determined. The proposed method allows to predict the quality of the reconstructed high-dynamic-range image, taking into account the contribution of each intermediate image with different exposure times. Based on the analysis of statistical moments, a conclusion is drawn regarding the possibility of optimizing the number of intermediate images."

The method is based on a set of ontologies for modeling expert concepts, a structural model, and a rule base with three types of dietary rules that can describe a wide range of requirements. Besides, we propose an extension of the NSGA-II evolutionary algorithm to support the enforcement of the rules, and a reinforcement learning based mutation operator. The approach has been validated in a smallscale proof-of-concept study with a limited set of foods and rules. The results show the viability of the proposed mutation operator and that the effect of dietary rules can be controlled via the model parameters. Further work is needed to extend the proposed approach to more realistic food and rule bases."

Among these, Snake Keylogger, a.NET-based malware first identified in November 2020, has gained notoriety for its credential-stealing and keylogging capabilities. It primarily propagates through phishing and spear phishing campaigns, typically utilizing malicious Office documents or PDFs to deliver downloader scripts via PowerShell. Once executed, Snake Keylogger captures keystrokes, steals saved credentials, extracts clipboard data, and takes screenshots to exfiltrate sensitive information. As of 2025, Snake Keylogger has continued to evolve, adopting advanced evasion techniques such as process hollowing, the use of suspended child processes for payload injection, and heavily obfuscated code, all of which complicate detection and response efforts. Notably, security reports indicate increasing prevalence and spikes in zero-day detections, underscoring its continued threat to both personal and organizational cybersecurity. In this work, the results of static and dynamic analysis of a snake keylogger are presented. The findings from this analysis contribute to the development of more robust detection, defence, and mitigation strategies against Snake Keylogger and similarly evolving malware familie"

    "abstract": "The influx of massive network device nodes has increased the security threats faced by complex network systems. However, the application of traditional active defense technologies to complex network systems always assumes that the occurrence of network attacks and their impact on the system can be evaluated. In other words, complex network defense systems can achieve robustness against predictable network attacks, but they may still remain fragile when facing unpredictable attacks, or even “Black Swan” attacks. Inspired by the antifragility exhibited by flora and fauna in ecosystems, this paper innovatively studies the antifragility security defense mechanism in the field of network security, aiming to enhance the security defense capabilities of complex network defense systems. Firstly, we define the concept of antifragility for the complex network defense system. Then, the antifragility complex network defense system model is constructed, which includes cyber deception module, service redundancy module and learning and evolution module. To evaluate whether the complex network defense system model possesses antifragility, we propose an antifragility assessment method for the complex network defense system, which analyzes how the system benefits under network attack pressures. Finally, the security and reliability of the antifragility complex network defense system are verified through experiments."

The navigation system employs a stereo depth camera, LiDAR, and an optical flow sensor. To process environmental data more efficiently, the system employs a 'tunnel vision' approach, which narrows the field of view to reduce computational load. This is complemented by a sliding window algorithm for processing the area in a linear manner, systematically searching for landable/landing zones. These algorithms can be effectively applied in GPS-denied environments, such as disaster-stricken areas, to facilitate rapid assessment and mapping of affected zones."

    "abstract": "Accidents involving powered two-wheelers, such as motorcycles and scooters, pose significant safety risks, particularly under low-visibility conditions. Rapid detection and response to these incidents are crucial to minimize injuries and fatalities. This paper presents the development of a system for indicating a fallenpowered two-wheeler that will alert nearby people about the fallen two-wheelers. It will enhance visibility where it cannot be directly visible owing to dark or geometrical conditions with audible loud sirens and lights. The system was designed using a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer, a microcontroller, and an alarm system to enhance accident detection and alert mechanisms. MEMS accelerometer continuously monitored the orientation and motion of the two-wheeler. Upon detecting an abnormal tilt or sudden impact that is indicative of a fall, the microcontroller processes the accelerometer data to confirm the occurrence of an accident. Once confirmed, the system activates an integrated alarm comprising visual (light) and auditory (sound) signals. These alarms are designed to penetrate low-visibility conditions, such as fog, rain, or darkness, ensuring that nearby individuals or emergency responders quickly locate the fallen vehicle. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective solution to enhance road safety for powered two-wheeler(PTW) users, potentially reducing response times and improving outcomes in accident scenarios. The implications of this system will make PTWs safer and inspire simplicity and modularity in their implementation in the PTW industry."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity in systematic literature review automation, and they are even acknowledged as second reviewers along humans by the Cochrane Handbook. In this study, we tested the performance of two LLMs in the title/abstract screening process in a systematic review on precision livestock farming costbenefit analyses. We assessed the screening accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models, as well as a human rater. We also compared the time and costs of completing the title/abstract screening by two human raters versus one human assisted by LLMs. LLMassisted screening required less time and money than two human raters, but it was also less accurate, resulting in extra work to rescreen discrepancies. Nevertheless, combining LLMs with the human ratings improved the quality of the screening output. Our results suggest that the tested LLMs are not as reliable as expert humans, however, they can assist in the title/abstract screening process and improve the quality of work with very low extra resources."

    "abstract": "In real world applications, image resolution is limited by acquisition constraints, resulting in blurred, low-detail results that prohibit correct interpretation. This project attempts to restore high-frequency details from such low-resolution inputs using a deep learning-based super-resolution algorithm. Although classic interpolation or CNN-based approaches try pixel-level precision, they tend to fail to reconstruct realistic textures and sharp structures. To address this, we use a super-resolution model with perceptual quality adversarial training that emphasizes visual realism over minimizing reconstruction error. This is also illustrated on a chosen image region of pixels, and it really leads to notable improvement in edge sharpness and texture coherence. Performance is measured quantitatively in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics with values of 31.09 dB and 0.8313 respectively and further confirmed in terms of visual comparison and pixel-wise error heatmaps. With emphasis laid on both qualitative and quantitative measures, this project demonstrates a successful approach to the problem of rendering high-resolution imagery from poor-quality data."

    "abstract": "Training a neural network for pixel based classification task using low resolution Landsat images is difficult as the size of the training data is usually small due to less number of available pixels that represent a single class without any mixing with other classes. Due to this scarcity of training data, neural network may not be able to attain expected level of accuracy. This limitation could be overcome using a generative network that aims to generate synthetic data having the same distribution as the sample data with which it is trained. In this work, we have proposed a methodology for improving the performance of ANN classifier to identify built-up pixels in the Landsat7 image with the help of developing a simple GAN architecture that could generate synthetic training pixels when trained using original set of sample built-up pixels. To ensure that the marginal and joint distributions of all the bands corresponding to the generated and original set of pixels are indistinguishable, non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and Ball Divergence based Equality of Distributions Test have been performed respectively. It has been observed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ANN model for built-up classification have continuously improved from 0.9331 to 0.9983 and 0.8277 to 0.9958 respectively, with the inclusion of generated sets of built-up pixels to the original one."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges from blurred boundaries and inter-patient anatomical variations, which significantly limit clinical applications. Traditional U-Net architectures, constrained by the local receptive fields of convolutional operations, fail to effectively model long-range dependencies and lack adaptive feature fusion strategies for diverse anatomical characteristics, resulting in low segmentation accuracy for small organs and large boundary localization errors. To address these issues, we propose DSM-UNet, a novel architecture integrating dual-path Swin Transformers and Mamua dlocks with cross-level skip connections. The network employs an innovative dual-branch synergy mechanism. the Swin branch captures gloval anatomical structural relationships through hierarchical window attention, while the Mamba branch dynamically models individual anatomical variations via selective state-space processing. Cross-level s.ip connections enable multi-scale feature complementarity, specifically enhancing boundary details and small-organ feature representation. Experimental results on the Synapse multi-organ abdominal dataset demonstrate that DSM-UNet achieves an average Dice score of $80.12 \\%$, outperforming the current model SwinUNet by $0.99 \\%$, with particularly significant improvements in organs susceptible to individual variations (e.g., gallbladder and left kidney). On the ACDC cardiac dataset, DSM-UNet attains an $88.47 \\%$ Dice score for myocardium segmentation, a $\\mathbf{2 . 8 5 \\%}$ improvement over SwinUNet, while maintaining comparable boundary distance error (HD). Ablation studies further validate that the Mamba module’s adaptability to individual variations and cross-level connections’ boundary refinement contribute $\\mathbf{1 . 2 \\%}$ and $\\mathbf{0 . 8 \\%}$ Dice improvements, respectively. In summary, DSM-UNet effectively balances global structural modeling and dynamic individual adaptability through the synergistic integration of Swin and Mamba, providing an efficient and robust solution for medical image segmentation challenges."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an architecture for high-level drone navigation with reinforcement learning (RL) while providing low-level stability via a pre-tuned proportional-integralderivative (PID) controller. In contrast to traditional navigation that uses only hand-crafted control policies, our method adopts deep reinforcement learning for planning waypoint-based trajectories and stability through Bayesian optimization (BO)tuned PID control. The framework integrates a model-free RL algorithm -proximal policy optimization (PPO) - to learn optimal navigation policies, where the BO-tuned PID controller is responsible for stabilizing thrust, roll, pitch, and yaw. Our approach is deployed in a 3D PyBullet simulation environment where the drone follows given waypoints and steers around obstacles. The hybrid RL-BO-tuned-PID method guarantees accurate tracking through RL’s adaptability and classical control’s robustness. By experimental verification, we show that our framework performs stable flight and efficient waypoint navigation and surpasses the RL-only baselineline methods in convergence rate, trajectory smoothness, and control stability. This work contributes to the field of autonomous aerial robotics by offering a systematic way of combining RL with BO-tuned PID control for improved drone navigation and stability in turbulent environments where altitude must be maintained and the drone should not drift away."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of cyberattacks demands more intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to identify or mitigate the effects of malicious activities in networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in many tasks, current approaches using zero-shot and few-shot classification have shown limited results for flow-based intrusion detection, with zero-shot yielding poor performance for the more complex attack types and few-shot exhibiting high variance. This paper introduces X-Flow, a two-stage explanation-guided approach that leverages LLM-generated explanations to enhance LLM-based network intrusion detection. X-Flow generates class-level natural language explanations from labeled data, which are then injected into the classification prompt of another LLM for real-time detection. Evaluated on the CIDDS-001 dataset across five LLMs, X-Flow improves macro F1-score over zero-shot classification, with substantial improvements across all the models, with gains of 12.9 to 39.2 points in the more competitive models GPT-4.1 and Gemma 27B. X-Flow also improves over few-shot classification in competitive models, achieving better F1-score, precision, and reduced variance, though gains are more modest. We find that smaller models with poor baseline performance show limited benefit from enriched prompts, suggesting they may require stronger interventions to acquire domain-specific knowledge from tabular IDS datasets. X-Flow also outperforms a recently proposed deep learning method explicitly trained on CIDDS-001 by up to 17.6 F1-score points. Our findings show that providing human-readable context in the prompt can effectively transfer knowledge from labeled IDS datasets, increasing the effectiveness and interpretability of LLMs in flow-based intrusion detection with a computational cost similar to that of few-shot prompting. We also release the generated explanations as a dataset to facilitate broader cybersecurity applications."

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly multimodal large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for addressing these critical safety issues. This paper presents the development of a lightweight embedded system designed to detect hazardous driving behaviors such as subtle drowsiness or mobile phone usage by drivers. The system leverages the Gemini API, an advanced multimodal LLM capable of realtime image analysis, enabling efficient and accurate detection of accident-prone behaviors without extensive local computing resources. Our proposed solution comprises three modules: continuous image capture of the driver, image analysis via Gemini API, and real-time auditory alerts triggered upon detection of risky behaviors. Initial evaluations demonstrate high accuracy, minimal latency, and robust performance under realistic conditions, validating our hypothesis that utilizing cloud-based multimodal LLMs significantly enhances the detection of driver distraction and fatigue. Future work includes adapting the system to mobile devices, utilizing smartphone front cameras, and exploring open-source models for cost-effective deployment."

    "abstract": "A key difficulty in solving multi-objective optimization problems is that multiple solutions may be considered optimal, without a clear criterion for selecting among them. Traditionally, this issue is resolved by involving a decision maker, a domain expert familiar with the task at hand. Their involvement results in an interactive optimization process, but one that cannot be automated efficiently. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose replacing the decision maker with a Large Language Model (LLM), which would be responsible for guiding the optimization in the appropriate direction. The goal of our work is thus to develop an LLM-based decision support system capable of assisting and directing a multiobjective Epsilon-constraint optimization procedure to identify the most suitable solution. Large language models represent a promising alternative to human expertise, as they possess a level of generalizable knowledge and human-like reasoning skills. In addition, they are capable of generating creative ideas, which can be particularly useful for tasks requiring the identification of connections between data points."

    "abstract": "Introns, as non-coding sequences in eukaryotic genes, play important roles in gene regulation and the maintenance of genome stability. Transposable elements (TEs), as the major components of repetitive genomic sequences, exert particularly important regulatory functions within introns. Although existing deep learning tools have made progress in TE classification, there is still a lack of models specifically designed for plant intronic TEs. To address this gap, this study proposes IntronTE, a deep learning classification model designed for plant intronic TEs. The model transforms DNA sequences into vector representations through k-mer embedding, and employs a hybrid architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a squeeze-and-excitation based on a residual network (SE-ResNet) module for hierarchical feature extraction. Within a multi-task learning framework, IntronTE simultaneously classifies TEs at both the order (4 classes) and the superfamily (16 classes) levels. Using five-fold cross-validation on a filtered dataset of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 2, 1 1 7}$</tex> TE sequences, IntronTE achieved average accuracies of 97.20 % at the order level and 96.25 % at the superfamily level. In independent tests on Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and soybean, the classification accuracy exceeded 90% across all species, with maize and soybean achieving over 97 % in both accuracy and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{F 1}$</tex>-score.

Any disruption, no matter how minor, to the 4G LTE networks we rely on—from total outages to subtle performance degradation—has a tangible impact. To address this urgency, our research launched a head-to-head comparison among four leading candidates: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and the unexpected champion, XGBoost. Interestingly, we decided to test them ‘naked’—directly against hourly KPI data from networks in Indonesia, rich in mobility and throughput metrics, without any ‘assistance’ such as SMOTE. The goal was to test their inherent robustness on imbalanced real-world data. And from the result, XGBoost emerged as the best performer: achieving an astonishing accuracy of 99.69% and a near-perfect F1 score of 99.85%. While Support Vector Machines also showed commendable strength (F1 98.04%), the other two competitors, KNN (96.25%) and Random Forest (96.51%), struggled, especially in distinguishing minority classes and producing too many false positives. The conclusion is crystal clear: In the face of the harsh class imbalance endemic to network data, XGBoost proves its fundamental superiority in classifying diverse anomalies. This is an algorithm that should be at the forefront of future mobile monitoring system design, allowing us to move from mere monitoring to true proactivity."

    "abstract": "Computation task offloading is crucial in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, especially for time-sensitive applications requiring decentralized decision-making and coordination among multiple edge servers. Most existing Deep Rinforcement Learning (DRL)-based offloading methods rely on value-based or policy-based algorithms under centralized frameworks or distributed settings that rarely explicitly address independent decision-making by edge devices. In particular, discrete Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) remains largely unexplored for IIoT task scheduling. This paper formulates distributed task scheduling as a partially observable Markov decision process, where each device independently makes offloading decisions to maximize long-term task completion while minimizing processing delay. Core system elements are mapped into state, action, and reward spaces. DSAC is applied to handle the discrete and uncertain environment. Experiments in a simulated IIoT setting with 5 edge servers and 20 devices show DSAC outperforms Proximal Policy Optimization method and the REINFORCE mehtod, and performs comparably to D3QN with a long short term memory component, which uses a more complex network. These results demonstrate DSAC’s efficiency and suitability for dynamic, decentralized IIoT task scheduling, making it a promising approach for future edge computing systems."

    "abstract": "The seafloor topography (ST) is essential for oceanographic research and geophysical applications, and its modeling relies on satellite altimetry-derived gravity data. The ST inversion commonly applies linear regression method that account primarily for shipborne bathymetry errors, while often neglecting the potential uncertainties in altimetry-derived gravity data. To address this question, we draw on the idea of total least squares, which has been widely applied in numerical analysis. In this study, we propose an improved linear regression framework for ST inversion: we use high-precision multibeam shipborne bathymetry data (MSB1) as a constraint to iteratively determine the optimal weight ratio between bathymetry and gravity data, and subsequently construct initial weight matrices; then the Robust Weighted Total Least Squares (RWTLS) method is applied to estimate regression parameters, and the corresponding ST model is constructed. A case study is conducted in a region of the South China Sea (113°∼118°E, 13°∼19°N). Comparisons with the check data (MSB2) and existing models (topo_27.1, ETOPO2022, and SDUST2023BCO) indicate that the overall accuracy of the constructed ST model is approximately 150 m. And compared with traditional method, the application of RWTLS improves ST inversion accuracy, with power spectral density analysis further revealing a significant enhancement in topographic energy within the 12∼30 km wavelengths. Moreover, we find that the improvement in ST accuracy is mainly concentrated in offshore waters; in these areas, altimetry-derived gravity data tend to have greater uncertainty, nevertheless, the improved method effectively enhances the reliability of ST modeling by jointly accounting for the errors in both bathymetry and gravity data. This study proposes a robust inversion framework that considers multi-source data uncertainties, offering a novel strategy for robust linear ST modeling."

    "abstract": "Large-scale distributed wireless networks provide infrastructure-free and cost-effective connectivity, supporting applications from disaster recovery to global digital inclusion. However, multi-hop communication introduces scalability challenges, as point-to-point (P2P) capacity decreases with the number of intermediate relays (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hop count</i>). The growth rate of the expected <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hop count</i> with network expansion is primarily governed by the underlying interaction patterns among network users. Thus, this study focuses on the critical role of multi-hop communication and user interaction probability, which empirical evidence shows it decays as a power law with geographic distance. We present a comprehensive analysis of network scalability, from capacity estimation to empirical evaluation of real-world interaction patterns. The capacity estimation problem is decomposed using a novel analytical methodology, along with symmetric topology selection and geometric partitioning, to overcome the complexities inherent in previous models. The estimated P2P capacity bounds, derived from <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">expected</i> hop count, surpass previous benchmarks. Specifically, when the power-law exponent exceeds a critical threshold, the expected hop count remains stable and P2P capacity is sustained; otherwise, the hop count grows and capacity declines as the network scales. Accordingly, an analytical method is devised to relate real-world interaction patterns to the power-law exponent, quantified by the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">contact distribution</i>. The analysis of multiple empirical datasets confirms that the exponent falls within a range that naturally supports <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">scalability</i>. Consequently, multi-hop communication does not fundamentally hinder the wide-scale deployment of distributed wireless networks. This capacity-based analysis provides a clear perspective on scalability under realistic interaction patterns and underscores the promising future of such networks, as well as their potential for widespread deployment."

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for instant messaging, securing group chats has become a critical concern. While cryptographic approaches are essential for this purpose, they typically require secure and efficient protocols for either group key agreement or group key distribution. Most existing solutions struggle to achieve efficient key updates and seamless integration with real-world systems. To address these limitations, we We present ChatKID, an identity-based group key distribution protocol. At the architectural level, ChatKID employs an asymmetric design to address the resource imbalance between the group owner and group members in group key distribution. At the technical level, it develops a novel polynomial-based key derivation method that drastically improves key update efficiency, while its compliance with the SM9 cryptographic standard enables easy integration with numerous systems. We provide formal analyses of correctness and security, including resilience against five common attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle, replay), and achieve forward and backward secrecy. Subsequently, we compare ChatKID with recent protocols and demonstrate its significant advantages in both storage and communication overhead. Notably, for group members—typically resource-constrained mobile devices—ChatKID reduces overhead by one to two orders of magnitude (i.e., to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1/10\\sim 1/100$</tex-math></inline-formula>) compared to others. Furthermore, we compare ChatKID with mainstream instant messaging applications and demonstrate advantages in terms of connection dependency, computational overhead, communication overhead, and storage requirements. Finally, simulation experiments indicate its superior performance in typical instant messaging scenarios. Taken together, these results suggest that ChatKID holds significant promise for advancing group key distribution in real-world instant messaging applications."

These systems will also benefit from the evolution of edge computing technologies through the availability of computing and storage capabilities that will span from the radio access network nodes to the cloud, forming an edge-to-cloud compute continuum. The availability of these features will provide the beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks with an increased flexibility for deploying the different AI/ML-based optimization functionalities, trading-off aspects such as delay requirements, computational complexity or availability of data for feeding the AI/ML models. In this context, this paper takes as a reference the evolved edge computing architecture of the VERGE project and presents a pipeline with the required functionalities for the lifecycle management of AI/ML models in edge-enabled B5G systems.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the event-triggered adaptive control problem with a global fixed-time prescribed performance function (PPF) for the thermoacoustic system with multiple acoustic modes and multiple time delays nonlinear flame response coupling characteristics. First of all, the acoustic model coupled with the flame response subject to multiple unknown time delays is presented to describe the general thermoacoustic systems. Subsequently, an adaptive controller is proposed within the fully actuated system (FAS) framework, thereby ensuring the stability of the thermoacoustic system. Next, by constructing a global fixed-time PPF, the dynamic constraint on the system output pressure is achieved, ensuring that its transient and steady-state performance indicators meet the design requirements. What's more, an event-triggered scheme (ETS) optimized in collaboration with the global fixed-time PPF is proposed, which significantly reduces the frequency of actuator actions and communication resource consumption while maintaining the system transient performance. Furthermore, the FAS architecture is employed to design the controller, which effectively avoids the non-differentiability issue of the virtual control at event-triggered instants. Finally, simulation studies verify the superior performance and practical feasibility of the proposed controllers."

    "abstract": "Falls pose a significant risk to the lives and independence of elderly individuals, raising widespread concern in public healthcare. Timely and accurate prediction of fall events prior to impact is essential for enabling effective interventions and minimizing potential injuries. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Graph Convolutional Network (Uni-GCN) that simultaneously performs skeleton-based pose prediction and fall detection within a multi-task learning framework. The proposed model captures both spatial and temporal dependencies in human motion through a shared graph-based encoder, followed by two task-specific decoders for future pose prediction and fall classification. A unified loss function is introduced to jointly train both tasks, combining prediction loss and classification loss in a mutually beneficial manner. Additionally, we employ a two-stage transfer learning approach to address the challenge of limited data in fall datasets, by pretraining the model on large-scale datasets and fine-tuning it on fall-specific data. Experimental results on public fall datasets Le2i, URFD, and UP-Fall demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.15%, 99.42%, and 99.96%, respectively. Notably, our system is capable of predicting fall events approximately 480 milliseconds before impact, enabling proactive response. In addition, we deploy our model on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super edge device, validating its real-time performance and feasibility for deployment in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "With the rising global cancer incidence, addressing cancer has become a major international priority. Efficient cancer treatment methods are in high demand. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is an effective targeted treatment for cancer. The tunable beam-shaping assembly significantly enhances the versatility of BNCT. In practical applications, measuring clinical parameters at the aperture is a complex and time-consuming task. However, measuring these parameters is necessary as they are more intuitive and ensure that treatment plans are set without errors compared to neutron energy spectra. In this work, we propose a method for predicting clinical parameters, such as advantage depths, defined as the depth at which the tumor-to-normal tissue dose ratio reaches unity, based on neutron energy spectra using backpropagation (BP) neural networks. It can quickly analyze neutron energy spectra within a short time. The models exhibit excellent convergence during the training process. Upon validation with the datasets, the predicted results closely match the calculations from PHITS. Moreover, when applied to actual beam-shaping assembly (BSA) designs, whether involving Li targets or Be targets, the models demonstrated high accuracy in their predictions. The time required for predictions using the models is instantaneous compared to the time needed for Monte Carlo simulations. This method can be combined with neutron energy spectrum detectors to develop specialized instruments for measuring clinical parameters in BNCT, paving the way for the wider adoption."

A physics-consistent RHS model is established, and the information-theoretic dispersion is derived in closed form using the Mellin transform method, we derive a closed-form probability density function of the RHS-induced channel gain. Then, we apply second-order Taylor expansion and saddle point approximation to obtain analytical expressions for the mutual information and unconditional information variance, which explicitly capture the amplitude-induced anisotropic variance. Finally, leveraging the Berry–Esseen theorem, the closed-form achievability and converse bounds are established which quantify the impact of RHS design parameters, blocklength <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>, and average error probability ϵ on the rate.

    "abstract": "Time series classification (TSC) is a fundamental task with widespread applications in scientific and industrial domains. Shapelets have emerged as powerful and interpretable features for TSC, enabling discriminative and human-understandable representations. In this work, we propose a novel event-based method for shapelet discovery that significantly reduces extraction time while preserving competitive classification performance. Unlike computationally intensive deep learning models, our approach does not require end-to-end training and leverages structural events in the data to efficiently identify informative subsequences. We validate our method on 47 univariate datasets from the UCR/UEA archive. Experimental results show that, despite slightly lower accuracy, our approach offers substantial gains in speed and simplicity, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications."

    "abstract": "In today’s world of interdependencies, hardware security is viewed as a crucial component in system designs and production. As Integrated circuits (ICs) become more complex with the globalization of the semiconductor supply chain, one of the significant threats to hardware security is the Hardware Trojans (HTs). Hardware Trojans are malicious alterations intentionally implanted into a circuit to compromise its performance, reliability or security. There are many Machine- Learning (ML) based hardware trojan detection techniques proposed over the years which yielded better results than traditional methods but they still continue to encounter challenges with ad-hoc feature selection, detection accuracy and black-box nature of machine learning models. The proposed work presents a comprehensive structure to detect HTs at the gate-level netlist using machine learning techniques based on Graph Learning (GL). To overcome constant feature engineering associated with structural features, the gate-level-netlist is converted into Data Flow Graph (DFG) from which structural and graph centrality measures are extracted along with functional features thereby considering heterogenous features to increase the detection accuracy and coverage. It provides efficient techniques to overcome ad-hoc feature selection by incorporating techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) where they also contribute towards the explainability of the blackbox model’s interpretations serving dual purpose. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is used as a classifier. The experimental results projected that the proposed SHAP based XGBoost model evaluated on combinational circuits from TrustHUB benchmarks achieves a remarkable accuracy of 99.16%."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of mass appraisal of market value. In the context of developed markets, numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of distinguishing, among all characteristics describing the object of valuation, those factors that are suitable for solving the classification task, while the remaining pricing factors are used to solve the regression task – namely, estimating the most probable price. Despite the demonstrated efficiency of this multi-model approach, there is no widely accepted methodology for separating descriptive features into classification and pricing categories. The aim of this study is to scientifically substantiate the effectiveness of decomposing features into classification and pricing groups through statistical analysis of expert assessments of feature importance. The hypothesis tested in this study suggests that features with high importance (as determined by mean, median, or mode) and high dispersion (i.e., a high coefficient of variation) should be treated as classification factors, whereas features with high importance and low dispersion should be treated as price-forming factors. Materials and Methods. Passenger vehicles are selected as the objects of valuation. The vehicle database used for developing mass appraisal models contained three million records. To assess the influence of various vehicle parameters on price, a survey was conducted among 18 experts – professional market participants. The mean, median, and mode of expert assessments were used to rank the importance of the factors, while variance and coefficient of variation were applied for feature decomposition. A variety of mass appraisal models were developed using both classical regression methods and machine learning techniques (gradient boosting, random forest, and artificial neural networks), with and without the separation of pricing factors. Results. The models that incorporated the separation of pricing factors demonstrated an average increase of 5–7% in the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) compared to models that used all features as a single set. Conclusion. The proposed approach to mass appraisal can be adapted to other types of valuation objects. The method based on statistical analysis of expert evaluations of feature importance is of a universal nature. This defines its practical significance, as appraisers and analysts in various domains often face substantial resource demands – time, computational, human, and financial – for constructing reliable mass appraisal models of market value."

The system is intended for real-time monitoring of environmental parameters relevant to maritime security, ecosystem protection, and the management of critical offshore infrastructure. Experimental trials demonstrated the device's capability to record variations in temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as to detect nearby objects and predefined acoustic signals associated with potentially hazardous scenarios. Comparative analysis against reference values highlighted a concordance of 93.6% for atmospheric measurements and 91.3% for acoustic detections, confirming the system's reliability under real operating conditions. The results validate the concept of a modular and autonomous buoy, offering practical applications for maritime monitoring and the prevention of critical events."

    "abstract": "Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to robustly interpret highly cluttered, and complex real-world images and scenes. To enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks."

    "abstract": "Congestion control (CC) is a critical technology for improving the performance of data center networks with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). Existing end-to-end CCs find appropriate congestion signals and calculate the congestion window size based on the Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (AIMD) model. Custom host protocol stacks and Inband Network Telemetry (INT) enable CCs to leverage congestion signals that reflect more comprehensive network status. However, these CCs still face a long time for draining up queues, link underutilization, and frequently tuning several hyperparameters. We attribute these issues to the limitations of the AIMD model and the reliance on time-varying congestion signals. An ideal CC should drain queues and fully utilize link capacity at each decision point. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel congestion control algorithm called FCC, which achieves per-flow fairness and efficiency within one control loop without tuning any hyperparameter. FCC collects per-hop flow information through INT, optimizes link utilization based on a fair bandwidth allocation model, and drains the queue by a time-invariant congestion signal. Our evaluations show that FCC reduces the flow completion time (FCT) of short flows by up to 86 %."
