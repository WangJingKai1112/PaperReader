    "abstract": "Oral health plays a critical role in the overall well-being of the elderly but remains under-addressed in many communities. This study evaluated oral health status and related factors among elderly residents in Guangzhou communities to guide targeted health interventions. Elderly participants were selected via convenience sampling, completing a demographic questionnaire and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). SPSS-based univariate and multiple regression analyses showed a low average GOHAI score (38.03 ± 10.21), indicating poor oral health. Univariate analysis suggested that education, chronic conditions, and oral hygiene practices significantly correlated with GOHAI (P &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that occupation and denture use independently influenced oral health (P &lt; 0.05). These findings highlight that the targeted behavioral interventions, particularly for less-educated individuals or denture wearers—could notably enhance elderly oral health."

    "abstract": "O cimento Portland (CP) é a pozolana mais utilizada como aglomerante para concreto, mas seu processo de fabricação requer altas temperaturas e queima de combustíveis fósseis, gerando alta emissão de gás carbônico, principal gás do efeito estufa. Para reduzir esse impacto, são estudados ligantes inorgânicos compostos por uma fonte de aluminossilicato, solução alcalina e resíduos industriais como substitutos do CP, chamados de geopolímeros. Sabe-se também que o consumo de água tem aumentado a cada ano e, consequentemente, o lodo proveniente da etapa de decantação do tratamento de água também cresce, dificultando seu descarte. A adição de lodo de estação de tratamento de água (LETA) em geopolímeros vem sendo gradualmente estudada. Nesse contexto, investigou-se o comportamento mecânico e físico do geopolímero à base de metacaulim e LETA. Assim, foram produzidos geopolímeros de metacaulim com diferentes quantidades de LETA e feitos testes de resistência à compressão e absorção de água, variando o tratamento térmico do lodo e do geopolímero. O maior valor de resistência à compressão alcançado para os geopolímeros com LETA ocorreu para amostras curadas em temperatura ambiente com 5% de substituição do metacaulim por lodo sem calcinação. Os valores de absorção de água foram próximos para todas as amostras de geopolímeros e superaram os valores obtidos para o cimento Portland."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a high gain and broadband transmitarray (TA) lens antenna transceiver for point-to-point high data rate terahertz (THz) wireless communication link. The THz transceiver employs a standard feed horn integrated with a 3D-printed bracket to enhance the gain and bandwidth of the TA lens antenna, where the TA lens antenna adopts a “sandwich” architecture composed of a V-shaped copper rotator, a dielectric substrate, and a grating. The resonant design of unit cells facilitates full phase control across 0 to 360° by polarization conversion at frequency between 0.20 to 0.26 THz. Experimental results indicate the fabricated TA lens antenna attains a peak gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture efficiency of 54.45% at 0.244 THz, with a 3-dB bandwidth exceeding 33 GHz. We successfully employed the TA lens antenna to a THz wireless communication experiment. We achieved a single-carrier modulation 100 Gbps data link at a symbol rate of 20 Gbaud for 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (32-QAM), and achieved a bit-error rate (BER) of 1.5 × 10⁻² without forward-error correction. This proposed TA lens antenna transceiver offers a high-gain, compact solution for achieving high data rate THz communications."

    "abstract": "Rub-impact of rotor-stator system is a common fault in rotating machinery, and its timely detection is crucial for ensuring system safety. Rub-impact fault induces rapid sinusoidal oscillations in the instantaneous frequency (IF) of vibration signal, making this time-varying characteristic a key indicator for detecting such fault. Recently, variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition (VNCMD) is recognized for its notable capability and adaptability in extracting rapidly oscillating IF. However, it fails to account for the inherent frequency-domain sparsity associated with such IF arising from rub-impact fault, thereby limiting its extraction accuracy and applicability, especially under high-noise conditions. To overcome this limitation, an innovative method, referred to as frequency-domain sparse constraint assisting variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition (F-VNCMD), is developed in this study. By incorporating a frequency-domain sparse constraint, F-VNCMD effectively leverages the sparsity prior of the rapidly oscillating IF arising from rub-impact fault. This integration assists the IF updating mechanism within VNCMD, which consequently enhances F-VNCMD’s ability to accurately extract rapidly oscillating IF while exhibiting strong robustness against noise interference. Additionally, a parameter selection strategy is presented to achieve optimal extraction accuracy. Both dynamic simulation and experimental validation demonstrate that F-VNCMD significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accurately extracting rapidly oscillating IF associated with rub-impact fault."

    "abstract": "Roundabout navigation presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to complex multi-vehicle interactions, highly dynamic and uncertain traffic patterns, and the requirement to coordinate with multiple vehicles simultaneously. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain safety and efficiency in uncertain vehicle behaviors and space-constrained situations, especially for mandatory lane changes and exit maneuvers. This paper presents a switched decision system that combines game theory and potential fields to enable robust navigation in roundabouts. The proposed approach first develops a Stackelberg game framework with uncertainty-aware prediction, where AVs dynamically adjust their decisions based on probabilistic estimates of surrounding vehicles' behaviors. Additionally, a hybrid potential field method is introduced that seamlessly transitions to emergency maneuvering when standard game-theoretic solutions become infeasible. Through extensive simulations under varied scenarios, the proposed approach achieves 97% successful navigation rates while maintaining collision rates below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline Nash equilibrium methods. The results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty characterization with strategic cooperation significantly improves the overall safety and efficiency of autonomous driving in roundabouts."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of tea tender bud detection, this paper proposes an improved Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) based detection framework. These challenges include the difficulty of extracting discriminative features for small targets, limited spatial modeling under complex natural backgrounds, and inaccurate localization caused by low-quality bounding boxes. Specifically, Cross Stage Partial Darknet (CSPDarknet) is adopted as the backbone network to enhance feature representation capability. Its original C2f modules are restructured by integrating a Dynamic Pyramidal Parallel Attention (DPPA) mechanism into the Bottleneck blocks, resulting in a lightweight C2f-DPPA module. The DPPA incorporates dynamic convolution layers that adaptively aggregate multiple kernels based on input content. This enables flexible and context-aware feature extraction across varying visual conditions.To address insufficient spatial awareness in the attention encoder, a Learnable Positional Encoding (LPE) mechanism is embedded into the AIFI module. This enhances the modeling of positional dependencies under diverse illumination and background patterns. Additionally, an improved Focaler-GIoU loss is introduced to alleviate regression bias in complex scenarios. It places greater emphasis on low-quality samples to enhance bounding box optimization.A self-constructed tea tender bud dataset containing 2500 annotated images was established for training and evaluation. This dataset incorporates diverse conditions including sunny, rainy, foggy, and overcast environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model, DPPADet-RT, achieves superior detection performance compared to mainstream algorithms on this dataset. It reaches 0.846 Precision, 0.847 mAP@0.5, and 0.366 mAP@0.5:0.95. Moreover, the model maintains a lightweight design with 15.2 million parameters and 34.5 GFLOPs. It achieves an average inference speed of 10 ms per image (100 FPS). These results validate the model’s effectiveness and robustness in real-world agricultural environments."

Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links serve as friendly jammers, simultaneously disrupting detection and maintaining connectivity with the base station. To maximize V2V links’ covert energy efficiency (CEE) and V2I links’ throughput under quality of service (QoS), communication covertness, and freshness constraints, a novel matching-based resource allocation framework is proposed. Specifically, we derive the minimum error detection rate and the optimal detection threshold at warden. The transmit probability and power are jointly optimized using the successive convex approximation method. Jamming selection is then modeled as a stable marriage problem, solved via the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable matching between V2V and V2I links. Additionally, we explore a coalition falsification strategy to further enhance the CEE of certain V2V links without hurting the performance of the rest. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, showing significant improvements over existing baselines."

In particular, planar Archimedean spirals exhibit curvature-driven alterations in domain dynamics and the giant magnetoimpedance (MI) effect, presenting opportunities for engineering tunable magnetic sensor responses. In this study, we fabricated Archimedean spiral sensors from amorphous FeCSi ribbons (70 μm width, 400 μm spacing) with turn numbers ranging from 1 to 9. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate a non-monotonic dependence of both the MI ratio and impedance resonance frequency on the number of spiral turns (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>), with maxima observed at <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> = 6.

This behavior is attributed to the interplay between geometry-induced anisotropy and demagnetizing effects, at which outer turns, characterized by larger radii and reduced curvature, develop pronounced shape anisotropy and enhanced transverse permeability, whereas increasing <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> intensifies demagnetization. Complementary three-dimensional finite-element simulations reveal spatially inhomogeneous induced transverse magnetization, with outer loops magnetizing more readily than inner loops except along the horizontal axis, demonstrating angular variations in the MI response. These findings indicate that deliberate optimization of spiral geometry enables tuning of MI sensitivity and operational frequency, facilitating the design of compact, ultra-sensitive magnetic sensors with customizable frequency and field response characteristics."

With the aid of sampled data and impulsive control, a distributed composed event-triggered mechanism (DCEM) without Zeno behavior is proposed to reduce the update time of the consensus controller. Impulsive control adjusts agent states at discrete triggering moments to reduce continuous energy consumption. Then, the pinning strategy is employed to control the agents with zero in-degree. Under the composed influence of the DCEM, impulsive control, and pinning control, all agents asymptotically achieve bipartite consensus. Finally, compared simulations are presented to testify to the efficiency and advantage of the proposed control strategy."

Long-term wireless experiments on POWDER evaluate the impact of network slicing and 5G quality of service identifiers on the network performance.

    "abstract": "Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL agents. The datasets, the code, and some experiment videos are publicly available at https://liralab.usc.edu/gabril."

    "abstract": "Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, trained decentralized policies based on normal-sized neural networks operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across two different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms. The Github repository of our code can be found at https://github.com/paulzyzy/YOLO-MARL."

Through an extensive review of the transportation literature, we construct a novel state space integrating local traffic information collected from surrounding vehicles and global traffic data obtained from roadside units (RSUs). We develop a reward function to guide judicious lane-change decisions, considering both ego vehicle performance and traffic flow enhancement. Our local density-aware multi-agent double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm facilitates effective cooperation among agents in executing lane-change maneuvers. Simulation results demonstrate MATRICS’ superior performance across metrics of traffic efficiency, driving safety, and driver comfort in comparison with a state-of-the-art MARL model."

    "abstract": "Dynamic loco-manipulation calls for effective whole-body control and contact-rich interactions with the object and the environment. Existing learning-based control synthesis relies on training low-level skill policies and explicitly switching with a high-level policy or a hand-designed finite state machine, leading to quasi-static behaviors. In contrast, dynamic tasks such as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an optimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal—a continuum of smooth motion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies (OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred sequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design hybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics and discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded exploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we present a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The proposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like soccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In soccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to contact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops. Leveraging the oracle’s abstraction, we solve each loco-manipulation task on robots with varying morphologies, including HECTOR V1, Berkeley Humanoid, Unitree G1, and H1, using the same reward definition and weights."

    "abstract": "Multi-robot localization is a crucial task for implementing multi-robot systems. Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless, characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently, long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable. In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

Although bipedal locomotion excels on challenging terrain, wheeled modes of transportation remain significantly more energy-efficient on flat surfaces. In this work, we develop a control system that enables a humanoid robot to achieve fast transportation - by riding a two-wheeled hoverboard - and robust heavy payload handling through whole-body grasping, where the robot uses its chest and arms to stabilize bulky objects. Our approach models payload-induced disturbances using a Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode extended with external forces and leverages tactile feedback from an integrated robotic skin to estimate the payload’s weight and center of mass. Feeding these estimates into the hoverboard controller reduces drift and enhances stability. Experimental evaluations on a full-sized real humanoid robot show that our system can withstand strong disturbances and autonomously navigate to deliver payloads of up to 20 kg."

    "abstract": "The unique optical characteristics of the underwater environment, such as light refraction and loss of salient features, pose a significant challenge to traditional vision sensors, especially in the swarm operation scenario where multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperate with the mother ship for positioning. To address these challenges, this study proposes the application of soft constraints on mirror position to improve the robustness of optical target positioning in shallow water. During the mapping phase, we establish and optimize the pose relationships between ArUco markers and their mirrors, thereby expanding the locatable space for AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) . With the arrangement of ArUco markers unchanged, the number of usable markers doubles. Surface mirror-assisted positioning provides more visual features and additional computed corner points, enhancing the reliability of camera observations and improving positioning accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to classical algorithms from the Artificial Vision Applications (A.V.A) laboratory, our method improves position accuracy by 25.8% in single-marker scenarios and by 14.7% in multi-marker scenarios. Therefore, our method provides enhanced mapping and positioning for AUVs in shallow water areas where optical markers can be deployed. This study provides a new mapping paradigm and multi-body localization solution for optical marker-guided underwater swarm operations."

Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts."

Typically, existing mechanisms require extra actuators or power sources only for tuning stiffness, resulting in additional energy consumption and more complex structures. To address this, our study introduces an innovative fishtail featuring an online stiffness modulation mechanism that does not require additional actuators or power sources solely for stiffness adjustment. Through model-based simulations and experimental testing, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the designed mechanism enables efficient swimming across a broader frequency range (0–4 Hz) compared to most servo-actuated platforms with adjustable stiffness reported in existing studies. The robot achieves a maximum average speed of 1.4 BL/s and a minimum cost of transport of 9.5 J/(m•kg)."

Bayesian parameter estimation is then employed to learn a probability distribution over the model’s parameters. This allows the uncertainty over the parameters to be propagated in the prediction of the end-effector’s trajectory. The model’s predictive capabilities are compared against the static Cosserat-rod-based model and the Kirchhoff model in simulation and are validated with experiments on a robotized medical endoscope."

Conventional methods offer limited improvement and struggle to maintain consistency, yielding deviations near 0.06° and 0.041°. By contrast, the IABC algorithm reduces these deviations to below 0.046° and around 0.038°, respectively.

We introduce HyPAQ, a hypergraph partitioning framework for efficient circuit cutting and distribution in multi-QPU environments. HyPAQ reduces inter-QPU communication and improves performance by optimizing partitioning for both static and adaptive circuits, leveraging segmentation and a codesign threading model, respectively. For static circuits, HyPAQ employs weighted hypergraph partitioning heuristics, dividing circuits into smaller subcircuits that balance computational load while minimizing communication costs. This approach extends to reduced hypergraph representations, enabling more efficient cuts in larger circuits and outperforming traditional bipartite methods. In adaptive circuits, where operations depend on intermediate measurements, HyPAQ introduces an assisted segmentation model capable of addressing runtime dynamics absent in static cases, ensuring scalable execution even in measurement-driven scenarios. Designed to integrate with a full-stack architecture, HyPAQ coordinates partitioning, execution, and resource allocation across multi-QPU systems. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in communication overhead and improved scalability, making HyPAQ a practical and adaptable solution for distributed quantum computing."

Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology provides new opportunities to enhance GNSS performance from a single intelligent vehicle by leveraging roadside GNSS (RSG) and C-V2X. Inspired by this, we propose an RSG-aided GNSS/LiDAR/IMU (RSG-GLIO) method to achieve reliable odometry and mapping, which leverages the high-quality double-differenced (DD) measurements provided by nearby RSG, effectively mitigating shared random errors such as multipath and NLOS. Our RSG-GLIO first estimates the absolute state of the vehicle using onboard sensors. Utilizing this initial positioning estimate, the proposed method introduces a coarse-to-fine selection scheme to identify consistent DD observations from available RSG measurements. Finally, the consistent roadside DD constraints are jointly optimized into factor graph optimization (FGO). Static and dynamic data are extensively evaluated using multiple RSG receivers deployed in the Hong Kong C-V2X testbed to evaluate the effectiveness of roadside-aided positioning. The results demonstrate a significant 36.6% improvement in terms of absolute positioning accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art GLIO method. Furthermore, we showcase the potential for employing RSG as low-cost base stations in dense urban areas. The data of our work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/DarrenWong/RSG-GLIO."

However, avoiding obstacles of SMs may conflict with the manipulator’s configuration, the planned trajectory for tracking control, and the target position for grasping. To coordinate configuration planning, tracking control, and target grasping in obstacle avoidance, this study proposes a hierarchical configuration planning framework with three levels: behavior planning, configuration planning, and shape/position control. At the behavior planning level, a Discrete Event System (DES)-based planner is designed to orchestrate mode transitions among obstacle avoidance, tracking control, and target grasping. The configuration planning level adopts the Bézier curve to model the SM backbone curve and constructs a repulsive potential field to quantify obstacle effects on the entire manipulator configuration. Under the constraints of grasping distance and material physical limit, the control points of the Bézier curve corresponding to the optimal configuration that minimizes the repulsive potential energy are computed. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving collision-free configuration planning for object grasping and placement in confined operational scenarios."

The agent is modeled using MyoSuite, a platform with realistic biomechanics where muscles drive skeletal movement. We observed that optimizing only the control policy is insufficient for handling heavy object grasping, highlighting the limitations of traditional control-focused approaches. To address this issue, we shift our focus to muscle development by optimizing the arm’s muscle parameters. However, this remains challenging for two main reasons. First, the high dimensionality of the muscle parameter space makes it difficult to find optimal designs. Second, evaluating new muscle configurations requires training a control policy, leading to high computational costs. To tackle these challenges, we adopt two strategies. First, we simplify the problem by optimizing only the stiffness parameters, as they have the greatest impact on grasping performance. Second, we apply the Bayesian Morphology Optimization Method (BMO) to efficiently search the parameter space. Compared to genetic algorithms(GA), BMO finds better solutions with fewer evaluations. Experimental results show that BMO achieves similar rewards with 20% fewer iterations than GA and improves the success rate by 10%. In summary, muscle optimization provides an effective solution for grasping tasks, and BMO demonstrates efficient, robust, and generalizable performance in optimizing muscle parameters for such tasks."

From the perspective of mechanical design in quadruped robots, an active spine with 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) can achieve dynamic posture adjustment similar to biological organisms which allows for pitch and yaw control. In this work, we present a novel approach to enhance the flexibility of a quadruped robot, Yatsen Lion II, by incorporating a 2-DOF active spine, which is mechanically designed as a linkage-driven parallelogram mechanism. To optimize its motion, we utilize nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which combines centroidal dynamics with full kinematics. By incorporating the two extra DOFs of the spinal joint into the generalized coordinates and velocities, we represent the robot as a hybrid dynamic system, capturing the intricate interplay between the legs and spine. Centroidal dynamics act as a crucial bridge between joint movements and the robot’s overall momentum, enabling the controller to synchronize the quadruped’s movements with dynamic spinal adjustments and adaptive gait patterns. We validate our approach through both simulation and real-world experiments. We compare spinal quadruped robot to their rigid-spine counterparts across key locomotion metrics, including in-place turning, straight-line speed, and turning radius. The results indicate that the spined quadrupedal robot outperforms its rigid counterpart by up to 26%, highlighting its flexibility."

However, the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to accurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects. Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip objects to a pose target within (±5 cm, ±45 degree) threshold in dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused, accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass (CoM) shift.

    "abstract": "Navigating unknown underwater environments is a significant challenge for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), especially those with torpedo-like shapes. Lacking a prior map, these vehicles rely on real-time sensor data for perception. Although online motion planning addresses this challenge, many existing methods are primarily tested on more maneuverable robots, such as multicopters and ground vehicles, and do not account for the unique kinematics of torpedo-shaped AUVs, such as limited lateral movement, or the need for 3D motion planning. In this paper, we propose an online motion planning system specifically designed for torpedo-shaped AUVs to navigate 3D underwater terrain without prior environmental knowledge. The system employs a receding horizon planning framework to ensure safe navigation by replanning the trajectory when collisions are detected or the planning horizon is reached. For trajectory generation, a search-based method is used and utilizes a 3D Dubins curve heuristic to guide the generation of an optimal 3D trajectory that adheres to the AUV’s kinematic constraints. To further enhance safety and smoothness, gradient-based optimization is applied to refine the trajectory. Experiments in simulated environments validate the proposed method, demonstrating its ability to generate safe trajectories for AUVs in complex and unknown environments.

Our goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on the robot. This observer builds on the system’s reduced-order dynamic model and utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force measurements during periodic wingbeats.

Current 3DGSSLAM approaches for dynamic environments often rely on optical flow estimation masks. However, these deep learning-based optical flow models are computationally intensive and limited by processing speed, posing challenges for deployment on mobile devices in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing systems depend on precise mask segmentation and corresponding loss functions for artifact removal, yet the pixel accuracy of optical flow estimation is constrained by real-world lighting conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a mobile-deployable Yolo and a mathematically derived Motion Probability (MP) attribute to label Gaussian points, which are then inversely mapped to the front-end feature tracking system to correct for dynamic object influences. By incorporating an MP-based penalty term, dynamic Gaussians corresponding to moving entities are explicitly removed to minimize their effect. Additionally, we design an edge warp loss based on MP estimation, enabling accurate artifact removal even with coarse segmentation masks. The experiments show that our approach notably improves the reconstruction quality of dynamic scenes, surpassing baseline methods and reaching speeds over 30 FPS on high-end GPUs, which suggests its potential for real-time use on mobile platforms after further optimization."

    "abstract": "Due to the significant effort required for data collection and annotation in 3D perception tasks, mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) has been widely studied to generate diverse training samples by mixing existing data. Among these methods, MixUp is a prominent approach that generates new samples by linearly combining two existing ones, using a mix ratio sampled from a β distribution. This simple yet powerful method has inspired numerous variations and applications in 2D and 3D data domains. Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar’s irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data."

Many studies based on hindsight experience replay (HER) and hindsight goal generation (HGG) have achieved the autonomous acquisition of robotic manipulation in reward-sparse environments and have greatly improved the learning efficiency of GCRL. However, these methods perform poorly in environments with obstacles and distant goals. In this paper, we propose hindsight goal diffusion and graph-based experience replay (HGD-GER) for complex robotic manipulation. First, obstacle-avoiding graphs in environments with obstacles are constructed, and the graph-based distance metric between different goals is established. Second, the proposed HGD approach utilizes the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion models and obstacle-avoiding graph-based distance to generate exploration goals, thereby promoting the exploration of obstacle-bypassing areas. Then, GER module modifies the reward value of experience replay by graph-based distance, thereby avoiding the bias introduced by HER and improving the learning performance of the RL algorithm under sparse reward conditions. Finally, we conducted experiments on three robotic manipulation tasks with obstacles and distant goals, and the results show that the proposed HGD-GER achieves excellent learning performance.

    "abstract": "Robots that use gestures in conjunction with speech can achieve more effective and natural communication with human teammates, however, not all robots have capable and dexterous arms. Augmented Reality technology has effectively enabled deictic gestures for morphologically limited robots in prior work, however, the design space of AR-facilitated iconic gestures remains under-explored. Moreover, existing work largely focuses on closed-world context, where all referents are known a priori. In this work, we present a human-subject study situated in an open-world context, and compare the task performance and subjective perception associated with three different iconic gesture designs (anthropomorphic, non-anthropomorphic, deictic-iconic) against previously studied abstract gesture design. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that deictic iconic gestures (in which a robot hand is shown pointing to a visualization of a target referent) outperforms all other gestures on all metrics – but that non-anthropomorphic iconic gestures (where a visualization of a target referent appears on its own) is overall most preferred by users. These results represent a significant step forward to enabling effective human-robot interactions in realistic large-scale open-world environments."

    "abstract": "Bipedal locomotion control is essential for humanoid robots to navigate complex, human-centric environments. While optimization-based control designs are popular for integrating sophisticated models of humanoid robots, they often require labor-intensive manual tuning. In this work, we address the challenges of parameter selection in bipedal locomotion control using DiffTune, a model-based autotuning method that leverages differential programming for efficient parameter learning. A major difficulty lies in balancing model fidelity with differentiability. We address this difficulty using a low-fidelity model for differentiability, enhanced by a Ground Reaction Force-and-Moment Network (GRFM-Net) to capture discrepancies between MPC commands and actual control effects. We validate the parameters learned by DiffTune with GRFM-Net in hardware experiments, which demonstrates the parameters’ optimality in a multi-objective setting compared with baseline parameters, reducing the total loss by up to 40.5% compared with the expert-tuned parameters. The results confirm the GRFM-Net’s effectiveness in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, improving the transferability of simulation-learned parameters to real hardware."

Additionally, a novel demonstration library update mechanism which learned from success allows it to generalize to previously failed tasks. We validate the framework in the Long-horizon Desktop Implicative Placement (LDIP) dataset across various baseline models, where Triple-S successfully executes 89% of tasks in both observable and partially observable scenarios. Experiments in both simulation and real-world robot settings further validated the effectiveness of Triple-S. Our code and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Ghbbbbb/Triple-S."

    "abstract": "Precise alignment of the micropipette tip is crucial for robotic cell micromanipulation, enabling delicate procedures such as cell transfer, rotation, and immobilization. However, due to the limited field of view and depth perception under high-magnification microscopy, it poses significant challenges in accurately identifying misalignment and effectively controlling micropipette motion for adjustment. This paper comprehensively analyzes and addresses the misalignment problem, particularly that caused by the improper inclination angle of the micropipette holder. A vision-guided robotic control strategy for automatic micropipette alignment is integrated into a 5-degree-of-freedom (5-DOF) micromanipulator, enabling autonomous detection, adjustment, and positioning of the micropipette. The proposed method ensures precise trajectory tracking and compensates for geometric uncertainties introduced by fabrication or installation errors. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed system achieved a mean absolute error below 3 µm for positioning the tip of the micropipette at the focal plane during the procedure of adjustment. Meanwhile, the robotic method required significantly less time to stably rotate the micropipette compared to manual operation for cell manipulation. The vertical alignment error was less than 3 µm along a 250 µm micropipette tip segment. These results confirm that the proposed approach significantly enhances speed, accuracy, and repeatability in micropipette-based micro-manipulation, providing a robust solution for high-throughput biological experiments and clinical applications."

    "abstract": "We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection–compromising safety and versatility–or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework’s capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars."

Frequent road crossings and heavy traffic loads often lead to congestion and lengthy travel times. Prioritizing emergency response vehicles in traffic systems is crucial for saving lives and ensuring public safety. Several approaches are suggested for integrating priority systems for ambulances, fire trucks, police vehicles, and the like. Another aspect of prioritizing vehicles is global energy and traffic savings, such as those achieved through public transportation (e.g., buses, taxis) or platoons (e.g., autonomous trucks). The suggested approaches preserve fairness among vehicles, such that vehicles with the same priority class are prioritized based on their travel starting time on a first-come, first-served basis. The results are efficient polynomial algorithms that respect the first-come, firstserved policy within each priority class and update the schedule to prioritize emergency vehicles as needed. Additionally, we introduce a practical method for testing dynamic traffic scheduling algorithms on real-world data, utilizing image processing in conjunction with GPS data within the SUMO traffic simulation software."

Micro/nano robots (MNRs), characterized by their controllable motion, present a promising solution to this challenge. However, the non-Newtonian nature of blood, with its high viscosity and blood cells’ interference, poses substantial limitations on the upstream efficiency of MNRs. This paper innovatively discusses for the first time the effects of blood viscosity and blood cell interference on the motion of MNRs, investigating their upstream motion capabilities in blood through comprehensive theoretical modeling, simulation, and experimental validation. A dynamic model of MNR motion was developed, and the velocity formula for MNRs in non-Newtonian fluid was derived. Experiments were conducted using different magnetic fields in pure water, high-viscosity simulated blood, and diluted blood. Results indicated that under a gradient magnetic field, the upstream velocities of MNRs in pure water, simulated blood, and diluted blood were 45.0, 14.4, and 11.1 mm/s, respectively. Under a rotating magnetic field, the velocities of vortex swarms were 825, 240, and 145 µm/s, respectively. Increased fluid viscosity reduced MNR velocity by 70%, while blood cells caused an additional 10% reduction. This research establishes a theoretical and experimental framework for the upstream motion of MNRs against blood flow, enhancing their potential in targeted drug delivery and broader biomedical applications."

Existing keyframe selection methods often struggle to capture high-level semantic information in environments where multiple semantic dimensions interact. In this paper, we propose the Multi-dimensional Semantic Analysis (MSA) module based on Visual-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the capability of VLMs to extract rich semantic features, we compute the similarity between each image frame and a set of textual descriptions, generating a scene descriptor that quantifies the semantic distance between frames across multiple dimensions (e.g., object count, texture, and lighting). We then introduce the Scene Change Assessment (SCA) module based on Bayesian On-line Changepoint Detection (BOCD), which identifies keyframes with significant semantic information gain, thereby reducing the total number of keyframes. Extensive experiments on an open dataset demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces the number of keyframes but also maintains high localization accuracy. Furthermore, the inference speed of the MSA module satisfies the real-time requirements of VSLAM. These results underscore the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of keyframe selection."

While recent advancements in human motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements. During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy, smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects.

However, for off-road scenes, freespace detection poses significant challenges due to the complexity of the scenes and the lack of clear edges. The existing methods have not effectively fused LiDAR data and camera images. In this paper, we propose a Pyramid Cross-Modal Feature Fusion Network (PCMF2-Net) for off-road freespace detection. The dense depth maps are concatenated with RGB images and used as input along with surface normal maps. The dual branch CNN-Transformer encoder combines convolutional neural networks and transformers to extract local and global features from RGBD images and surface normal maps, respectively. Then, in the pyramid cross-modal feature fusion module, the multi-scale and multimodal encoder features are fused in a top-down manner. In addition, we also use an edge segmentation task and a two-step training strategy to further improve performance. Experiments on the off-road freespace detection dataset (ORFD) demonstrate that the proposed PCMF2-Net achieves a competitive result of 93.9% IoU at a speed of 23 Hz."

The SAAS features proximal and distal soft balloon anchors, employing origami principles to achieve a 42.2% higher maximum expansion capability compared to conventional flat surface anchors. With real-time pressure feedback, the SAAS automatically anchors upon contact detection, ensuring precise anchoring without overinflation while adapting to colon diameter variations and robot posture changes. Experimental results show a tenfold reduction in displacement during the stability test, significantly enhancing the robot’s performance under external loads. Performance comparison tests in phantom further demonstrated notable improvements in the efficiency of colonoscopy procedures using the SAAS.

However, current rounded designs are constrained by a low sensing frequency (30–60 Hz) and the need for recalibration when adapting to new sensors due to the reliance on multi-channel captures, which hinders their performance in dynamic robotic tasks and large-scale deployment. In this work, we introduce R-Tac0, a low-cost rounded VBTS engineered for high-resolution and high-speed perception. The key innovation is a monochrome vision-based sensing principle: utilizing a black-and-white camera to capture the reflection properties of the compound rounded elastomer under monochromatic illumination. This single-channel imaging significantly reduces data volume and simplifies computational complexity, enabling 120 Hz tactile perception. A lightweight neural network can calibrate the sensor to achieve a depth reconstruction accuracy of 0.169 mm per pixel, while exhibiting surprisingly good transferability to new sensors. In experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of R-Tac0’s rounded design by evaluating its performance under different contact angles, its high-frequency perception in slip detection, and its effectiveness in robotic dynamic pose estimation."

Since their core function is to clean entire areas, robots inevitably encounter dead zones in cluttered and narrow scenarios. Existing planning methods often fail to escape due to complex environmental constraints, high-dimensional search spaces, and high difficulty maneuvers. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an embodied escaping model that leverages a reinforcement learning-based policy with an efficient action mask for dead zone escaping. To alleviate the issue of the sparse reward in training, we introduce a hybrid training policy that improves learning efficiency. In handling redundant and ineffective action options, we design a novel action representation to reshape the discrete action space with a uniform turning radius. Furthermore, we develop an action mask strategy to select valid actions quickly, balancing precision and efficiency. In real-world experiments, our robot is equipped with a Lidar, IMU, and two-wheel encoders. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across varying difficulty levels demonstrate that our robot can consistently escape from challenging dead zones.

Traditional methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian process to perform efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and its derivatives. We evaluate MagMatch in simulated and real-world experiments against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map, and robot-to-robot transformations—even without initial gravitational alignment."

    "abstract": "Scene graphs have emerged as a powerful tool for robots, providing a structured representation of spatial and semantic relationships for advanced task planning. Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance."

    "abstract": "Utilizing 2D images for place recognition within 3D point cloud maps presents significant challenges in autonomous driving applications, primarily due to the inherent cross-modal disparity between visual and LiDAR data. In this study, we propose a novel cross-modal visual-LiDAR place recognition method based on Bird’s Eye View (BEV) feature distillation. Our framework is the first end-to-end solution designed to achieve cross-modal place recognition between surround-view images and LiDAR point clouds. By encoding features into a unified BEV representation, our approach effectively bridges the modality gap between 3D and 2D data. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student distillation training strategy to further enhance the network’s cross-modal generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including nuScenes and Argoverse, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-modal place recognition tasks. Furthermore, validation on the SJTU-Sanya dataset confirms the robustness and adaptability of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Various components within a robot, such as mechanical systems, computational units, and sensors, consume energy, all powered by the battery unit. Each component features several actuators and individual controllers that optimize energy usage locally, often without regard to one another. In this paper, we highlight a significant phenomenon indicating a considerable dependency between the mechanical and computational parts of the robot as energy consumers and the battery state of charge (SOC) as the energy provider. We demonstrate that as the battery SOC fluctuates, the behavior of energy consumption also varies, necessitating a unified controller with awareness of this relationship. Motivated by this observation, we propose a battery-aware co-optimization strategy for the mechanical and computational units, leveraging configuration space exploration to optimize the motor speed and the CPU frequency under different environmental conditions and battery SOC levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extending the operational lifetime of a robot under varying battery SOC and workload conditions, enhancing the energy efficiency of a case study rover by up to 53.93% w.r.t. selected baselines and similar past approaches."

    "abstract": "As hosts to accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI), FPGA have shown great potential, supported by a burgeoning suite of accelerator synthesis tools. However, these tools currently target Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are known to be non-ideal for certain kinds of systems. Alternatives exist, such as Tangled Program Graphs (TPG), which are capable of adapting to the complexity of tasks including those where DNNs struggle. Even though TPGs have shown success on conventional sequential processing hardware, their synthesis onto FPGA remains unexplored. Therefore, we propose a new synthesis toolkit for automatically generating lightweight TPG classifiers which reformulate the TPG execution paradigm to enable streaming data and high levels of parallelism. When applied to practical classification problems including ECG arrhythmia classification and network intrusion detection, we enable classifiers which are $16.9 \\%$ more accurate, incur substantially lower resource costs and experience increased throughputs as high as $79.58 \\%$ in comparison to DNN implementations created using alternative synthesis toolkits. This realises an effective alternative to DNNs for deriving lightweight FPGA classifiers which are more accurate, cost less and deliver orders of magnitudes greater performance than current DNN-based alternatives."

    "abstract": "Tele-homecare has become a promising approach to meet the growing demand for elderly and disability care. In such a context, ensuring human-robot interaction safety during teleoperation poses a critical challenge. Existing teleoperation control approaches focus solely on the robot’s end-effector trajectory, failing to handle inevitable or even desirable contacts on other robot links. This paper proposes a teleoperated shared-control strategy to deal with this challenge. A lightweight exoskeleton is developed to teleoperate the robot and give force feedback to the operator. Additionally, an exoskeleton-based shared-control strategy is proposed to integrate operator commands with real-time proximity sensing information, allowing the robot to avoid collisions while executing tasks. To react to inevitable contact, the force feedback function is incorporated into the proposed strategy to enable the operator to experience intuitive contact. Comparative experiments and a demonstration are designed to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed strategy in a tele-homecare scenario. Compared to the traditional teleoperation strategy, the proposed method can greatly reduce the contact forces on the robot’s links, indicating the potential of the proposed strategy in advancing safety in tele-homecare systems."

During time-sensitive tasks, being able to fly over challenging terrain can also save time, instead of cautiously circumventing or slowly negotiating through. However, most off-road autonomy systems operate under the assumption that the vehicles are always on the ground and therefore limit operational speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach for in-air vehicle maneuver during high-speed off-road navigation. Based on a hybrid forward kinodynamic model using both physics principles and machine learning, our fixed-horizon, sampling-based motion planner ensures accurate vehicle landing poses and their derivatives within a short airborne time window using vehicle throttle and steering commands. We test our approach in extensive in-air experiments both indoors and outdoors, compare it against an error-driven control method, and demonstrate that precise and timely in-air vehicle maneuver is possible through existing ground vehicle controls."

Most of the tensegrity spherical robots deform themselves to make gravity work to realize the motion, but the deformation of both rods and ropes affects the robot's motion efficiency and motion instability. In this paper, a new type of tensegrity spherical robot is proposed, which is powered by six fixed ducted thrusters, and the thrust is provided to induce the robot to roll when in different attitudes. This paper firstly introduces the structural design and principle of the robot. Secondly analyzes the magnitude of the propulsive force required for the robot's motion and establishes a kinematic model. Finally, the robot prototype model was built and the robot motion experiments were conducted in simulation and the real environment respectively. The experimental results show that the robot has a simple structure but high motion efficiency, and has a strong ability to adapt to the environment."

Achieving efficient cooperation in the absence of communication has become a key bottleneck limiting the performance of multirobot systems. In this paper, we propose a Global Intent Prediction and Decomposition (GIPD) framework that enables robots to perform cooperative behavior without relying on communication. Each robot independently infers a globally consistent intent based solely on its local observations, ensuring implicit alignment across the system. Given the inferred global intent, robots autonomously determine their responsibilities and select the most appropriate tasks. They then base their local decision-making on the global intent, selected tasks, and individual observations, thereby facilitating effective execution and cooperation. We validate our approach using the MPE and SMAC benchmarks. Additionally, real-world experiments involving multiple ships demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed GIPD method."

    "abstract": "Underwater Object Detection (UOD) techniques are critical for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), which must operate in harsh underwater environments characterized by low visibility while satisfying the lightweight and real-time constraints required for vehicle-mounted systems. Current methods typically rely on underwater image enhancement combined with object detection to adapt to underwater conditions. However, these approaches mainly focus on the spatial domain, often overlooking the frequency-domain characteristics of the underwater environment. This oversight limits the removal of noise factors, such as scattering, blurring, distortion, and uneven illumination, and diminishes the focus of object edges and textures. Additionally, the increased parameter size and higher computational cost render them less suitable for real-time detection. To address these, the Wavelet-Based Frequency Decomposition and Aggregation Network (WFDA) was proposed, which leverages the Wavelet Transform (WT) to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components for effective feature modeling and fusion-based downsampling. Specifically, the Wavelet-Based Feature Decomposition Modeling (WDM) module utilized multi-level wavelet decomposition to hierarchically model features across different frequency bands, while the Wavelet-Based Feature Aggregation Downsampling (WAD) module refined and extracted core features through single-level wavelet decomposition combined with channel aggregation. Evaluations on four public datasets demonstrate that WFDA achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time, high-accuracy detection on robotic platforms.

    "abstract": "Lower limb exoskeletons and exosuits have shown promise in augmenting human physical capabilities, with applications ranging from rehabilitation to performance enhancement. Accurate evaluation of their impact on metabolic energy expenditure is crucial for optimizing design and control strategies. While experimental measurement of metabolic cost via indirect calorimetry provides direct assessment, it is often impractical outside laboratory settings. Computational models offer an alternative, but their effectiveness in predicting metabolic cost changes induced by assistive devices remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of incorporating different levels of complexity and sensory information, as well as various metabolic cost models, on estimating muscle metabolic cost during walking with a passive biarticular thigh exosuit. We compare three modeling approaches: joint-space dynamics, musculoskeletal simulation with effort minimization, and EMG-informed musculoskeletal simulation, each employing several metabolic models. Results show that EMG-informed musculoskeletal simulation, particularly using the Uchida (2016) metabolic model, provides the highest accuracy in predicting metabolic cost changes. Musculoskeletal simulation with effort minimization also shows promise, offering a viable alternative without the need for EMG data. These findings highlight the potential of computational models in evaluating and optimizing assistive devices."

Unfortunately, these approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks, achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>) to O(n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances.

A neural network is trained to mimic a state estimator, also providing information about the uncertainty of the estimate. This uncertainty is used to weigh the contribution of the estimate in taking actions for coordination. Using Control Barrier Functions and Control Lyapunov Functions, we define an optimization problem to find an optimal control input to reproduce collective motion observed in nature.

In this paper, we include a state-of-the-art machine learning approach for categorizing several lung diseases from Chest X-Ray (CXR) images, depending on a combination of features and several learning models. First, features are taken out of the data, and then, classification happens to complete the process. We include intensity, texture, geometric, and gradient-based features during the process of gathering important structural and disease-related information from lung tissues seen in CXR images. Using different types of features makes the model more precise in spotting different visual signs of different diseases. A two-stage ensemble model is applied for this task of classification. The initial stage relies on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to decide whether an image is normal or has a disease. Here, an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is applied to put the diseased samples under COVID-19, Tuberculosis, or Pneumonia. More than 16,000 CXR images from several opensource repositories were used for experimental evaluations. The suggestive system had an impressive score of 98.34 % in classification, better than many well-known models regarding precision, sensitivity, and F1-score. The research confirms that using several feature types and classifiers makes the detection of lung diseases both more accurate and reliable. It is helpful in making clinical decisions, mainly in places where radiologists are not available in large numbers."

Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controller’s energy consumption with a 0.06% energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61%. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints."

    "abstract": "Galloping is a common high-speed gait in both animals and quadrupedal robots, yet its energetic characteristics remain insufficiently explored. This study systematically analyzes a large number of possible galloping gaits by categorizing them based on the number of flight phases per stride and the phase relationships between the front and rear legs, following Hildebrand’s framework for asymmetrical gaits. Using the A1 quadrupedal robot from Unitree, we model galloping dynamics as a hybrid dynamical system and employ trajectory optimization (TO) to minimize the cost of transport (CoT) across a range of speeds. Our results reveal that rotary and transverse gallop footfall sequences exhibit no fundamental energetic difference, despite variations in body yaw and roll motion. However, the number of flight phases significantly impacts energy efficiency: galloping with no flight phases is optimal at lower speeds, whereas galloping with two flight phases minimizes energy consumption at higher speeds. We validate these findings using a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based controller, developed in our previous work, in Gazebo simulations. These insights advance the understanding of quadrupedal locomotion energetics and may inform future legged robot designs for adaptive, energy-efficient gait transitions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) Texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh’s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel’s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH Textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH Textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH Textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping).

    "abstract": "The recent development of foundation models for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is not straightforward, it can be costly and time-consuming because of the training and the creation of the dataset. The latter must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR or structure-from-motion with poses given by an IMU. This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sparse depth, of the camera-LiDAR calibration or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight enhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods, competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness than depth completion approaches.

    "abstract": "Localizing gas sources is a challenging task due to the complex nature of gas dispersion. Informative Path Planning (IPP) plays a crucial role in guiding robots to sample at high-information positions, thereby accelerating the estimation process. Existing probabilistic gas source localization methods often require robots to halt at sampling positions, averaging gas measurements over time. Consequently, when selecting the next sampling position, information gains are usually computed precisely through computationally heavy procedures, limiting evaluations to a small set of potential positions. In our previous work, we introduced a sense-in-motion strategy that eliminates the need for prolonged stops at sampling points, therefore allowing the incorporation of measurements taken during robot movement. Building upon this advancement, we propose to extend information gain evaluation in a more continuous manner, from a point evaluation to a path evaluation. However, existing IPP methods are too computationally expensive when transitioning from goal-based to region-based evaluations. To address this challenge, we first assess three lightweight information extraction metrics. Based on the selected metrics, we propose a novel IPP algorithm that computes cumulative information gain along the robot’s path and dynamically prioritizes exploration or exploitation based on the uncertainty of the source estimation. The proposed method is extensively evaluated through both high-fidelity simulations and physical experiments. Results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms a benchmark state-of-the-art method, achieving a 40% increase in source localization success rate and halving the experimental time in challenging environments."

As a result, air pollution has attracted more and more attention. Although there is a series of study of the relationship between transportation and air quality pollution, the research on highway transport at regional level is scarce. Therefore, based on the machine learning models, this paper discusses the spatial influence of highway transportation on air pollution in Anhui Province.Particularly, we take the highway mileage, freighthaul volume and passenger volume, as transportation indicator variable to establish the mathematical relationship with the level of air pollution indicated by the PM2.5 concentration value based on the Random Forest model. The panel data are composed of 16 prefecturelevel cities in Anhui Province (2017–2021) and the random forest algorithm is combined with spatial econometrics, in order to study the spatial distribution characteristic and air pollution change prediction with transportation.Random Forest is an ensemble learning approach which can identify the complex and nonlinear relationship and suitable for big high-dimensional data. As is the reported, the freight transport volume and road area of transportation activities have a high correlation with the fluctuation of PM2.5, and an excellent prediction performance of the model as indicated by an R squared of 0.89 is also found in our work. It may be of significance for the policymakers of Anhui Province to take notice of these facts.In this research machine learning is incorporated alongwith spatial econometrics in modeling the regional air pollution problem which creates practical perspective for applying region wise pollution control solutions. In further scope, the presented model can be extended to more regions and more pollutants."

Although hydropower flexibility can manage the stochasticity of renewable energy, the underlying bidding problem is complex due to intricate coupling constraints and nonlinear dynamics. A decomposition in both scenario and spatial dimensions is proposed, enabling the use of distributed optimization. The proposed distributed algorithm is eventually a heuristic due to non-convexities arising from the system's physical dynamics. To ensure a performance guarantee, trustworthy upper and lower bounds on the global optimum are derived, and a mathematical proof is provided to demonstrate their existence and validity. This approach reduces the average runtime by up to 35% compared to alternative distributed methods and by 57% compared to the centralized optimization. Moreover, it consistently delivers solutions, whereas both centralized and alternative distributed approaches fail as the size of the optimization problem grows."

    "abstract": "The accurate acquisition of fine-scale landslide information is critical for disaster early warning and prevention. However, existing landslide detection methods mainly focus on the spatial characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data, while often overlooking the cross-channel semantic dependencies inherent in their fusion. This limitation hinders the comprehensive characterization of landslides in complex environments, leading to insufficient recognition accuracy across different shapes and scales, and resulting in missed detections and false alarms. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Stream Coding Fusion Landslide Detection Network (DSCF-LDNet), which simultaneously models spatial features and cross-channel semantic dependencies in multi-source landslide remote sensing data, thereby enabling high-precision automatic landslide detection. Specifically, the spatial branch employs a multi-scale residual network to extract fine-grained spatial features, whereas the sequential branch integrates a multi-scale residual network with a long short-term memory module (MSRNet-LSTM) to model cross-channel correlations among multi-source features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module is designed to integrate both representations, generating more discriminative landslide features. In the decoding stage, an attention gating decoder module (AGDM) is designed to enhance multi-scale feature interactions, thereby improving the model’s sensitivity to landslide targets. Experiments on the self-constructed Bailong River Basin dataset demonstrate that DSCF-LDNet achieves a precision of 80.84%, recall of 77.89%, F1-score of 79.35%, and mIoU of 81.74%, surpassing benchmark models such as SCDUNet++, STUNet, and Attention-UNet. Tests on Landslide4Sense and Lanzhou Urban Area datasets further confirm the model’s robustness across diverse geological settings. Overall, DSCF-LDNet effectively learns both spatial features and inter-channel semantic dependencies from multi-source remote sensing data, enabling accurate landslide mapping for diverse shapes and scales, and provides a practical framework for large-scale landslide monitoring."

The inherent limitations of the 6G network constrain standalone task execution, necessitating offloading tasks to satellite networks. However, the open and highly dynamic nature of satellites presents significant challenges in designing an efficient offloading scheme while ensuring security. In this paper, we combine blockchain technology and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address above challenges. First, we propose a computation offloading framework for a blockchain-based terrestrial-multi-satellite network (BB-TMSN), where an offloading procedure under rigorous access control is designed to ensure secure offloading activities on the blockchain network. In particular, we develop a customized dynamic trust control and consensus mechanism to accommodate the topology between terrestrial devices and satellites. Then, the offloading process in BB-TMSN is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a DRL-based algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal offloading strategies. Finally, extensive simulations illustrate that our proposed algorithm can effectively address the computation offloading problem within BB-TMSN. The experiments, conducted across diverse network parameters and compared against various baseline algorithms, demonstrate superior performance in terms of convergence, efficiency, adaptability and security to different practical scenarios."

Reliable simulation models that reproduce the performance of existing experimental (U)WBG SBDs were established, and the simulation modeling successfully reproduced both forward and reverse operations. The physical characteristics of each (U)WBG SBD requiring further consideration were also examined. Transient analysis showed that reverse recovery effects were negligible in all SBDs. AC analysis enabled extraction of depletion capacitances, from which compact SPICE model parameters were derived. These SPICE models can facilitate system-level analysis and practical implementation."

    "abstract": "We propose a multiple-pass characterization method for birefringence in fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) based on optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR). A macroscopic fiber loop incorporating the measured FBG is embedded into a low-coherence distributed measurement scheme, and the linear accumulation and recovery of multiple-pass group delay (GD) in FBG are implemented. During the multiple-pass accumulation of GD, the ultraviolet (UV) induced birefringence in the FBG can be characterized by the asymmetry and shift of the multiple-pass GD, which is manifested as a novel concurrent differential comparison of different central wavelengths or effective indices under different polarization conditions. The proposed method enables several notable improvements, including enhanced measurement capability for weak gratings or microscale variation in FBG sensors, and increased wavelength stability and environmental resilience, attributable to the GD uncertainty reduction and self-referencing normalization of wavelength shift via mainlobe-to-sidelobe discontinuity in the multiple-pass GD. To calibrate the UV-induced birefringence results or verify the reliability, the stress-induced birefringence measurement is also performed by applying a known transverse load to the FBG, in which the experimental results agree well with the theoretical ones. The proposed method should be of significant importance for the research of laser- or stress-induced FBG birefringence and some other microscale behaviors in FBG which will facilitate the inscription and application of FBGs."

However, existing methods struggle to capture the full spectrum of facial textures, particularly fine-scale details, such as wrinkles and pores, due to limitations in multiscale representation. To address this challenge, we propose a self-supervised multiscale hierarchical network to hierarchically model fine geometric details in multiple scales in this study. We design a global and local Markov random field loss and a detail perception loss to provide a global and local sensory field of view guidance for retaining fine-scale detail structure information of the face. In addition, we introduce a learnable Gabor-aware texture enhancement module to enhance the network’s sensitivity to fine textures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can reconstruct fine-scale details of the face and has superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and visual effect."

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in assistive exoskeletons have highlighted their effectiveness in reducing the users’ metabolic consumption, providing functional compensation, and preventing biomechanical overloads. The exoskeletons’ transmission mechanisms are essential for guaranteeing their effectiveness, safety, and comfort. Therefore, lightweight, efficient, backdriveable, and minimally bulky reduction gearboxes with low mechanical output impedance have become a widespread choice in modular assistive exoskeletons. In previous works, the value of the cycloid-planetary series transmission has been assessed. However, the previous design turned out to be too bulky in the axial direction. In this paper, we propose a novel CYcloidal-PLanetary cOncentric series combination (CYPLO) that exploits a compact-cam cycloidal architecture nested inside the sun of a planetary stage. This design enables valuable performance regarding key gearbox features such as regularity, friction, and gear play, while maintaining an extremely advantageous compactness in the axial direction and significant backdriveability even for high transmission ratios. A reducer implementing this novel solution has been designed, developed through 3D printing, and examined experimentally to evaluate its performance with respect to the previous designs and state-of-the-art gearboxes employed in wearable devices’ actuators. The results show that this transmission architecture represents a valid solution for lightweight assistive exoskeletons, allowing for high reduction ratios while maintaining compactness and backdriveability."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a power-constrained optimal denial-of-service (DoS) attack schedule against transmission over interactive wireless sensor networks. A novel scenario is considered in which an attacker aims to attack the transmission links of the interactive networks to maximize the global error covariance with constrained energy budget. The attacker decides whether to launch an attack or not at each time slot. Two different cost functions are considered, i.e., terminal-error case and average-error case. Through decoupling analysis, the global error covariance can be separated into two portions: one part generated by the initial error, and the other by system noise. Based on this separation, the analytical solution for the terminalerror case is clearly derived. For the average-error case, the indices “<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">occurrence</i>” and “<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">concentration</i>” are introduced. These two indices are used to quantitatively describe the number of times a certain operator appears in a set of error terms generated by iteration, and the accumulative effect of attacks over a time scale, respectively. Aided by these two proposed indices, the optimal attack schedule for the average-error case is analytically derived. Additionally, a problem with regard to the maximization of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">occurrence</i> is proposed, whose result can be proved to share the same form as the optimal attack schedule for average-error case with measurement noise. Moreover, we have extended our theoretical results to those of distributed scenarios, which follow the similar temporal distributions of global ones. Numerical simulations, including comparison with the learning-based state-of-the-art method, have demonstrated the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed scheduling strategies."

    "abstract": "Event reasoning is to reason with events and certain inter-event relations. These cutting-edge techniques possess crucial and fundamental capabilities that underlie various applications. Large language models (LLMs) have made advances in event reasoning owing to their wealth of training. However, the LLMs commonly used today still do not consistently demonstrate proficiency in managing event reasoning as humans. This discrepancy arises from not explicitly modeling events and their relations and insufficient knowledge of event relations. In addition, the different reasoning paradigms of the LLMs are trained in an imbalanced way. In this paper, we propose WIZARDEVENT, to synthesize data from the unlabeled corpus with the proposed hybrid event-aware instruction tuning. Specifically, we first represent the events and their relation in a novel structure and then extract the knowledge from the raw text. Second, we introduce hybrid event reasoning paradigms with four reasoning formats. Lastly, we wrap our constructed WIZARDEVENT with the paradigms to create the instruction tuning dataset. We fine-tune the model with this enriched dataset, significantly improving the event reasoning. The performance of WIZARDEVENT is rigorously evaluated through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that WIZARDEVENT substantially outperforms baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our approach."

The aim of this work is to develop a bioinspired Artificial Hair Sensor (AHS) with a similar flat hair shaft using 3D-printing. The sensor was successfully manufactured using Digital Light Projection (DLP), a technique that allows multiple sensors to be 3D-printed in one batch, or arrays of them in a singular structure. The sensor is then sputter coated with platinum to add piezoresistive capabilities and allow the transduction of airflow velocities into voltage levels. The sensor has been characterized to show a sensing range between 6.8 m/s and 22.3 m/s and an average measurement error <1% under tested conditions. The upper range warrants further study as it was limited by the used experimental set-up. The sensor can be used for several applications covering robotics, biomedical engineering and meteorology, and the use of DLP allows for great customization capability."

This system includes completely different unmanned autonomous helicopters (UAHs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of actuator faults. First, a distributed prescribed-time observer is developed for followers to estimate the leader states, which can decrease the network flow. Then, an adaptive predefined-time fault-tolerant optimal formation controller is constructed to continuously optimize performance index and approach optimal formation tracking. Moreover, in the designed control framework, adaptive updating laws are constructed for the unknown parameters of actuator loss of efficiency and the lumped uncertainty, respectively. Compared with the relevant finite/fixed-time cooperative tracking works, here the settling time is independent of any existing control gains and the initial conditions of the studied heterogeneous multiagent systems (MASs), thus it can be uniformly prescribed. Finally, the control performance of the designed method is further illustrated by a simulation experiment."

In this way, geomatics brings together professionals with different backgrounds, who use specific examples from their own field of application to illustrate the use of tools in real situations. Within a university classroom, several disciplines coexist with the same tools provided by Geomatics, but with different levels of training in the use of these tools. The methodology consisted in designing a test to assess the ability developed by students to solve complex problems at different scales of analysis, and the impact on a training course involving geomatics in the use of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The didactic device is divided into four thematic areas: 1) cartography, 2) selection of tools to solve complex problems, 3) representation, and 4) visualization and interpretation. The test consisted of 12 questions designed to be answered by each student before and after a specialization course in geomatics, measuring in percentage the evolution in the acquisition of knowledge according to the aforementioned thematic areas. To certify the performance of the test, we compared the answers of two groups of students with similar socio-educational characteristics, in detail: complete undergraduate education, accredited master's degree entrance exam, equivalent age range between 25 and 35 years and enrolled in an Introduction to Remote Sensing course for postgraduate and specialization, respectively. The richness of comparing two study groups with similar characteristics of basic training allowed us to reveal the usefulness of the Multiscale Thinking Test (MTT), validate the use of PBL in classrooms that include geomatics, and to be able to identify the differences in the degree of depth that the training proposal has with the same topics."

O controlador opera em malha fechada, permitindo a seleção entre controle de torque e deslocamento, além da configuração de diferentes parâmetros como velocidade, direção e ganhos. Neste estudo é apresentado um trabalho comparativo entre resultados obtidos por meio do controlador desenvolvido e de um controlador comercial já consagrado no mercado (controlador de ensaios marca MOOG modelo STAC). Os resultados demonstraram que, apesar de apresentar um módulo de elasticidade inferior ao sistema comercial (1,48 N.m/° contra 2,39 N.m/°, em média), o controlador desenvolvido foi capaz de reproduzir os valores de torque de escoamento e ruptura, com variações inferiores a 5%, evidenciando sua viabilidade técnica para aplicações em ensaios de torção. Adicionalmente, o sistema foi testado em controle cíclico para que se pudesse melhor avaliar a influência da estimativa da posição por um filtro de Kalman no controle, o qual apresentou uma redução perceptível no ruído do sinal de controle"

The utilisation of data mining techniques facilitates the identification of aberrant behaviours and groups in a proactive manner, thereby mitigating potential risks in the context of teaching support. The present study provides an in-depth analysis of the correlation between relevant variables and mental health status, based on mental health assessment data from a university. This indicated a substantial correlation between college entrance examination satisfaction, primary help-seeking target, family atmosphere and students' mental health, thereby providing robust data support and practical reference for targeted mental health education in universities. The study established a correlation between students who reported lower levels of college entrance examination satisfaction and a higher prevalence of mental health issues. It was evident that students experiencing mental health challenges were more inclined to seek assistance and psychological counselling from their peers. Conversely, students with optimal mental health appeared to prioritise seeking support from their parents or other elders. Furthermore, students from dysfunctional families have an elevated risk of mental health problems. By analysing students' daily data, universities can identify key groups in need of attention in advance, improve the quality of mental health services and provide more targeted psychological support to students."

An LLM-aided Textual Semantic Integration module enhances features using facial action unit textual descriptions.

    "abstract": "In the current era of rapid-changing market and supply chain fluctuations, manufacturing industries face significant challenges in maintaining agility and resilience. Machinability evaluation is one of the critical steps in manufacturing planning to ensure the industry can respond to rapid market changes or customization demands. However, this process is currently conducted manually and highly relies on engineers’ knowledge and experience. This paper presents a systematic approach that employs fuzzy logic, which can be automated by a software program, for evaluating the machinability of product features and recommending reconfiguration options for computer numerical control (CNC) machines. This approach assesses each product feature against the current machine kinematics. The validated results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy logic can generate comprehensive results that reflect varying degrees of machinability. For product features that cannot be machined with the existing machine configurations, this approach identifies specific limitations and provides data-driven recommendations for reconfiguration. This will assist machine operators in making informed decisions, thereby reducing reliance on manual evaluation and planning. Furthermore, this automated evaluation process will enable a shorter turnaround time for new production line setups and enhance the overall operational efficiency, especially in high-variety, low-volume manufacturing environments."

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33% increase in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to enable human-like adaptability and dexterity."

    "abstract": "Mobile robots necessitate advanced natural language understanding capabilities to accurately identify locations and perform tasks such as package delivery. However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360° views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 56% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 91% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.

Thin films with different thicknesses ($\\mathbf{2 5 2 ~ n m}$ and $\\mathbf{4 2 0}$ nm) were obtained at deposition times of 6 and 10 minutes. AFM images were recorded at two different scan areas ($\\mathbf{3 0} \\boldsymbol{\\times} \\mathbf{3 0} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ and $\\mathbf{5} \\times \\mathbf{5} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{2}}$) to compare global and local surface features. The results revealed that at 252 nm thickness, the films exhibited a rough surface with an RMS roughness of 8.51 nm over the large area, while the smaller area demonstrated a lower RMS value of $\\mathbf{2. 4 3 ~ n m}$, indicating smoother local regions. For thicker films (420 nm), the RMS roughness decreased significantly to 3.687 nm (large area) and 2.540 nm (small area), showing enhanced surface smoothness and morphological stability. The observed trend indicates that increasing deposition time and film thickness leads to improved surface uniformity, which is crucial for reducing contact resistance and improving the performance of electronic devices."

As a result, they are able to move to higher levels of abstraction in system modeling and control. One such tool is poly topic modeling, which is taught in the postgraduate advanced control course. Its mathematical description can be intimidating for students at first, but we provide them with utilities that can be used even by students who cannot or do not want to delve into the mathematical depths. We provide these students with semi-finished models, e.g. a model of a linearized quarter vehicle, which they learn in a previous course. Here, the minimum requirement is to add nonlinear friction to the simple linearized quarter vehicle model and construct a poly topic model from the resulting more compact model, and use it to apply the simple pole placement learned in the state space description of linear systems. The advantage of the poly topic modeling presented in this paper is that it can be generated directly from the measurement data of a system."

This growing demand calls for educational programs that can rapidly cultivate human resources with advanced technical knowledge and industry-ready skills. In response, Okayama University, in collaboration with national and local industries, launched a dual-track intensive course on “Advanced Semiconductor Technologies” in 2024, following a pilot implementation in 2023. The program integrates expertise from both academia and industry, with lectures delivered by university faculty and professionals from semiconductor companies. Power electronics, as a representative application field of next-generation semiconductor devices, was incorporated into both the introductory and advanced courses, covering fundamentals, control methods, and state-of-the-art industrial applications. The assessment, based on post-lecture surveys of approximately 50 participants—including nearly 10 from industry—showed that 83% rated the lectures as satisfactory or higher, with particularly positive evaluations for sessions led by industry professionals. Qualitative feedback highlighted the clarity of explanations, the value of active Q&A, and mutual learning benefits for both students and corporate participants. These findings confirm the effectiveness of an industry-academia collaborative approach in linking theoretical foundations with practical expertise. Future improvements will focus on refining the scope of lecture content and enhancing opportunities for hands-on engagement, aiming to strengthen the program's impact on workforce preparedness in the advanced semiconductor sector."

    "abstract": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) links are a novel technology that complements radio-frequency connections or even replaces them depending on the context. These contexts have particular conditions that modify the link’s channel-impulse response (CIR). To test these channel effects or validate theoretical models, we need to implement the physical link, which can be difficult depending on the environment. Alternatives to in-site testing, replicating the channel effects in a laboratory setup, allow for quicker results that give us an initial idea on how the environment affects the link. We propose a work platform using software-defined radios (SDR), signal processing, and hardware-in-the-loop techniques that emulate the channel model through the transmission of a signal altered by the theoretical channel coefficients. The VLC link hardware, naïve to the channel emulator’s effects, performs as if it was in the environment. The system has been tested using a stream of digitally modulated symbols, estimating and recovering CIR curves close to the originals. Accurate emulation of a VLC channel using this platform facilitates extensive remote testing in diverse environments and channel models."

Several challenges, such as noise and artifacts, low contrast, and variations across imaging protocols, affect the effective analysis of images. This research evaluates the effectiveness of preprocessing and segmentation techniques in improving MRI image quality. Three preprocessing techniques have been applied to MRI images- Gaussian filtering, histogram equalization, and Denoising Convolutional Neural Networks (DnCNN). The results indicated that DnCNN surpasses the other two techniques, obtaining much- increased entropy and further noise reduction. Segmentation approaches were also made for comparison. The segmentation methods, including Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), thresholding, and K-Means clustering, are demonstrated with experimental results. The KMeans cluster gives the maximum entropy, proving to be the most appropriate segmentation technique. This study demonstrates the robust framework of DnCNN preprocessing and K-Means clustering to improve MRI image analysis with applications in medical diagnostics."

However, these devices operate under strict resource constraints, prioritizing operational-critical tasks (e.g., autonomous navigation) while handling image-processing workloads with minimal overhead. Offloading computation to a remote server can alleviate this burden, but unstable network conditions can degrade accuracy and timeliness. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel offloading framework that balances computational efficiency and accuracy in image-processing tasks. Specifically, it ensures (R1) a minimum accuracy level for individual image-processing tasks associated with different camera sensors and (R2) maximizes the overall image-processing accuracy across all sensors. Our approach builds on an edge-server collaborative image reconstruction architecture, where images are divided into patches and selectively reconstructed. To achieve R1 and R2, we introduce: (i) a hierarchical scheduler that effectively prioritizes patch transmissions under resource constraints and (ii) a feedback mechanism that adapts to network instability, ensuring reliable offloading and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework maintains high accuracy and timely processing, even under network failures."

This paper proposes an innovative method based on a hybrid Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, applied to a digital twin built from simulated historical data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on distributed physical sensors, our methodology relies exclusively on enriched SCADA data, modeled within a spatio-temporal and frequency framework. The IEEE-118 test system is used as the basis for building the digital twin, integrating characteristics such as voltage, load, generation, graph centrality, and frequency signatures extracted by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Realistic faults are injected (undervoltage, unbalance, topological overloads), and time series are coded to reflect typical daily variations. The GATv2 model captures structural interactions between nodes, while the LSTM encodes latent temporal memory. A multi-task loss function predicts both fault class and power imbalance intensity. Across over 10 simulated scenarios, the model achieves high performance (up to 96% recall and 83% precision), while maintaining robustness to noise and data incompleteness. The proposed approach stands out for its ability to operate without additional instrumentation, its scalability, and its interoperability with industrial simulation tools. It represents a significant advancement in the convergence of digital twins, AI, and graphs for the reliability of smart power infrastructures."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes DuLoc, a robust and accurate localization method that tightly couples LiDAR-inertial odometry with offline map-based localization, incorporating a constant-velocity motion model to mitigate outlier noise in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a LiDAR-based localization framework that seamlessly integrates a prior global map with dynamic real-time local maps, enabling robust localization in unbounded and changing environments. Extensive real-world experiments in ultra unbounded port that involve 2,856 hours of operational data across 32 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs) are conducted and reported in this study. The results attained demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art LiDAR localization systems in large-scale changing outdoor environments."

Also, a new perspective about visibility is provided in this paper that, via placing multiple obstacle-free safe regions along the human’s intended direction without any complex preprocessing for the point cloud, SCMPC prevents the robot from collision and occlusion simultaneously based on the basic properties of the convex set. The validity of the proposed method is comprehensively verified through real-world experiments."

    "abstract": "Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR) for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts. Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution images.

    "abstract": "Humanoid robot soccer presents several challenges, particularly in maintaining system stability during aggressive kicking motions while achieving precise ball trajectory control. Current solutions, whether traditional position-based control methods or reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, exhibit significant limitations. Model predictive control (MPC) is a prevalent approach for ordinary quadruped and biped robots. While MPC has demonstrated advantages in legged robots, existing studies often oversimplify the leg swing progress, relying merely on simple trajectory interpolation methods. This severely constrains the foot’s environmental interaction capability, hindering tasks such as ball kicking. This study innovatively adapts the spatial-temporal trajectory planning method, which has been successful in drone applications, to bipedal robotic systems. The proposed approach autonomously generates foot trajectories that satisfy constraints on target kicking position, velocity, and acceleration while simultaneously optimizing swing phase duration. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized trajectories closely mimic human kicking behavior, featuring a backswing motion. Simulation and hardware experiments confirm the algorithm’s efficiency, with trajectory planning times under 1 ms, and its reliability, achieving nearly 100 % task completion accuracy when the soccer goal is within the range of -90° to 90°."

The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments."

With the advent of computing technologies, like Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Computer Vision (CV), the detection and recovery process can be performed with precision. This article mainly provides a detail survey of typical skin diseases being detected by different ML/DL methodologies, starting from segmentation, classification, feature extraction, model selection to categorization. The reason behind choosing VGG-16 architecture under CNN, and the same captured images of skin diseases have also been executed through KNN and YOLO models are explicitly discussed with identifying their individual research gaps and challenges. The percentage of accuracy for all established models used by researchers are categorically reviewed in this article and also showcased in graphical representations."

    "abstract": "Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) algorithms can decode any moderate redundancy code of any structure, with integrated circuits demonstrating that it is possible to execute GRAND efficiently in hardware. By using GRAND as a component decoder, its remit has been extended to efficiently decode long, high redundancy product codes via the Iterative GRAND (IGRAND) algorithm in the hard detection setting. Here, by leveraging the property of even codebooks to split the noise effect search space into even and odd Hamming weights for the rows and columns in product code decoding, we demonstrate significant reductions in the number of queries IGRAND makes without any degradation in decoding performance. For IGRAND, we establish that the reduction in query numbers can be significantly higher than for the component code alone, resulting in significant efficiency gains. In particular, simulation results show that the average number of guesses reduces by a factor of 4 at a bit flip probability of $10^{-1.5}$ when the CRC $(64,53)^{2}$ codebook is used, without impacting on its decoding accuracy."

    "abstract": "With the rapid integration of robotics across diverse sectors, human interaction with these technologies is becoming inevitable. Ensuring safety is increasingly crucial to prevent injuries and maintain effective interactions. Accurate force estimation enables robots to sense contact forces and respond appropriately. This paper presents a vision-based estimation method for multi-contact physical human-robot interaction. Utilizing an RGB-D sensor, it detects 3D hand positions to identify contact points and employs a generalized momentum observer to distinguish joint torques from external wrenches. A long short-term memory network compensates for uncertainties arising from unmodelled dynamics. Addressing challenges like wrench null space and Jacobian singularities, the approach identifies computable external wrench components. The method achieves a 0.9 N estimation error in complex, multi-contact interactions, enhancing safety and responsiveness. Key contributions include a novel wrench identification method leveraging robot configuration and contact points, derived from a vision-based system, to enhance real-time estimation."

On the other hand, tourists face issues like barrier of language, missing contextual information at the site's heritage, lack of tour guides, or no human to guide them. They are also facing problems with AI integrating with IoT. This provides an opportunity to change the traditional experience of tourism into smart, auto-mated tourism. This paper refers to the design and realization of a portable AI-powered tour guiding technology that employs Unihiker DF Robot, Blues Wireless Notecard with Note Carrier, and headphones. The system uses OpenAI for spoken word communication, Google Geolocation API for data relevant to specific locations, and the buttons in the device itself for user's responses. We conducted field testing to calculate the functional integrity score which measured 92.4%. This high figure demonstrates remarkable performance in induction motors and generators, sound reproduction, and relevance of remarks made by AI.

To address these challenges, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that achieves physical dynamics invariance by directly optimizing force/torque inputs, eliminating the need for traditional intermediate control layers. Our architecture integrates a temporal trajectory encoder, which processes finite-horizon reference positions/velocities, with a latent dynamics encoder trained on historical state-action pairs to model platform-specific characteristics. Additionally, we introduce scale-aware dynamics randomization parameterized by the quadrotor’s arm length, enabling our approach to maintain stability across drones spanning from 30g to 2.1kg and outperform other DRL baselines by 85% in tracking accuracy. Extensive real-world validation of our approach on the Crazyflie 2.1 quadrotor, encompassing over 200 flights, demonstrates robust adaptation to wind, ground effects, and swinging payloads while achieving less than 0.05m RMSE at speeds up to 2.0 m/s. This work introduces a universal quadrotor control paradigm that compensates for dynamic discrepancies across varied conditions and scales, paving the way for more resilient aerial systems."

The simulation was carried out with OpenFoam, using the NavierStokes equations and considering the non-linear behavior of blood through a rheological model. The input data came from blood pressure sensors, while the oximeter acted as an auxiliary tool to validate the heart rate and oxygen saturation values. In addition to the simulation, an interactive web monitor was developed, implemented with Flask, HTML and CSS, capable of graphically displaying the simulated parameters and physiological signals in real time. The system operates without the need for an internet connection, which makes it suitable for environments with limited infrastructure. The results obtained were consistent with the expected physiological behavior of blood flow in a healthy adult, demonstrating the viability of the solution as a non-invasive clinical support tool.

In this paper, we propose DVEFormer – an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3FPS for the full model and 77.0FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications. Overall, our method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional segmentation approaches while enabling flexible natural-language querying and seamless integration into 3D mapping pipelines for mobile robotics."

    "abstract": "Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL."

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single vehicle’s limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches, leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities. In experiments on connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles and aerial-ground vehicles collaboration, our method improves driving safety by up to 20.7%, surpassing the best-existing baseline in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

    "abstract": "Time-optimal trajectory generation (TOTG) is critical in robotics applications to minimize travel time and increase robot task efficiency. To ensure the trajectory is feasible and executable by the robot, it is important to constrain the trajectory kinodynamics subject to the robot actuator limits. A typical actuator has multiple limits, 1) peak limit, and 2) multi-level continuous limits with different operation time windows. The peak limit bounds the instantaneous kinodynamics (IKD), whereas the continuous limits bound the system continuous kinodynamics (CKD). Existing works only constrain IKD, usually by the actuator peak limit, to achieve time optimality. However, a joint capable of operating at its peak limit momentarily will overheat and damage robot life if the motion continues. Alternatively, users can constrain the IKD with a reduced peak limit to avoid violating continuous limits. However, the reduced peak limit would inevitably sacrifice task efficiency. To address the challenge, this paper studies TOTG with both IKD and CKD, and proposes TOTG-C. It formulates the TOTG as a nonlinear programming (NLP). In particular, it proposes a novel formulation to encode the multi-level CKD constraints efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, TOTG-C is the first work that explicitly considers multi-level CKD constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed TOTG-C both in simulation and real robot experiments."

    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) shows promise in aligning robot behaviors with human preferences, but its success depends heavily on the accurate modeling of human preferences through reward models. Most methods adopt Markovian assumptions for preference modeling (PM), which overlook the temporal dependencies within robot behavior trajectories that impact human evaluations. While recent works have utilized sequence modeling to mitigate this by learning sequential non-Markovian rewards, they ignore the multimodal nature of robot trajectories, which consist of elements from two distinctive modalities: state and action. As a result, they often struggle to capture the complex interplay between these modalities that significantly shapes human preferences. In this paper, we propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach for PM by disentangling state and action modalities. We introduce a multimodal transformer network, named PrefMMT, which hierarchically leverages intra-modal temporal dependencies and inter-modal state-action interactions to capture complex preference patterns. Our experimental results demonstrate that PrefMMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PM and direct preference-based policy learning baselines on locomotion tasks from the D4RL benchmark and manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld benchmark.

During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem—which may require long-horizon history to manage failures—into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.

Uses of machine-learning and deep-learning algorithms are proliferating in nearly every industry, and while some are focused specifically on parking, real-time video analytics solutions can provide higher efficiencies in identifying and recognizing available parking spaces across larger subdivisions, thereby presenting potential innovations to address the challenges that unregulated on-street parking creates. The proposed framework integrates a low-complexity K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model for parking slot recognition with edgebased camera systems placed throughout urban cores. By utilizing edge devices and processing live video streams, less bandwidth/network dependency and lower latencies for availability and responsiveness are available when compared to a cloud-based streaming application. In the proposed system, a battery of background-subtraction algorithms is employed in conjunction with temporal filtering methods that can be utilized to improve reliability, thereby minimizing false positives due to partial occlusion, pedestrians, or lighting variabilities. To guarantee functionality and reliability of the AI models, the training has included a diverse library of datasets encompassing a variety of weather conditions, angles, and types of vehicles. After recognition, and the availability coordinates collected and transmitted via recognized and standardized low-latency Internet of Things middleware, the availability data confirmed for each parking slot is indexed and mapped in a centralized controller.

We also estimate decoding complexity and throughput, finding that Viterbi decoding for QTCM remains comparable to classical TCM/PCC (about $\\mathbf{1. 1 - 1. 2} \\times$ runtime overhead at $L \\leq 48$ in Python prototypes). The quantum advantage is most visible in intermediate noise regimes, where entanglement and memory preserve correlations useful for decoding, and it is maintained over a broad operating range before converging to the fully mixed limit.

In network-controlled manipulators, when control commands sent from the control center to the remote manipulator are subject to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), serious incidents and potential harm to individuals can occur. This paper proposes a novel resilient controller such that the manipulator can successfully complete motion tracking tasks and address the non-repetitive motion problem, even in the presence of FDIAs. The problem is first reformulated as a convex optimization problem with an unknown parameter relative to FDIAs, where the RMC criteria serves as the objective function and physical limitations are incorporated as inequality constraints. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is then introduced to solve the problem, improving computational efficiency. Additionally, a detection mechanism is integrated to estimate the unknown attack parameter, allowing the RNN to find the optimal control command. Simulations and experiments are conducted on an RM65-B manipulator to validate the efficacy of the proposed method, and comparisons with existing approaches highlight its superior performance."

To tackle these challenges, we propose MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically, MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges.

    "abstract": "Embodied Question Answering (EQA) is an essential yet challenging task for robot assistants. Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for EQA, but existing approaches either treat it as static video question answering without active exploration or restrict answers to a closed set of choices. These limitations hinder real-world applicability, where a robot must explore efficiently and provide accurate answers in open-vocabulary settings. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EfficientEQA, a novel framework that couples efficient exploration with free-form answer generation. EfficientEQA features three key innovations: (1) Semantic-Value-Weighted Frontier Exploration (SFE) with Verbalized Confidence (VC) from a black-box VLM to prioritize semantically important areas to explore, enabling the agent to gather relevant information faster; (2) a BLIP relevancy-based mechanism to stop adaptively by flagging highly relevant observations as outliers to indicate whether the agent has collected enough information; and (3) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for the VLM to answer accurately based on pertinent images from the agent’s observation history without relying on predefined choices. Our experimental results show that EfficientEQA achieves over 15% higher answer accuracy and requires over 20% fewer exploration steps than state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning has emerged as an effective paradigm for training visuo-motor policies in robotic manipulation. In real-world scenarios, visuo-motor policies are required to be effective, sample-efficient, and capable of adapting to dynamic environments. A key factor influencing these capabilities is the quality of visual representations. Conventional approaches that learn a vision encoder and policy network from scratch often result in suboptimal representations, as the training process tends to prioritize policy optimization over rich semantic feature extraction. Alternatively, while pre-trained large vision models offer strong general-purpose features, they often fail to capture the fine-grained, task-specific information required for effective manipulation. To capture rich and informative visual features, we propose TOC-DP, a novel framework that integrates SlotAttention to facilitate object-centric representation learning. Task-specific segmentation priors are incorporated as an inductive bias to enhance the task-awareness and object-awareness of the learned visual features. The extracted representations are subsequently refined to encode action-aware information during downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that TOC-DP achieves a 30% improvement in success rate over baseline methods during deployment for a variety of scenarios."

Previous methods focus on simplified and limited manipulation tasks, which often neglect the complexities associated with grasping a diverse array of objects in a long-horizon manner. In contrast, our proposed framework utilizes a dexterous hand capable of grasping objects of varying shapes and sizes while executing tasks based on natural language commands. The proposed approach has the following core components: First, a robust task planner with a task-level recovery mechanism that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) is designed, which enables the system to interpret and execute open-vocabulary commands for long sequence tasks. Second, a language-guided dexterous grasp perception algorithm is presented based on robot kinematics and formal methods, tailored for zero-shot dexterous manipulation with diverse objects and commands. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of RoboDexVLM in handling long-horizon scenarios and performing dexterous grasping.

This study presents an integrated approach to detect and monitor total snow cover and wet snow dynamics in the Lileo basin (Neuquén Province, Argentina) using Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. By combining total and wet snow maps, we identified active melt areas and linked them to streamflow variations, offering a first approximation to runoff forecasting in a data-scarce mountain environment. A comparative analysis of the 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 hydrological years revealed contrasting responses: the first reflected a typical nival regime with delayed and limited snowmelt-driven runoff, whereas the second exhibited a pluvio-nival pattern driven by early rainfall and more efficient melt, resulting in higher discharge. These findings confirm that the integration of optical and SAR observations not only enable robust snow quantification under diverse climatic conditions but also provides insights into seasonal hydrological regimes, thereby enhancing the capacity for informed water resource management in mountain basins."

    "abstract": "Robots rely heavily on visual perception to understand and interact with complex environments. To support this capability, modern perception models have become increasingly large and powerful, resulting in high computational costs that hinder their real-time performance in robotic applications. Existing acceleration techniques, such as model pruning and token pruning, focus on reducing architectural or parameter redundancy but still process all object categories, regardless of task requirements. However, in real-world robotic scenarios, different tasks typically require only a subset of object categories. For instance, a service robot may focus on kitchenware while cooking, but shift to furniture and obstacles while cleaning. This task-dependent variation creates opportunities to reduce computational cost by selectively processing relevant information. Existing methods are not designed to exploit this potential for task-specific efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose TaskTP, a task-oriented token pruning method that dynamically adjusts token pruning based on the target category set. A dynamic gating network is introduced between successive Transformer blocks, which evaluates the relevance of each token to the given task. TaskTP allows for more aggressive pruning when fewer categories are required, optimizing computation without sacrificing performance. After a task-agnostic training phase, it can be flexibly configured at deployment time to support any category subset without retraining, making it both efficient and versatile. TaskTP improves the performance of Mask R-CNN from 31.4 fps to 38.5 fps on the COCO dataset. Furthermore, on the ScanNet dataset, where an object search task was defined to simulate real-world robotic applications, processing time was reduced from 3197 ms to 2437 ms, demonstrating significant efficiency gains."

Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision tasks - whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control, deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for Motion Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination (available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack). The method is validated by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs, evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external disturbances."

We further demonstrate reversible cyclic actuation via controlled swelling-deswelling using ethanol-water solutions. Finally, we integrate these systems into a shape-morphing wheel design to enable adaptive locomotion that passively transitions between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Our findings demonstrate SAP-based osmotic actuators as an environmentally-driven solution for soft robotics, and shape-shifting soft hybrid mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Robot learning has produced remarkably effective \"black-box\" controllers for complex tasks such as dynamic locomotion on humanoids. Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception."

    "abstract": "Micropuncture is a critical step in drug injection during retinal vein cannulation (RVC) surgery. Minimizing deformation during the micropuncture process is beneficial to reduce mechanical damage. However, this goal is challenging due to the viscoelastic characteristics of retinal tissue. In this paper, a robotic micropuncture scheme for deformation optimization that incorporates a nonlinear force model is proposed. Before micropuncture, a preload strategy is utilized to ensure stable contact between needle and retinal vein. Secondly, a nonlinear viscoelastic (NV) model is developed to characterize the nonlinearity and relaxation behavior of the tissue. Finally, a speed optimization framework, based on the NV model and physical constraint, is adopted to minimize deformation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through in vitro experiments conducted on open-sky porcine eyes. With average force error of 1.48 μN, stable contact can be achieved via proportion-integral-differential controller. The experimental results demonstrate that the NV model is more suitable for force modeling of retinal tissue. Furthermore, the optimized speed results in an average deformation of 0.5727 mm, which represents a reduction of at least 21.02% compared to the linear model. Thanks to the proposed scheme, the robotic micropuncture based on a varying speed trajectory can reduce deformation and enhance the safety of RVC surgery."

In this study, we explore how machine learning can help predict such failures before they happen. Network performance data from a mobile network operator in Nigeria was collected, cleaned and used to achieve the purpose of the study. Four algorithms belonging to machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) were adopted and used for training the dataset and predicting link failures. Results show that the Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM - a deep learning model effective for handling time-series data) performed best with prediction accuracy of 92%, distantly followed by others. These findings indicate that the LSTM is better in modelling temporal patterns in network behaviours. This study provides a practical framework for automating microwave link monitoring and maintenance, thereby reducing manual diagnostics, preventing outages, and improving service reliability.

Although existing studies have addressed isolated subproblems like shape tracking, grasping, and shape control, there has been limited exploration of integrated workflows that combine these individual processes.To address this gap, we propose an object-centric perception and planning framework to achieve a comprehensive DLO assembly process throughout the industrial value chain. The framework utilizes visual and tactile information to track the DLO’s shape as well as contact state across different stages, which facilitates effective planning of robot actions. Our approach encompasses robot-based bin picking of DLOs from cluttered environments, followed by a coordinated handover to two additional robots that mount the DLOs onto designated fixtures.

    "abstract": "Generalizable algorithms for tactile sensing remain underexplored, primarily due to the diversity of sensor modalities. Recently, many methods for cross-sensor transfer between optical (vision-based) tactile sensors have been investigated, yet little work focus on non-optical tactile sensors. To address this gap, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture to unify tactile data across non-vision-based sensors. By leveraging sensor-specific encoders, the framework creates a latent space that is sensor-agnostic, enabling cross-sensor data transfer with low errors and direct use in downstream applications. We leverage this network to unify tactile data from two commercial tactile sensors: the Xela uSkin uSPa 46 and the Contactile PapillArray. Both were mounted on a UR5e robotic arm, performing force-controlled pressing sequences against distinct object shapes (circular, square, and hexagonal prisms) and two materials (rigid PLA and flexible TPU). Another more complex unseen object was also included to investigate the model’s generalization capabilities. We show that alignment in latent space can be implicitly learned from joint autoencoder training with matching contacts collected via different sensors. We further demonstrate the practical utility of our approach through contact geometry estimation, where downstream models trained on one sensor’s latent representation can be directly applied to another without retraining."

The proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world validations further confirm the framework’s ability to navigate safely and effectively in dynamic industrial settings.

    "abstract": "Integrating functional wrist articulation in prosthetic robot arms is crucial for enhancing natural movement and reducing compensatory upper limb motions. However, two significant challenges remain in electromyography (sEMG)-based prosthetic control: (1) real-time processing via efficient model design and (2) cross-subject generalization to address the individual variability in muscle signals. This study employs the MAMBA2 architecture to address the first challenge, leveraging Structured State Space Models (SSM) for efficient long-sequence inference. This enables real-time control with minimal computational overhead, making it well-suited for prosthetic robot arm applications. To tackle the second challenge, we implement a Representation Subspace Distance (RSD)-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), which preserves feature scale while aligning inter-subject variations, mitigating domain shift effects, and improving subject-independent wrist movement estimation. The model is trained on the Ninapro DB2 dataset, utilizing multi-channel sEMG signals and corresponding wrist kinematics. Evaluation results demonstrate that the MAMBA architecture outperforms conventional recurrent neural networks, achieving lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and higher R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values, with the Attention variant exhibiting the best prediction performance. Furthermore, this study highlights that the proposed UDA approach, combined with RSD-based alignment, significantly enhances cross-subject performance, reducing the need for extensive calibration. By enabling real-time processing through a computationally efficient model structure and effectively addressing cross-subject variability, this study contributes to developing a more reliable and generalizable sEMG-based robotic prosthesis controller, ultimately improving its applicability across diverse individuals."

    "abstract": "Traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in modern urban networks. Autonomous driving technologies have emerged as a potential solution. Among traffic control methods, reinforcement learning has shown superior performance over traffic signals in various scenarios. However, prior research has largely focused on small-scale networks or isolated intersections, leaving large-scale mixed traffic control largely unexplored. This study presents the first attempt to use decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning for large-scale mixed traffic control in which some intersections are managed by traffic signals and others by robot vehicles. Evaluating a real-world network in Colorado Springs, CO, USA with 14 intersections, we measure traffic efficiency via average waiting time of vehicles at intersections and the number of vehicles reaching their destinations within a time window (i.e., throughput). At 80% RV penetration rate, our method reduces waiting time from 6.17 s to 5.09 s and increases throughput from 454 vehicles per 500 seconds to 493 vehicles per 500 seconds, outperforming the baseline of fully signalized intersections. These findings suggest that integrating reinforcement learning-based control large-scale traffic can improve overall efficiency and may inform future urban planning strategies."

Accurate registration of partially overlapped intraoperative point clouds (e.g., femoral reconstruction) remains critical yet challenging in orthopedic navigation due to incomplete overlap and dynamic noise. In this study, we propose a partial-to-partial point cloud registration framework based on directional spatial consistency. First, we extract overlapped areas from partially overlapping point clouds and leverage the point registration graph matching module to calculate the hard point matching matrix. Second, we sample nodes from the source point cloud and generate translation-invariant edge vectors (direction/scale-preserving) via their k-nearest neighbors, guided by predicted point correspondences. This bypasses translation ambiguities by encoding spatial consistency through edges, reducing pose estimation to 3DoF alignment (rotation). The loss explicitly couples point-level matches with edge-level geometric constraints for dual optimization. Building upon this framework, we extract reliable overlapping edge representations and prune their similarity matrix by thresholding low-confidence scores, effectively suppressing spurious matches. The proposed edge-aware matching mechanism further exploits the translation invariance of local structures to refine point correspondences with enhanced accuracy. Finally, we introduce a bidirectional registration mechanism to reinforce optimization stability, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and MedShapeNet validate our method under diverse scenarios: partial-to-partial, unseen categories, partial-to-full, and cross-dataset generalization, surpassing existing methods in registration accuracy.

To tackle the complicated issue, we hereby introduce the multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV or UAVs) system to monitor the multi-USV system. Therein, by introducing a sparse-Bayesian-learning-based (SBL-based) algorithm, the multi-UAV system can identify the potential coordinated dynamics of multi-USV system via only noisy and limited data. Then, by employing the Kalman filter (KF), the proposed approach can predict and update real-time data and optimize trajectory estimation for USVs, and enhance coordination control in the multi-UAV system to achieve coordinated monitoring. Finally, comparative simulations against the traditional control method, conducted under varying noise levels and data availability ratios, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

Over the past decades, machine learning (ML) has been a game-changing technique for better brain stroke prediction, enabling more precise identification of people at risk. This study compares different ML techniques to predict the occurrence of these strokes on performance evaluation indicators, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall, so that the underpinning models produce meaningful and feasible predictions.

    "abstract": "Bone drilling is a critical component of many clinical surgeries. In robot-assisted deep bone drilling procedures, the complex structure of bone tissue and individual variations in drilling paths often cause slender tools to skid on personalized bone surfaces, leading to deviations that significantly impact surgical precision and safety. This paper presents the development of an orthopedic surgical robot equipped with skidding sensing capabilities. A novel sensing solution for the bone drilling unit is proposed, which employs rigid body force transmission and decouples thrust and lateral force sensing. This approach addresses the challenge of acquiring force information from the deep tool tip within the body. We also introduce a tool tip skidding estimation method based on the deflection curve model and the Spatial-Beam Constraint Model (SBCM). A specialized simulation device for measuring tool tip offset and force was designed. The experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves average sensing errors of 31.8 mN and 43.5 mN for lateral forces at the tool tip along the X and Y directions, respectively. Additionally, the system's resolution for skidding estimation reaches 0.2 mm. Real bone drilling experiments confirm the system’s ability to effectively provide feedback on skidding during surgery. The proposed method enhances the safety of orthopedic surgical robots and offers crucial sensing information for lateral forces and skidding, paving the way for future autonomous bone drilling procedures."

To overcome these challenges, we propose a teleoperated robotic system with two arms to provide high-fidelity intraoperative volumetric imaging during micro-scale tissue manipulation. This system incorporates an optical coherence tomography sensor for real-time 3D visualization and a dual-arm teleoperated robot system controlled by haptic input devices for accurate and precise manipulation. We characterize the system’s performance through a precision positioning task and a vessel following task in a retinal model, which shows average positioning errors of approximately 232 μm and 83 μm, respectively. We demonstrate the fully integrated system through the completion of an eggshell membrane peeling task that simulates retinal membrane peeling."

Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots, the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence. It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator. Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based approaches.

In this work, we present BlueKoi, an untethered, fish-inspired robotic platform that leverages both a stiff tuna-inspired tail for efficient swimming and a koi-inspired rotating head for maneuvering, reaching speeds of 1.84 body lengths per second and a turn radius of 1.93 body lengths. We experimentally quantify the robot’s turn radius under varying conditions and develop a reduced-order model to both understand the turning behavior and inform future design decisions, without needing explicit measurements of hydrodynamic coefficients. Furthermore, we show that our model is not only accurate but also capable of extending simulations to account for future design modifications. By decoupling propulsion and maneuver-ability, BlueKoi is a scalable and modular platform that enables adaptability for diverse sensing and navigation needs."

To perform these tasks safely and reliably, robots must be able to quickly adapt in response to unexpected changes during task execution, and should also learn from past experience to better inform future decisions. Humans can intuitively respond and adapt their manipulation strategy to suit such problems, but representing and implementing such behaviors for robots remains a challenge. In this work we show how this can be achieved within the framework of behavior trees. We present the adaptive behavior tree, a scalable and generalizable behavior tree design that enables a robot to quickly adapt to and learn from both visual and non-visual observations during task execution, preempting task failure or switching to a different manipulation strategy. The adaptive behavior tree selects the manipulation strategy that is predicted to optimize task performance, and learns from past experience to improve these predictions for future attempts. We test our approach on a variety of tasks commonly found in industry; the adaptive behavior tree demonstrates safety, robustness (100% success rate) and efficiency in task completion (up to 36% task speedup from the baseline)."

    "abstract": "Soft robotics leverages highly elastic, deformable materials to enable sensitive human-centered applications in medicine, rehabilitation, and assistance, as well as industrial applications like robotic grasping and load-bearing. One particular type of soft robotic actuator - the pneumatically-actuated, soft robotic, telescopic structure (PASTS) - is a relatively new concept that utilises compliant material and geometry reminiscent of traditional telescopes to produce linear motion and force exertion. Previous works on telescopic soft actuators have focused on specific applications rather than fundamental mechanics, creating a clear knowledge gap in understanding their design, dynamics, and dependencies. This paper provides an in-depth study of the fundamental design parameters of soft telescopic actuators, and examines the impacts of certain critical dimensions and geometries on the physical behaviour and capabilities of these soft actuators. It revolves around the exploration of the influence of telescopic structure’s length, wall thickness and number of rings on its inflation and deflation behaviour, lifting and lowering speed, and motion smoothness. By experimentally verifying these relationships using several design variations, it demonstrates that telescopic structures are capable of repeatable linear extension within 0.85 mm of precision. It also determines the varying degrees±by which each critical parameter affects the desirable properties of the actuator, allowing for telescopic structures to be tailored and optimised for specific applications."

    "abstract": "Developing general robotic systems capable of manipulating in unstructured environments is a significant challenge, particularly as the tasks involved are typically long-horizon and rich-contact, requiring efficient skill transfer across different task scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose knowledge graph-based skill library construction method. This method hierarchically organizes manipulation knowledge using \"task graph\" and \"scene graph\" to represent task-specific and scene-specific information, respectively. Additionally, we introduce \"state graph\" to facilitate the interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information. Building upon this foundation, we further propose a novel hierarchical skill transfer framework based on the skill library and tactile representation, which integrates high-level reasoning for skill transfer and low-level precision for execution. At the task level, we utilize large language models (LLMs) and combine contextual learning with a four-stage chain-of-thought prompting paradigm to achieve subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, we develop an adaptive trajectory transfer method based on the skill library and the heuristic path planning algorithm. At the physical level, we propose an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception method based on tactile representation. This method dynamically acquires high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile images, adjusting parameters such as contact position and posture to ensure the effectiveness of transferred skills in new environments. Experiments demonstrate the skill transfer and adaptability capabilities of the proposed methods across different task scenarios. Project website: https://github.com/MingchaoQi/skill_transfer"

While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method."

While GNSS accuracy is often limited by atmospheric effects, multipath, and signal blockages. We propose a novel positioning method that combines perspective view images with satellite images retrieved based on rough GNSS positions to achieve precise three-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) pose estimation. Our method leverages the Swin Transformer for satellite image processing and semantic completion for monocular image analysis. By extracting depth and semantic information from monocular images, we convert these to overhead projections, effectively bridging the gap between different viewpoints. This cross-view transformation allows for precise alignment of features from monocular images onto semantically enriched satellite images. Additionally, we integrate a robust global position estimator using the semantic information from satellite images to further enhance accuracy and robustness. The experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in various complex scenarios; we successfully improved the positioning accuracy within 1 m to 80.67% and the heading in 1° to 33.78%.

    "abstract": "The Visual-Inertial Odometry has been widely deployed on autonomous robots traveling in open outdoor scenarios. However, the visual measurements will be influenced heavily by the observation distances, perspectives, lighting and texture conditions, with distinct and time-varying noise distributions of measurements. Existing methods for handling time-varying noise in Visual-Inertial Odometry regard all measurement noise as identically distributed, unable to effectively deal with the distinct noise in open outdoor scenarios, which degrades the localization accuracy. In this paper, a Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter with Adaptive multivariate noise parameters Clustering and estimation for visual-inertial odometry (CAMSCKF) is proposed to address the issue, which can separately track the measurement noise covariance matrix (MNCM) of different measurement clusters and adjust the MNCM in real-time. Firstly, the joint distribution of the state and the MNCM coefficients for each cluster is modeled as an Gaussian-Multivariate Generalized Inverse Gaussian distribution. Subsequently, an Expectation Maximization algorithm-based stepwise adaptive measurement clustering method is designed, which clusters measurements according to their corresponding innovations. Finally, an analytical update method for the joint posterior distribution without fixed-point iteration is implemented, achieving adaptive adjustment of the MNCM, thereby enabling accurate and robust Visual-Inertial Odometry localization. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations and dataset experiments, especially under the aggressive motion. In the experiments of the challenging outdoor dataset UZH-FPV, the proposed method has improved the average position and attitude estimation accuracy by 35.69% and 32.88%, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art ANGIG-KF."

Its extensive spatial range is typically captured by cameras or drones from multiple perspectives, resulting in frequent and complex viewpoint shifts. These challenges encompass nearly all difficulties inherent in human-centric tracking tasks. In this paper, we introduce SkiTrack, the first dataset explicitly designed for tracking in aerial skiing. SkiTrack enhances the performance of existing tracking algorithms across a range of human-centric scenarios by providing precise annotations. We observe distinct characteristics in the tracked components, with the skis being rigid and low in visibility and the athlete’s body highly deformable but more visible. To leverage these differences, we propose a components decoupled loss that applies separate constraints to the tracking of the athlete and skis, thereby improving tracking accuracy in skiing scenes. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of both the SkiTrack dataset and the proposed decoupled loss function, demonstrating consistent improvements in the performance of established models on human-centric tracking tasks.

Inspection systems such as Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) are employed to detect internal defects, particularly within the Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC) layer.

This study proposes a self-supervised image denoising framework called Multi-Branch Task U-Net (MBT-UNet), which is a U-Net backbone with a multi-branch decoder. The model enables multi-task learning without requiring paired clean-noisy data or prior knowledge of noise characteristics. An empirical study of semiconductor packaging is conducted to validate the proposed MBT-UNet by comparing it with several benchmark methods (e.g., paired supervised learning approaches such as SC-UNet and RIDNet). The results show that MBT-UNet achieves competitive performance, as evaluated by the feature similarity (FSIM) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metrics, and is comparable to supervised models despite being trained without paired data."

    "abstract": "In Visual Sensor Networks (VSNs), the generation and transmission of a large quantity of image data lead to huge network traffic. As a result, their lifetime is short and their delay is long. Therefore, reducing their traffic is critical to prolonging their lifetime and shortening their latency. Since the feature data of an image is much smaller than raw data, deploying processing nodes near camera nodes to extract the features of their images for transmission can greatly reduce network traffic. Moreover, installing camera nodes of multiple types can also help, since their use can decrease the total size of images. This work comprehensively utilizes these two measures and investigates how to deploy a heterogeneous VSN to satisfy sampling frequency requirements of targets and gather features of their images while minimizing the network deployment cost and meeting the network lifetime requirement. We formulate this important and new problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program and propose a separate node deployment algorithm and a joint one to solve it. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that both success rate and solution quality of the latter are higher than those of the former at the expense of computational time."

However, “dropouts” will lead to an excess of zeros in the scRNA-seq data due to technical constraints, which could hinder further analysis. Consequently, imputing the dropout values becomes particularly critical in assisting with the recovery of biological information. Herein, we propose a dual-branch imputation method for scRNA seq data, which helps to impute the drops in scRNA-seq data. Unlike previous methods which assume a preconceived structure guiding to impute the dropouts, we believe that there are linear and non-linear associations that help structure the data, thus, both linear and non-linear pipelines are combined for dropout imputation. The evaluation and comprehensive downstream results on both simulated and real datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for recovery of gene expression, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, and pseudo-time trajectory analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Target imaging is a crucial component of target detection and recognition applications in synthetic aperture interferometric radiometer (SAIR). Traditional target imaging frameworks are usually based on hand-crafted priors or deep learning (DL) techniques. The former improves image quality by introducing prior information, but has scene dependency and limited performance. The latter learns the inverse mapping from visibility samples to target images, but relies on large labeled datasets and exhibits significant task specificity. In this article, we propose a target imaging framework, namely implicit interferometric radiometer (IIR). It employs the implicit neural network prior (INNP) to perform high-accuracy SAIR target image reconstruction, which offers low impedance to signals and high impedance to noise and degradations. First, an untrained neural network model is constructed with fixed random noise as input, and the network implicit inductive bias is exploited to generate an estimated result of the target image. The estimated brightness temperature (BT) image is then forward-modeled through the system response matrix to obtain corresponding simulated visibility samples. A joint loss function is formulated, consisting of a fidelity term between measured and simulated visibility samples and customized regularization terms, to guide the network training. The untrained network weights are iteratively optimized by backpropagation to finally recover the desired target image. The proposed target imaging framework operates without reliance on training data and has good generalization capability. The feasibility and effectiveness of IIR are verified using both simulated and real data. The results indicate that IIR achieves better performance compared with conventional methods in terms of image quality, noise suppression, and robustness against missing baselines."

Personalizing teaching based on students’ learning styles has been shown to enhance motivation and learning outcomes. The Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) is widely recognized as effective for digital and game-based learning environments. However, conventional learning style detection methods relying on questionnaires pose challenges for younger learners, including difficulty in comprehension and low motivation to complete surveys. This study proposes an automatic learning style detection approach for the Sequential-Global dimension of FSLSM using a jigsaw puzzle, a reading-based game, and a fuzzy inference system (FIS) that analyzes gameplay parameters. A novel parameter, order percentage, was proposed and validated to capture sequential placement tendencies, alongside completion percentage, number of tries, and active time percentage for learning style prediction. The prototype was evaluated by 72 primary school students from three schools. Results showed strong agreement between FIS predictions and traditional questionnaire-based labels, achieving an overall accuracy of 84.7%. Ablation analysis revealed that order percentage and completion percentage were the most influential predictors, while active time percentage contributed minimally. Feedback from post-questionnaires indicated a strong student preference for the proposed game activities over traditional learning style detection questionnaire. Over 90% of students reported greater motivation, engagement, and willingness to reattempt the game compared to the questionnaire. Overall, findings from this study confirm that game-based approaches can effectively serve as an automated learning style detection tool for Generation Alpha learners."

Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based RGBT tracking has attracted much attention due to the strong modeling capacity of self attention and cross attention mechanisms. These attention mechanisms utilize the correlations among tokens to construct powerful feature representations, but are easily affected by low-quality tokens. To address this issue, we propose a novel Quality-aware Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (QSTNet), which calculates the quality weights of tokens in search regions based on the correlation with multimodal template tokens to suppress the negative effects of low-quality tokens in spatio-temporal feature representations, for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, we argue that the correlation between search tokens of one modality and multimodal template tokens could reflect the quality of these search tokens, and thus design the Quality-aware Token Weighting Module (QTWM) based on the correlation matrix of search and template tokens to suppress the negative effects of low-quality tokens. Specifically, we calculate the difference matrix derived from the attention matrices of the search tokens from both modalities and the multimodal template tokens, and then assign the quality weight for each search token based on the difference matrix, which reflects the relative correlation of search tokens from different modalities to multimodal template tokens. In addition, we propose the Prompt-based Spatio-temporal Encoder Module (PSEM) to utilize spatio-temporal multimodal information while alleviating the impact of low-quality spatio-temporal features. Extensive experiments on four RGBT benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed QSTNet exhibits superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art tracking methods.

    "abstract": "The openness of wireless networks enables flexible connections on devices, but also arises the security and privacy concerns on adversarial eavesdropping. By concealing the transmissions from eavesdropper, covert communication preserves the privacy of communications and has become a significant research topic. Whereas, existing works primarily focus on the covertness of communication links, neglecting the protection for the critical leader nodes response for information aggregation and decision making in information systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel concept <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">covert leader</i>, whose identity remains concealed from all other nodes while performing leadership functions. This design inherently mitigates targeted attacks (e.g., eavesdropping, jamming, DoS) against leaders, enhancing both privacy and robustness of wireless network. Then, a distributed randomized <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>-Covert Leader Election (KCLE) algorithm is designed, in which <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> is a hyperparameter to depict the covertness of leader election and can be adjusted when KCLE algorithm is implemented in reality. Unlike cryptographic solutions, KCLE leverages physical-layer signal properties to elect a leader from at least <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> candidates with balanced energy-time tradeoffs, ensuring no leader identity leakage occurs during election. The algorithm operates without complex encryption, making it suitable for resource-constrained Internet-of-Things and ad hoc networks. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate KCLE’s correctness, covertness guarantees, and operational efficiency under SINR interference models."

    "abstract": "In recent years, chaotic systems featuring multi-scroll/wing structures with hidden dynamics have garnered growing interest. Existing design methods, however, are often tailored to specific systems and lack generality. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a universal multistable memristor feedback scheme (MMFS) for constructing multi-scroll/wing chaotic systems devoid of equilibria. The scheme integrates an equilibrium-free seed system with a memristive feedback network and a state feedback controller. Mechanism analysis reveals that the multi-scroll/wing structures originate from virtual equilibria mapped from the stable fixed points of the memristors. The scheme's generality and effectiveness are verified through three distinct chaotic systems: a double-scroll system, a double-wing system, and a conservative chaotic system. Numerical simulations and DSP-based hardware experiments show close agreement. Furthermore, the number of scrolls/wings can be precisely controlled by adjusting memristor parameters. As a practical application, a pseudo-random number generator based on a multi-wing system is implemented, showcasing its potential for cryptographic applications."

The proposed approach is validated through experiments with a maximum power of 500 W, demonstrating smooth transient performance under varying conditions."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This work presents a bit-wise chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) tag detection framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework demonstrates two key capabilities: first, unlike previously proposed models, it allows decoding tag identifiers not used during the training phase of the models, making it possible to introduce a decoding method that could potentially be applied to detect high-capacity chipless tags; and second, it illustrates how synthetic data can be used to train models that generalize to real measurements, showing how instead of measuring each tag individually to construct a training dataset, data can instead be synthetically generated based on the knowledge of the tags’ design. Moreover, the framework includes a correction process to manage invalid predictions (i.e., those that are not part of the set of considered tags) and a probabilistic-based filtering process to identify uncertain predictions. Together, these strategies result in more confident predictions and fewer errors overall, showcasing the utility of error-correction strategies and the use of “soft” classifiers. The framework is assessed using different datasets for training: a dataset obtained from the recordings of S21 of wireless frequency-coded chipless RFID tags in a monostatic configuration, a synthetic dataset generated by modeling resonators as second-order bandpass filters, and a dataset made of the two previous datasets. All models are then employed to predict measurements made in a real-world setup. In the interval 20–50 cm, the model trained with real measurements achieves an accuracy of 99% after filtering, with a predictions conserved ratio (PCR) of 0.62; the one trained with synthetic measurements achieves an accuracy of 98% with a PCR of 0.61; and the one trained with a combination of real and synthetic measurements leads to an accuracy of 97% with a PCR of 0.70. If the distance is decreased (e.g., to 20–30 cm), higher accuracies and PCR values are obtained, as expected, achieving more than 99% accuracy after filtering in all cases. Overall, these results show how the proposed framework can correctly predict tags not seen during training, and how synthetic data can be used to train the models without harming their performance, while at the same time decreasing the time of measurement collection."

In Brazil, the Military Fire Departments are responsible for this analysis, which requires a high level of attention and technical detail.

This study presents the development of a customized dataset for training a symbol detection model in fire protection projects using the YOLOv8 architecture. To achieve this, a dataset containing 400 real images of fire protection projects was created, with 3120 annotated instances distributed across 12 classes of standardized fire safety symbols, following technical regulations. The results demonstrated the high efficiency of the model, achieving a mAP@50 of 92.1 during validation and 96.2 in the final test set.

    "abstract": "Compared to Full-Model Fine-Tuning (FMFT), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has demonstrated superior efficacy and efficiency in several code understanding tasks, owing to PEFT’s ability to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) by updating only a small number of parameters. However, existing studies primarily involve static code comprehension, aligning with the pre-training paradigm of recent PLMs and facilitating knowledge transfer, but they do not account for dynamic code changes. Thus, it remains unclear whether PEFT outperforms FMFT in task-specific adaptation for code-change-related tasks. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">To address this question, we examine four prevalent PEFT methods (i.e., AT, LoRA, PT, and PreT) and compare their performance with FMFT across seven popular PLMs. In experiments, two widely studied code-change-related tasks, i.e., Just-In-Time Defect Prediction (JIT-DP) and Commit Message Generation (CMG) are involved, demonstrating that the four PEFT methods can surpass FMFT on JIT-DP but only exhibit comparable performances at best on CMG in common scenarios. While in cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios, they exhibit relative superiority. Afterward, a series of probing tasks from both static and dynamic perspectives are conducted in this paper, offering detailed explanations for the efficacy of PEFT and FMFT. Inspired by the distinctive advantages of PEFT and FMFT in their layer-wise probing results, we propose Pasta<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>, a self-adaPtive efficient layer-specific tuning framework for PLMs in code change learning, which combines FMFT and PEFT during the domain adaptation according to the guidance of probing results.

Even, Pasta<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> outperforms FMFT by 1.48%, 3.21%, and 1.87% at most in terms of BLEU, Meteor, and Rouge-L, while saving 26.26% and 20.65% in terms of training time and computational memory compared with FMFT.</p>"

    "abstract": "Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DRworkflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy."

Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors, restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced, achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests, comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing inspection autonomy."

However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations.

Here, we propose a novel bidirectional approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic interaction between the layers. This method effectively maps commands to task allocation and actions to path planning, while leveraging cross– training techniques to enhance learning across the hierarchical framework. Furthermore, we introduce a trajectory prediction model that bridges abstract task representations with actionable planning goals. In our experiments, it achieves over 80% in confrontation win rate and under 0.01 seconds in decision time, outperforming existing approaches. Demonstrations through large–scale tests and real–world robot experiments further emphasize the generalization capabilities and practical applicability of our method."

    "abstract": "Task-aware navigation continues to be a challenging area of research, especially in scenarios involving open vocabulary. Previous studies primarily focus on finding suitable locations for task completion, often overlooking the importance of the robot’s pose. However, the robot’s orientation is crucial for successfully completing tasks because of how objects are arranged (e.g., to open a refrigerator door). Humans intuitively navigate to objects with the right orientation using semantics and common sense. For instance, when opening a refrigerator, we naturally stand in front of it rather than to the side. Recent advances suggest that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can provide robots with similar common sense. Therefore, we develop a VLM-driven method called Navigation-to-Gaze (Navi2Gaze) for efficient navigation and object gazing based on task descriptions. This method uses the VLM to score and select the best pose from numerous candidates automatically. In evaluations on multiple photorealistic simulation benchmarks, Navi2Gaze significantly outperforms existing approaches by precisely determining the optimal orientation relative to target objects, resulting in a 68.8% reduction in Distance to Goal (DTG).

HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust and real-time anomaly detection.

Specifically, we introduce the 3D Viewpoint Quality Field (VQF), a compact and consistent representation for viewpoint quality distribution similar to an aspect graph, composed of three general-purpose viewpoint quality metrics: self-occlusion ratio, occupancy-aware surface normal entropy, and visual entropy. We utilize pre-trained image encoders to extract robust visual and semantic features, which are then decoded into the 3D VQF, allowing our model to generalize effectively across diverse objects, including unseen categories. The lightweight ViewActive network (72 FPS on a single GPU) significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art object recognition pipelines and can be integrated into real-time motion planning for robotic applications.

    "abstract": "In human communication, referring to a specific object within an environment often involves the combination of a pointing gesture to indicate the object’s direction and linguistic descriptions specifying its name and attributes, thereby enabling precise object identification. Inspired by this natural multimodal interaction, we formalize the zero-shot object navigation driven by language and pointing gesture (LGZSON) task, which aims to more closely approximate real-world human-agent communication scenarios. To address this task, we propose LGNav, an open-set, training-free navigation framework. LGNav estimates the pointing gesture direction by extracting human body landmarks and integrates this directional information with depth images to initialize a versatile candidate position map (VCPM). The framework further employs open-vocabulary object detection to identify all potential candidate objects in the environment, projecting them onto the VCPM. Guided by a motion policy derived from the VCPM, LGNav continuously explores the unknown environment, sequentially visits candidate objects, and utilizes a large vision-language model (LVLM) to verify whether each candidate object satisfies the given navigation instruction. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of LGNav, demonstrating its strong performance in the LG-ZSON task. Furthermore, even in the absence of pointing gestures, LGNav achieves competitive results on standard object navigation benchmarks, including the Gibson and HM3D datasets, outperforming a range of strong baseline methods."

    "abstract": "When mobile apps are used extensively in our daily lives, their responsiveness has become an important factor that can negatively impact the user experience. The long response time of a mobile app can be caused by a variety of reasons, including soft hang bugs or prolonged user interface APIs (UIAPIs). While hang bugs have been researched extensively before, our investigation on UI-APIs in today's mobile OS finds that the recursive construction of UI view hierarchy often can be time-consuming, due to the complexity of today's UI views. To accelerate UI processing, such complex views can be preprocessed and cached before the user even visits them. However, pre-caching every view in a mobile app is infeasible due to the incurred overheads on time, energy, and cache space. In this paper, we propose MAPP, a framework for Mobile App Predictive Pre-caching. MAPP has two main modules, 1) UI view prediction based on deep learning and 2) UI-API pre-caching, which coordinate to improve the responsiveness of mobile apps. MAPP adopts a per-user and per-app prediction model that is tailored based on the analysis of collected user traces, such as location, time, or the sequence of previously visited views. A dynamic feature ranking and model selection algorithm is designed to judiciously filter out less relevant features for improving the prediction accuracy with less computation overhead. MAPP is evaluated with 61 real-world traces from 18 volunteers over 30 days to show that it can shorten the response time of mobile apps by 59.84 % on average with an average cache hit rate of 92.55 %."

Nevertheless, their dynamic behavior is seldom modeled or experimentally validated. This knowledge gap hampers the accuracy of transientresponse studies and closed-loop control design. The present study rigorously assesses an inertial disk's conventional firstorder Coulomb-viscous model and proposes a data-driven identification framework that dispenses with shaft-mounted torque sensors. Angular-speed rundown tests were performed on a 0.5 hp induction motor fitted with three disk assemblies spanning <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{J}=0.704-0.759 ~\\text{kg} \\cdot \\mathbf{m}^{2}$</tex>.

The high-speed error is related to accelerationdependent effects neglected in classical formulations, which may be related to the jerk effect. These results demonstrate that (i) PSO can recover mechanical parameters directly from speed data, and (ii) the classical model cannot represent the dynamics of all operational points, mainly for higher inertial values. The proposed methodology strengthens the reliability of DLE setups and industrial motor diagnostics where accurate inertial emulation is critical."

However, to ensure that this integration contributes to improving the quality indicators of the electric energy delivered by the power distribution network, it is essential to define both the connection point and the operational area of the energy community. This paper presents a methodology for forming energy communities in urban distribution networks by clustering photovoltaic systems and public charging stations for electric vehicles to minimize voltage drops within their operational area. The approach integrates geospatial analysis, reinforcement learning techniques, and a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise Algorithm to identify optimal configurations. We applied the proposal to a power distribution feeder in the city of Santo André, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The results indicate a potential reduction of up to 15% in voltage drops for the demand of charging stations, thereby improving voltage profiles across the network and enhancing the local use of solar energy to meet electric vehicle demand."

Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid social robots still relies on pre-programmed be-havioral patterns, which are manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms. Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects."

Current SLAM benchmarks overlook the importance of repeatability (precision) despite its impact on real-world deployments. TaskSLAM-Bench, a task-driven approach to SLAM benchmarking, addresses this gap. It employs precision as a key metric, accounts for SLAM’s mapping capabilities, and has easy-to-meet requirements. Simulated and real-world evaluation of SLAM methods provide insights into the navigation performance of modern visual and LiDAR SLAM solutions. The outcomes show that passive stereo SLAM precision may match that of 2D LiDAR SLAM in indoor environments. TaskSLAM-Bench complements existing benchmarks and offers richer assessment of SLAM performance in navigation-focused scenarios. Publicly available code permits in-situ SLAM testing in custom environments with properly equipped robots."

    "abstract": "Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle’s surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods."

Our approach introduces a Motion Deformable Block (MDB) that adaptively adjusts the receptive field based on pixel-wise motion information at different stages of the network, enhancing multi-scale feature descriptor robustness in blurred conditions. Additionally, we construct synthetic blurred datasets to systematically benchmark feature matching performance across varying blur intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Motion-Feat outperforms state-of-the-art methods on blurred images while maintaining competitive performance on sharp images for relative camera pose estimation and homography estimation tasks.

However, their softness makes accurate control challenging, and high-fidelity sensing is a prerequisite to adequate control performance. To this end, many flexible and embedded sensors have been created over the past decade, but they inevitably increase the robot’s complexity and stiffness. This study demonstrates a novel approach that uses simple bending strain gauges embedded inside a modular arm to extract complex information regarding its deformation and working conditions. The core idea is based on physical reservoir computing (PRC): A soft body’s rich nonlinear dynamic responses, captured by the inter-connected bending sensor network, could be utilized for complex multi-modal sensing with a simple linear regression algorithm. Our results show that the soft modular arm reservoir can accurately predict body posture (bending angle), estimate payload weight, determine payload orientation, and even differentiate two payloads with only minimal difference in weight — all using minimal digital computing power."

Continuous asset monitoring has emerged as a key enabler of data-driven asset management. By integrating online and offline data along with a comprehensive risk assessment, utilities can better evaluate a transformer fleet, optimize maintenance strategies, and support strategic decisions regarding repair, replacement, or investment in monitoring technologies. This work discusses the parameters used for power transformer condition and risk assessment and presents a framework for a tool designed to support resource allocation and investment prioritization in power transformer fleet asset management."

FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

The proposed framework leverages prior environmental information to iteratively integrate task planning, task assignment, and prior belief updating, enabling efficient exploration in unknown underwater environments. An interest area selection strategy is proposed to balance the exploration of uncharted regions and the exploitation of areas with high target likelihood. To optimize interest area task allocation, a simultaneous auctionbased mechanism is developed that assigns each interest area to the most suitable UUV by maxing potential information gain while minimizing operational costs. Additionally, to address the computational constraints of UUV systems, a Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with variationally optimized inducing points is employed, enabling rapid and accurate fusion of real-time observations with prior environmental information. This approach facilitates dynamic updates of the probabilistic environment representation and interest point selection without compromising accuracy. Experimental results in the HoloOcean simulator demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness in refining the probabilistic environment representation, achieving efficient exploration and accurate target detection in complex underwater scenarios. The results highlight the framework’s capability to dynamically adapt to environmental uncertainties, showcasing its potential for underwater exploration applications."

Subjects were categorized into K2 (walking speeds 0.4–0.8m/s) and K3 (0.6–1.4m/s) functional levels. Our findings show that both groups demonstrate high sagittal-plane VPP quality, comparable to that of healthy individuals, with R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> > 95%, indicating a strong relationship between VPP formation and sagittal plane dynamics. Conversely, in the frontal plane, VPP analysis reveals greater variability and lower quality, indicating the absence of a well-defined pivot during gait. Notably, frontal-plane VPP quality deteriorates with increasing walking speed, particularly in K3 ambulators. While this speed-dependency is observed in healthy individuals as well, the rate of decline is significantly steeper in amputees. Additionally, spatial analysis of VPP positions reveals a consistent elevation of the amputated leg’s VPP compared to the intact leg. These findings emphasize the importance of frontal plane dynamics in amputee gait and suggest improvements in prosthetic design to enhance control and promote more symmetrical, natural gait."

The study is mostly about optical ring resonators (ORRs), which can measure glucose levels in biological fluids like blood and urine very accurately. ORRs can accurately measure the amount or level of glucose present by looking at how the resonance frequency and refractive index of biosensor changes with different glucose concentrations. The method finds out how much glucose present in a sample by predicting the refractive index at different wavelengths and amplitudes. The results of the study show that the method is accurate and reliable, which means it could be used as a quick and accurate way to diagnose diabetes for live monitoring. As result we found the resonant frequency was 36.026459 for urine samples with normal glucose levels (165−180 mg/dl) and 0.348478 for blood samples. This optical biosensor method is non-invasive, which is very important because it makes patients less uncomfortable than traditional (old method) invasive blood tests. This feature makes it easier to find things early on, most importantly, this optical sensor method is non-invasive, which means it doesn't hurt the patient as much as traditional blood tests do and it provides live monitoring of diabetic level in human body. This feature of biosensor makes it easier to find diabetes early, which speeds up and improves treatment, leading to better outcomes for patients and a better quality of life. The results show that this new method could be a useful and effective way to treat this common long-term diabetic illness. This diabetic detection method is very important for senior citizens, pregnant woman and anyone because they can directly monitor their diabetic level in body by continuous /live monitoring of diabetic."

    "abstract": "Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is widely used to mitigate drift in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) systems. Consistency is crucial for ensuring the estimation accuracy of a UWB-aided VIO system. An inconsistent estimator can degrade localization performance, where the inconsistency primarily arises from two main factors: (1) the estimator fails to preserve the correct system observability, and (2) UWB anchor positions are assumed to be known, leading to improper neglect of calibration uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a consistent and tightly-coupled visual-inertial-ranging odometry (CVIRO) system based on the Lie group. Our method incorporates the UWB anchor state into the system state, explicitly accounting for UWB calibration uncertainty and enabling the joint and consistent estimation of both robot and anchor states. Further-more, observability consistency is ensured by leveraging the invariant error properties of the Lie group. We analytically prove that the CVIRO algorithm naturally maintains the system’s correct unobservable subspace, thereby preserving estimation consistency. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that CVIRO achieves superior localization accuracy and consistency compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in the hierarchical decomposition of complex tasks through semantic reasoning. However, their application in embodied systems faces challenges in ensuring reliable execution of subtask sequences and achieving one-shot success in long-term task completion. To address these limitations in dynamic environments, we propose Closed-Loop Embodied Agent (CLEA)—a novel architecture incorporating four specialized open-source LLMs with functional decoupling for closed-loop task management. The framework features two core innovations: (1) Interactive task planner that dynamically generates executable subtasks based on the environmental memory, and (2) Multimodal execution critic employing an evaluation framework to conduct a probabilistic assessment of action feasibility, triggering hierarchical re-planning mechanisms when environmental perturbations exceed preset thresholds. To validate CLEA’s effectiveness, we conduct experiments in a real environment with manipulable objects, using two heterogeneous robots for object search, manipulation, and search-manipulation integration tasks. Across 12 task trials, CLEA outperforms the baseline model, achieving a 67.3% improvement in success rate and a 52.8% increase in task completion rate. These results demonstrate that CLEA significantly enhances the robustness of task planning and execution in dynamic environments. Our code is available at https://sp4595.github.io/CLEA/."

    "abstract": "Optimizing the initial angle of the shoulder’s base frame is crucial for defining the workspace and enhancing the manipulation performance of humanoid robotic arms. Previous studies primarily emphasized geometric analyses, neglecting dynamic factors, which limits their practical applicability. This study presents a multi-metric optimization framework to enhance the dynamic performance of humanoid robotic arms by optimizing the shoulder’s initial angle. We formulate a cost function that incorporates torque efficiency, energy consumption, and overload ratio, utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm for optimization. Furthermore, to address the limitations of conventional geometric workspace analysis, we introduce the concept of effective workspace, integrating dynamic constraints to quantitatively evaluate the effects of optimized shoulder angles. We validate the proposed framework in a hybrid simulation environment combining MuJoCo and RBDL, using the KIST humanoid and Unitree G1 robotic arms. Experimental results confirm that the optimized shoulder angles enhance torque distribution, expanding the effective workspace by 18.4% and 3.78% for the KIST and Unitree G1 robotic arms, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the proposed optimization framework enhances manipulation and dynamic performance as well as energy efficiency and system reliability, contributing to advancements in humanoid robotic arm design."

    "abstract": "Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agents’ predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI’s gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI’s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenét planner, and vanilla MPPI.

    "abstract": "Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent’s ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent’s ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validates the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our method."

Although much work has been done in evaluating robustness for visuomotor policies, the robustness evaluation of a multisensory approach that includes force-torque sensing remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel, factor-based evaluation framework with the goal of assessing the robustness of multisensory policies in a peg-in-hole assembly task. To this end, we develop a multisensory policy framework utilizing the Perceiver IO architecture to learn the task. We investigate which factors pose the greatest generalization challenges in object assembly and explore a simple multisensory data augmentation technique to enhance out-of-distribution performance. We provide a simulation environment enabling controlled evaluation of these factors. Our results reveal that multisensory variations such as Grasp Pose present the most significant challenges for robustness, and naive unisensory data augmentation applied independently to each sensory modality proves insufficient to overcome them. Additionally, we find force-torque sensing to be the most informative modality for our contact-rich assembly task, with vision being the least informative. Finally, we briefly discuss supporting real-world experimental results. For additional experiments and qualitative results, we refer to the project webpage https://rpm-lab-umn.github.io/auginsert/."

However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control.

OSG leverages shape-based classification techniques, including Hu moments, Zernike moments, and Fourier descriptors, to robustly recognize gestures in visually-challenging underwater environments. Our system achieves high accuracy on real-world underwater video data and operates efficiently on embedded hardware commonly found on autonomous underwater robots (AUVs), demonstrating its feasibility for deployment on-board robots. Compared to deep learning approaches, OSG is lightweight, computationally efficient, and highly adaptable, making it ideal for diver-to-robot communication. We evaluate OSG’s performance on an augmented gesture dataset and real-world underwater video data, comparing its accuracy against deep learning methods. Our results show OSG’s potential to enhance U-HRI by enabling the immediate deployment of user-defined gestures without the constraints of predefined gesture languages."

Those out-of-distribution situations for legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT), a variation of transformer, could achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy’s robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally, despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging corruption noise during testing."

Due to the limited receptive field of convolutional neural networks, most existing methods based on deep learning mainly focus on the local features, instead of taking into account the global context from entire image. The purpose of this work is to enhance the detection and description process of keypoints by leveraging global information obtained from Transformer, and to boost the consistence between keypoints and descriptors through their interaction. Specifically, the above two improvements are respectively implemented through the Local & Global Context Aggregation (LGCA) Module and Point & Descriptor Cross Augmentation (PDCA) Module proposed in this article. The LGCA module, which can model the long-range context, is inserted a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to extract features which contain diverse scales and different receptive fields. Moreover, the PDCA module enhances descriptors by the geometry information of keypoints detected, while enhancing the keypoint detection process by the position coordinates of correctly matched descriptors.

These fused representations are used to continuously adjust two critical gait parameters (step height and hip splay), enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. To generate terrain representations, we process visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The Cross Attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for informed gait adaptation. This fused representation allows CROSS-GAiT to continuously adjust gait parameters in response to unpredictable terrain conditions in real-time. We train CROSS-GAiT on a diverse set of terrains including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand and validate its generalization ability on unseen environments. Our hardware implementation on the Ghost Robotics Vision 60 demonstrates superior performance in challenging terrains, such as high-density vegetation, unstable surfaces, sandbanks, and deformable substrates. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios.

Various robots such as snake robots, drones, and throwing robots for life-saving missions on behalf of humans at disaster sites have been studied. In particular the hybrid type throwing robot can have both the throwing ease of the ball type and the driving stability of the wheel type. However, it requires the tail to be stored inside when being thrown and to be rigidly deployed when driving. To satisfy these requirements, we developed a foldable tail based on scissor lift structure in our previous study. But, such a structure was composed of only rigid parts, which caused interference with other parts when stored, and difficulty about changing the maximum deployed tail length further. To overcome these limitations, we wanted to develop a bistable tail suitable for the hybrid type that can maintain a bendable state and a rigid state. Before actual development, we calculate the minimum tail length for overcoming obstacle through statics analysis. Then, we design a bistable structure utilizing a reconfigurable laminate mechanism. Next, we calculate the design constraints to mount it on the actual robot. Finally, the developed tail is mounted on the actual Throwbot to perform obstacle overcoming experiments. We confirm that it can secure both ease throwing and stable obstacle overcoming ability. Through this, we propose a bistable tail suitable for the hybrid type throwing robots."

Traditional approaches, such as artificial potential fields (APFs), suffer from local minima, oscillations, and limited scalability, while model predictive control (MPC) can be computationally expensive. Control barrier functions (CBFs) offer a promising alternative due to their high level of robustness and low computational cost, but these safety filters must be carefully designed to avoid significant reductions in the overall performance of the manipulator. In this work, we introduce an Operational Space Control Barrier Function (OSCBF) framework that integrates safety constraints while preserving task-consistent behavior. Our approach scales to hundreds of simultaneous constraints while retaining real-time control rates, ensuring collision avoidance, singularity prevention, and workspace containment even in highly cluttered settings or during dynamic motions. By explicitly accounting for the task hierarchy in the CBF objective, we prevent degraded performance across both joint-space and operational-space tasks, when at the limit of safety. We validate performance in both simulation and hardware, and release our open-source high-performance code and media on our project webpage, https://stanfordasl.github.io/oscbf/"

While Detection Response Task (DRT) reaction times correlate with Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) scores, existing mapping techniques often suffer from overfitting and poor generalization due to unregularized high-degree polynomials and ad hoc filtering. This study presents a regression framework for estimating KSS from DRT data, integrated into a multimodal fusion and embedded-systems architecture. The pipeline applies quantile-based scaling, RANSAC-based outlier removal, low-degree polynomial expansion, and Ridge regularization, with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV. Evaluation on data from 20 drivers across 80 simulated sessions showed a 17 % reduction in mean absolute error and a 20 % drop in mean squared error, enhancing prediction accuracy. Correlation coefficients between predicted and actual KSS more than doubled, confirming stronger alignment and increased reliability for real-time monitoring. Multimodal fusion further improved detection sensitivity and reduced false alarms by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{2 5 \\%}$</tex>.

Overall, the results validate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable, and scalable sleepiness estimation models for embedded ADAS, enabling continuous, real-time driver monitoring in safety-critical environments."

This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware end-to-end Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework focused on keypoint-based 6DoF pose estimation. Keypoints predicted by a large teacher model exhibit varying levels of uncertainty that can be exploited within the distillation process to enhance the accuracy of the student model while ensuring its compactness. To this end, we propose a distillation strategy that aligns the student and teacher predictions by adjusting the knowledge transfer based on the uncertainty associated with each teacher keypoint prediction. Additionally, the proposed KD leverages this uncertainty-aware alignment of keypoints to transfer the knowledge at key locations of their respective feature maps. Experiments on the widely-used LINEMOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior 6DoF object pose estimation with lightweight models compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further validation on the SPEED+ dataset for spacecraft pose estimation highlights the robustness of our approach under diverse 6DoF pose estimation scenarios."

    "abstract": "Conventional crop production, which is essential for providing food, feed, fuel, and fiber for our society, relies heavily on harmful herbicides to control weeds. Instead, agricultural robots could remove weeds more sustainably. However, these robots require a generalizable perception system that can locate weeds, enabling automatic removal of weeds. Specifically, they need to perform crop-weed semantic segmentation, which locates and distinguishes between the crop and the weed plants with pixel-level resolution. However, most existing crop-weed semantic segmentation methods are fully supervised and require expensive and labor-intensive pixel-wise labeling of the training data. To avoid the costly labeling process, we address the problem of unsupervised crop-weed segmentation in this paper. Unlike previous approaches, we leverage the idea that weeds are \"weird\" plants that occur less frequently and are highly variable in appearance, and reframe the problem as an anomaly segmentation problem. We propose an approach to segment weeds as anomalous plants by categorizing plants in the feature space of a pretrained foundation model. Our approach curates a bag-of-features representation of crop features and models the manifold of crop plants as hyperspheres. During inference, it classifies vegetation segments of the image with features within this manifold as crop plants and all other plants as weeds. Our experiments show that our zero-shot anomaly segmentation method can perform crop-weed segmentation on several datasets from real crop fields."

Under low-gravity conditions, during satellite manipulator operations on free-floating objects, the absence of significant gravitational forces and friction constraints leads to unpredictable relative motions between the manipulator’s end-effectors and objects, degrading the manipulation performance. This study proposes a fine manipulation method for satellite robots with floating platforms, grounded in multimodal perception and an enhanced Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) architecture that enables multimodal state interaction. By integrating visual, tactile, and depth sensory data, the satellite robot’s space fine manipulation capabilities are substantially improved.

Many existing LiDAR-based place recognition methods encode the structural information of 3D LiDAR data into 2D image representations. However, most of these intermediates only exploit the projection in a single view, ignoring a great amount of useful information. In this paper, a compact fusion-view image representation of LiDAR point cloud is proposed to extract important structural information from different views. Our proposed method generates such fusion-view images using the corresponding geometric information among points highlighting the edges of objects. It then extracts texture features encoding the shapes and layouts of scene elements into global descriptors, where regional features are designed to adapt local discrepancies caused by seasonal changes. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar, NCLT, UTBM datasets and our cross-season dataset validate the proposed method and demonstrate its superior generalization performance under different LiDAR sensors and season shifts. Moreover, our proposed method can operate online with a single CPU, making it suitable for resource-limited real robot platforms."

To ensure persistent fingertip-object contact, adaptive impedance control dynamically adjusts gripper stiffness based on real-time force thresholds, preventing unintended detachment. Experimental validation demonstrates robust performance in two representative scenarios:1) cube flipping on a compliant surface(84.3g, 90% success over 50 trials), 2) vision-free continuous pivoting of an irregular part on a rigid substrate(56g, 88% success over 50 trials).

    "abstract": "Audio classification is a rapidly advancing field that spans various domains, including speech, music, and environmental sound classification, each demanding a different balance of local details and global structure for the classification. Traditional pooling methods such as max pooling and average pooling are widely used in deep learning models but are inherently fixed and unable to adapt to specific dataset characteristics. Recent developments in adaptive pooling methods have shown promise in learning feature aggregation strategies that better align with dataset-specific properties and adaptive wavelet-based approaches are particularly suited for identifying frequency components that distinguish between local and global features. In this paper, we propose a modified Scaled Adaptive Wavelet Pooling method for audio classification tasks, which employs fast wavelet transforms to decompose the input features into multiple scales, reducing the feature dimensions by removing the fine-scale subbands. Our approach parameterizes wavelet decomposition filters and subband weights as learnable variables, enabling the model to discover optimal frequency-based representations that align with the needs of the task. Our approach is validated on speech, music, and environmental sound classification tasks using the IEMOCAP, GTZAN, and ESC-50 datasets. Experimental results show that Scaled Adaptive Wavelet Pooling consistently achieves superior performance compared to traditional and adaptive pooling baselines, achieving average classification accuracies of $\\mathbf{6 8. 1 2 \\%}$ on IEMOCAP, 89.92% on GTZAN and 88.82% on ESC-50 datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in learning task-specific spectral representations."

Centralization is a potential integrated design axis to help improve the performance of legged robots in variable terrain environments. Centralization arises from the coupling of multiple limbs and joints through mechanics or feedback control. Strong couplings contribute to a whole-body coordinated response (centralized) and weak couplings result in localized responses (decentralized). Rarely are both mechanical and neural couplings considered together in designing centralization. In this study, we use an empirical information theory-based approach to evaluate the emergent centralization of a hexapod robot. We independently vary the mechanical and neural coupling through adjustable joint stiffness and variable coupling of leg controllers, respectively. We found an increase in centralization as neural coupling increased. Changes in mechanical coupling did not significantly affect centralization during walking, but did change the total information processing of the neuromechanical control architecture. Information-based centralization increased with robotic performance in terms of cost of transport and speed, implying that this may be a useful metric in robotic design."

In this paper, an online reconfiguration strategy is proposed for a 3-DOF point-mass CDPR to adjust the cable anchor positions and enhance its performance in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The reconfiguration problem, inclusive of all relevant constraints such as the wrench feasible condition (WFC) and the structural constraint on the cable anchors, is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem to determine the optimal positions of cable anchors. However, such original formulation poses a serious challenge to real-time determination, primarily due to the non-convex constraint imposed by the WFC and the non-convex objective function. To address this issue, the characteristics of the CDPR are considered, and a linear approximation method is employed to simplify the original optimization problem into a linear one, allowing it to be efficiently solved by the dual simplex method. Additionally, an artificial potential field (APF) is designed, considering both the inherent workspace properties and the interaction force, to adjust the solution of the linear optimization problem, which ensures that the optimal solution remains within a safe distance from the boundary of the solution space. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the strategy in improving the interaction metric while satisfying constraints."

    "abstract": "In the deep learning era, 2D LiDAR perception is often overlooked as research prioritizes 3D point clouds. Yet, 2D LiDAR remains essential for low-cost robotic systems due to its affordability. Despite its simplicity, it faces major challenges-not only in perception but also in learning itself, as data sparsity and limited features hinder effective framework development. Additionally, fundamental structural differences prevent direct adaptation of 3D perception networks. To address these aforementioned concerns, we proposes LSW-Net (Laser Scan Weight-Net), a self-supervised framework for 2D LiDAR perception, enabling end-to-end learning from raw point clouds to adaptive weight extraction. This framework provides a scalable and lightweight solution for 2D LiDAR environmental perception, and its self-supervised nature reduces annotation costs.It includes: (i) a general 2D Laser Encoder (LS-Encoder) that integrates local convolutional perception with global attention perception to extract multi-scale spatio-temporal features; and (ii) an interpretable weight extraction module (Weight Extractor) that dynamically quantifies the contribution of each point in environmental perception tasks through contrastive learning and physical consistency constraints. Evaluated on diverse scenes for point cloud registration and SLAM tasks, LSW-Net outperforms traditional methods in feature discriminability and adaptability. Additionally, we performed ablation experiments to substantiate the rationality of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/cuiyujie0113/LSW-NET."

    "abstract": "Acoustic tweezers have been a valuable tool across various fields, from nano-microfabrication to biology. Their unique characteristics enable three-dimensional particle manipulation, where acoustic trapping serves as a fundamental requirement. However, traditional methods struggle to maintain steady particle positioning due to nonlinear forces and complex dynamic coupling effects. As a result, particle oscillations are inevitable and cannot be effectively compensated by predesigned acoustic trapping. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel visual feedback control approach that dynamically adjusts the acoustic field distribution to mitigate oscillations along the z-axis of the acoustic trapping. A binocular microscopic vision system is employed for precise particle localization, while a disturbance observer estimates the effects of strong nonlinearity and uncertainties of the acoustic trapping. The proposed methodology is validated through simulations and experiments, demonstrating a significant reduction in z-axis oscillations from 1.33× wavelength to within 0.03× wavelength. This advancement marks a step forward in achieving precise and complex acoustic manipulation using traveling-wave acoustic tweezers."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy, coupled with the urgent need to reduce the carbon footprint of fossil-based electricity generation, has driven the development of renewable energy sources and advanced digital control systems. One promising innovation is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading, which transforms end consumers into active participants capable of producing, storing, and trading energy within a localized cluster. This study proposes an optimization model to enhance energy efficiency and economic benefits for end consumers by leveraging photovoltaic (PV) generation, Energy Storage Systems (ESS), and Electric Vehicless (EVs) within a smart home environment. In the first stage, the impact of PV alone, and PV combined with ESS, on household energy management is analyzed. In the second stage, the model is extended to examine the performance of P2P energy trading across various cluster configurations. The proposed model is implemented in Python, solved using the Gurobi optimizer, and evaluated under realistic scenarios. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both cost savings and energy utilization for end consumers, highlighting the effectiveness and flexibility of P2P markets and smart energy management systems in promoting renewable energy adoption."

    "abstract": "The healthcare sector has been transformed by the high uptake of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) as it has allowed real-time monitoring of patients, early detection and health provision at long distances. Nevertheless, the widespread network interconnectedness of the IoMT devices has also augmented the risk of cyberattacks in an alarming manner, putting grave challenges on patient data confidentiality, integrity and availability. The very design of IoMT devices interferes with traditional security solutions exacerbating shortcomings in computing capabilities and energy efficiency. To overcome these issues, this research paper suggests that a new framework to provide security in communication among IoMT devices called Adaptive Intrusion Detection Framework (AIDF) should be created. The proposed system is a combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the best features selection and Lightweight Deep Neural Network (LDNN) in a good intrusion classification and the least use of resources. The AIDF was tested on a hybrid data set that contains network traffic characteristics and biomed-ical sensor data with an improved outcome of 97.2 percent detection accuracy compared to conventional machine learning models used to detect different categories of intrusions, such as DoS, probing, and data theft. This fact is confirmed by the comprehensive validation through experimental results indicating the robustness, scalability and suitability of the proposed method in real-time IoMT settings, where secured and dependable healthcare infrastructures of communication are provided."

Our sensor uses LEDs to sense the displacement between two plates connected by a transparent elastomer; when a force is applied to the finger, the elastomer displaces and the LED signals change. We show that using LEDs as both light emitters and receivers in this context provides high sensitivity, allowing such an emitter and receiver pairs to detect very small displacements. We characterize the standalone performance of the sensor by testing the ability of a supervised learning model to predict complete force and torque data from its raw signals, and obtain a mean error between 0.05 and 0.07 N across the three directions of force applied to the finger. Our method allows for compact packaging (fitting at the base of a finger) with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, easy integration into a complete hand, and high overload shear forces and bending torques, suggesting future applicability to complete manipulation tasks."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical challenge of enhancing data throughput in CubeSat communication systems, which are limited by possible onboard power. The study proposes a novel solution for DVB-S2X standard by replacing the conventional Root-Raised Cosine (RRC) pulses with optimal signals with joint application of Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. The synthesized optimal signals are designed to minimize out-of-band emissions under restrictions on BER performance taking into account characteristics of APSK modulations used in DVB-S2X. A digital test bench was developed to simulate a CubeSat downlink scenario, comparing the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed optimal signals against traditional RRC pulses at increased symbol rates. The optimal signals can provide double symbol rate (from 1/T to 2/T) with energy loss equal to 0.05 dB for QPSK and 0.55 dB for 64APSK compared to a standard RRC signals without increased symbol rate. This result leads to potential downlink data rates of up to 2.4 Gbps in a 500 MHz band, making highthroughput CubeSat communications feasible under strict power budgets. The research concludes that optimal signals are a potent method for drastically increasing the data rate of DVB-S2X-based CubeSat modems without a proportional increase in transmitter power."

However, these solvers remain heavily robot-dependent, where for each robot of interest, a network needs to be trained in an one-solver-one-robot framework. In this paper, we build on our previous work on Learning-By-Example (LBE) for DDIK, and introduce an one-solver-many-robots framework; where a single neural network is used to predict the IK of multiple robots – mainly with 6 and 7 Degrees of Freedom (DoF). In our LBE approach, the neural network input includes an example of joint-pose tuple (e.g. any previous joint and corresponding pose tuple in the path) along with the queried pose as the same network outputs the desired robot joint configuration. Here, we investigate five network architectures: a Plain Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Residual-Based MLP (RMLP), a Densely Connected MLP (DMLP), and two transformers inspired by Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) and tested them using 3 diverse datasets with 20 real-world robotic arms with 6 and 7 DoF. Our experimental results demonstrate that a single lightweight, LBE-based DDIK solver can reliably predict the IK for multiple and hitherto unseen robots, within each of the 6 or 7DoF family as well as across both 6 and 7DoF robot families with position errors below 1mm and orientation errors below 1deg. Additionally, we compare all proposed LBE-DDIK solvers with three established numerical IK solvers: Selectively Damped Least-Squares (SD), Singular Value Filtering (SVF), and Mixed Inverse (MX) and observe that our LBE-DDIK solvers achieve comparable accuracy, with the advantage of being a one-solver-many-robots framework."

Building on this, we systematically analyzed the structural stability of the tetrahedral nanorobot using multiple simulation methods. We then fabricated the specific molecule-triggered tetrahedral DNA nanorobot with high structural stability and efficient drug delivery capacity. The proposed nanorobot was further employed for the recognition and inhibition of circulating tumor cells.

Building on Learning from Hallucination (LfH), which synthesizes training data from past successful navigation experiences in simpler environments, Dyna-LfLH incorporates dynamic obstacles by generating them through a learned latent distribution. This enables efficient and safe motion planner training.

While existing methods predominantly concentrate on local features surrounding the keypoints of the support image, they often overlook the importance of global features, leading to potential misalignment between the support and query image. To address the inherent conflicts between the two images, we propose AlignCAPE, a novel approach designed to mitigate such misalignment and enhance the model performance. Our method formulates a two-stage pipeline, generating initial proposals in the first stage, followed by another stage to refine iteratively. Specifically, we introduce two modules, Feature Alignment Module(FAM) and Keypoint Perception Module(KPM). FAM utilizes bidirectional cross-attention operation to align the support image feature and query image feature, thereby compensating for the limitations of previous methods. KPM employs self-attention mechanism to capture the interactions among keypoints, facilitating to localize keypoints in the query image. Experiments on MP-100 benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms the widely-used baseline model in CAPE by 0.68% in PCK@0.2 metric under 1-shot setting."

The model is designed to capture dynamic features at different temporal resolutions, enhance focus on key risk factors, and maintain training stability in complex financial data environments. Using the US Systemic Risk Dataset released by the Federal Reserve, the model transforms the task into a binary classification problem based on crisis-related indicators. All time series data are standardized, interpolated, and structured through sliding windows to preserve temporal continuity. Experimental comparisons show that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods such as MLP, CNN, Transformer, and BERT across accuracy, precision, and recall. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of multi-scale and attention mechanisms in modeling complex dependencies and detecting early risk signals. Sensitivity experiments on convolutional kernel size demonstrate that integrating cross-feature information significantly improves performance, with 3x3 and 5x3 kernels showing optimal results. The training process exhibits fast convergence and low loss stability, confirming the model's robustness and efficiency. These findings validate the technical advantages of the proposed architecture in addressing the challenges of systemic risk modeling in high-dimensional and heterogeneous financial time series."

    "abstract": "The conditional coding paradigm is widely used in learned video compression, which shows superior performance in capturing redundancies within a large context space. However, existing Conditional coding-based Learned Video Compression (C-LVC) methods ignore that the predicted motion vectors usually contain large uncertainty due to complex motions, occlusions, etc., which consequently decrease the accuracy of the generated temporal contexts. In addition, existing C-LVC methods have a weak ability to mine diverse dependencies within the context space, which are closely related to the coding efficiency. To address these issues, an efficient temporal redundancy mining method is proposed to improve the coding efficiency of C-LVC in this paper. To generate accurate temporal contexts, a Long Short-Term Motion Aggregation (LSTMA) model is proposed, in which an LSTMA-based motion estimation module is developed to capture both current and aggregated long short-term motion information to reduce the uncertainty of predicted motion vectors. Based on the dual motion information, an LSTMA-based temporal context mining module is developed to exploit the aggregated long short-term motion information and increase the accuracy of the generated temporal contexts. In order to fully eliminate spatial-temporal redundancies in a video, a Global-Local Information Decorrelation Module (GLIDM)-based context codec is proposed, in which the GLIDM is designed based on the visual state space block (namely vmamba), the residual block, and the squeeze-and-excitation block to effectively capture long-range, short-range spatial-temporal dependencies and channel-wise dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively improve the coding performance of C-LVC, and outperforms other state-of-the-art LVC methods."

    "abstract": "The practical application of aerial-aquatic robots is hindered by severe impact loads during water entry. Existing load reduction methods are inefficient for robots requiring rapid, high-frequency aerial-aquatic transitions. Therefore, this study proposes an active learning based joint optimization framework for nose profiles and water-entry strategies, which is fully automated. Specifically, an 8-dimensional parameter space is defined for generating dataset inputs through Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Furthermore, a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) surrogate model is trained under different water-entry strategies, in order to predict peak impact loads and quantify prediction uncertainty for varying nose profiles. Within each active learning loop, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) guides the selective labelling of samples to expand the dataset, and the DKL model is iteratively retrained until convergence. Compared against state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach reduces the number of required high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to 65% of that of the comparison methods, while achieving maximum reductions of 66.9% in axial and 72.8% in normal impact loads across the parameter space, respectively. Notably, under the water-entry strategies employed by the hunting behavior of gannets, the approach yields profiles closely matching the skull morphology of the northern gannet. In this case, this work not only delivers an efficient and reliable impact loads reduction solution for aerial-aquatic robots, but also reveals the role of natural selection in minimizing such loads."

    "abstract": "Active gate driving enables the shaping of switching waveforms in power devices, helping to mitigate overshoot and ringing. With the advent of smart, open-loop, programmable gate drivers, selecting gate control parameters is challenging, and testing these in hardware is time-consuming and potentially risky. This paper proposes a faster, safer simulation-based method for optimising gate current profiles, requiring high-fidelity device models. A commercial model is modified using measured device properties, specifically input capacitance, recovery charge, and high-voltage transfer behaviour, whilst experimental switching waveforms are reserved exclusively for validation, not model tuning. Gate profile optimisation begins with a measured gate current waveform, then modulates the current within a limited time window in simulation. Profiles are evaluated for overshoot, ringing and switching loss. The most promising are validated experimentally using a 1200 V, 17 A SiC MOSFET in an 800 V, 10 A half-bridge with a custom single-chip active gate driver capable of synthesising arbitrary current waveforms. To further assess robustness, power loop inductance is varied. The modified model shows good agreement with measurements, and the optimised gate profiles supress 180 MHz turn-on current ringing by 7 dB and reduce turn-off voltage overshoot by 20%, without increasing switching losses. This work demonstrates computationally efficient gate profile optimisation, with strong potential for application in smart gate drivers."

    "abstract": "Conventional single LiDAR systems are inherently constrained by their limited field of view (FoV), leading to blind spots and incomplete environmental awareness, particularly on robotic platforms with strict payload limitations. Integrating a motorized LiDAR offers a practical solution by significantly expanding the sensor’s FoV and enabling adaptive panoramic 3D sensing. However, the high-frequency vibrations of the quadruped robot introduce calibration challenges: these oscillations continually disturb the LiDAR–motor extrinsics, so parameters calibrated once may drift during operation and degrade sensing accuracy.Existing calibration methods that use artificial targets or dense feature extraction lack feasibility for on-site applications and real-time implementation. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiMo-Calib, an efficient on-site calibration method that eliminates the need for external targets by leveraging geometric features directly from raw LiDAR scans. LiMo-Calib optimizes feature selection based on normal distribution to accelerate convergence while maintaining accuracy and incorporates a reweighting mechanism that evaluates local plane fitting quality to enhance robustness. We integrate and validate the proposed method on a motorized LiDAR system mounted on a quadruped robot, demonstrating significant improvements in calibration efficiency and 3D sensing accuracy, making LiMo-Calib well-suited for real-world robotic applications. We further demonstrate the accuracy improvements of the Lidar Inertial Odometry (LIO) on the panoramic 3D sensing system using the calibrated parameters.

    "abstract": "Grid-connected inverters (GCIs) can operate in both grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) modes. However, GFL control tends to be unstable in weak grids, whereas GFM control is prone to resonance in strong grids. Recently, a hybrid control strategy based on the equivalent parallel connection of a GFL inverter and a GFM inverter has been proposed. Nevertheless, it still struggles to maintain stable operation across a wide range of short-circuit ratios (SCRs). This paper proposes a novel hybrid control based on the linear active disturbance rejection controller (LADRC). The LADRC-based approach effectively suppresses the circulating currents between the GFL and GFM controllers. The state-space model of the LADRC-based hybrid control is established, and the impact of control parameters on the eigenvalues of the proposed hybrid control is analyzed. Through the design of LADRC, the proposed hybrid control can achieve stable operation under both weak and strong grids. The grid current harmonic disturbance rejection capability is enhanced, and the voltage support ability is also maintained. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed LADRC-based hybrid control."

    "abstract": "Brain-inspired vision sensors (BVSs), drawing inspiration from the human visual system, produce sparse, high-temporal-resolution data stream capable of capturing rapid object motion. However, real-time processing of such data while preserving its inherent sparsity presents a critical challenge for practical deployment. A key challenge is to leverage the spatiotemporal correlations among event stream. Overlooking these correlations leads to prohibitively high query costs that even negate the benefits of sparsity, while exploiting them introduces complications such as input-output order conflicts and trade-offs between memory usage and latency. To address this, we present Espresso, an efficient hardware architecture that leverages the spatiotemporal order of events while explicitly preserving sparsity, achieving low-latency stream processing of event data. We first formalize a spatiotemporal order representation that identifies key features for stream processing on sparse events. Building on this, Espresso decouples output window address from input event address, resolving order conflicts via a dedicated queue mechanism and minimizing memory overhead through an optimized hash table. This enables immediate window-wise processing with minimal latency. To coordinate the pipeline, we design the Event-Scheduler, a streamlined finite state machine that prunes computations on zero values and aligns input-output stream order discrepancies. Integrated together, these modules deliver scalable, high-throughput processing for event-driven vision tasks. Espresso achieves up to 5000 fps, offering a 5.1× performance improvement over embedded GPUs. With parallel instantiations, it exceeds over 7000 fps in structured scenes and maintains over 2000 fps under complex-environment scenarios with minimal hardware overhead. These results establish Espresso as an efficient and scalable solution for real-time event-based vision processing, demonstrating the importance of spatiotemporal ordering in unlocking the full potential of BVSs."

An FIM consists of multiple elements deposited on a flexible substrate. These elements can not only transmit signals, but also adapt their displacements in a direction perpendicular to the FIM surface via an attached controller. In this paper, we consider the channel estimation problem for the uplink of an FIM-enhanced communication system via customizing the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the column coherence of the measurement matrix by optimizing the FIM's surface shape, subject to the morphing range constraint. Based on the estimated direction of arrival (DOA) and channel gain, we further investigate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement in the FIM-enhanced downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system. Numerical results demonstrate that an FIM significantly outperforms a conventional rigid uniform planar array (UPA), thereby showing that FIM can substantially improve channel estimation accuracy and achieve SNR improvement, even when using estimated channel parameters."

However, open-phase faults (OPFs) in the motor can distort the observed back electromotive forces (EMFs), hindering the accurate estimation of the rotor position. The observed back EMF distortion is induced by the incorrect transmission of the voltage signal in the faulty phase based on the analysis. A sliding mode observer (SMO) is proposed based on dual d-q coordinate transformation to avoid the distortion of the observed EMFs in case of OPFs. The coupling between 2 sets of three-phase windings are also considered in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the method can accurately estimate the rotor position under OPF."

Na primeira, o OSD assume que não tem poder de alterar os preços de equilíbrio do mercado atacadista, enquanto que na segunda, o OSD assume que a flexibilidade de demanda da ADL, em função de seus recursos de energia distribuídos (REDs), podem alterar os preços do mercado atacadista. Neste trabalho investigou-se modelos propostos na literatura através de uma metodologia desenvolvida para avaliar a qualidade dos lances calculados pelo OSD e concluiu-se que a interação ativa, que leva em conta no modelo as opções do OST, proporciona o cálculo de lances com preços mais ajustados à demanda real da ADL e um despacho mais eficiente dos REDs."

However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these, relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as \"more to the left\") offers a good balance between usability and information richness. Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user’s preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting."

In contrast, this study focuses on inconsistencies at the blockchain protocol level. We analyze how network partitions, which may arise from robots’ local-only communication capabilities, malfunctioning hardware, or external attacks, can lead to inconsistent information in a robot swarm. In order to mitigate these disruptions, we propose a decentralized approach to detect partitions and a corresponding response.

A key challenge is information asymmetry: the student cannot directly access the teacher’s state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher —querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states —to stay on a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods: (i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration. We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines in training efficiency and final performance.

    "abstract": "Robust and accurate localization and mapping of an environment using laser scanners, so-called LiDAR SLAM, is essential to many robotic applications. Early 3D LiDAR SLAM methods often exploited additional information from IMU or GNSS sensors to enhance localization accuracy and mitigate drift. Later, advanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher runtime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved with a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the \"Keep It Small and Simple\" (KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalist design principle, our system, KISS-SLAM, achieves state-of-the-art performance in pose accuracy while requiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse environments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in graph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion between scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we match local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step. The experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive performance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor modalities. By prioritizing simplicity, this work provides a new strong baseline for LiDAR-only SLAM and a high-performing starting point for future research. Furthermore, our pipeline builds consistent maps that can be used directly for downstream tasks like navigation. Our open-source system operates faster than the sensor frame rate in all presented datasets and is designed for real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "The autonomous navigation of robotic systems is one of the main problems of this industry today. Due to the simplicity of its implementation and the ability to follow trajectories, the Pure Pursuit controller has become a handy and popular tool among researchers. However, the controller's performance depends directly on the adjustment of its parameters, which must be selected following the track's characteristics. This study investigates the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm application for automatically tuning multiple parameters within the Pure Pursuit controller, to improve trajectory tracking accuracy on a complex closed-loop circuit. For this purpose, the track is segmented according to the smoothness of the curves present, and the controller parameters are automatically adjusted according to the characteristics of each segment. The results of this work show that segmentwise parameter optimization of a Pure Pursuit controller using the PSO algorithm enables the vehicle to successfully complete complex tracks, whereas both empirical and globally optimized fixed-parameter configurations fail early in the trajectory. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory tracking accuracy, suggesting that PSO-based parameter optimization can be a valuable tool for enhancing the performance of Pure Pursuit controllers in real-world autonomous navigation applications."

Then in practice, we refactor three crucial components through GS, to leverage its explicit scene representation and real-time rendering: (1) choosing the 2D neural Gaussian representation for physics-compliant scene and sensor modeling, (2) proposing a scene editing pipeline to leverage Gaussian primitives library for data augmentation, and (3) coupling a controllable diffusion model for scene expansion and harmonization. We implement this framework on a proprietary autonomous driving dataset supporting cameras and LiDAR sensors. We demonstrate through ablation studies that our approach reduces frame-wise simulation latency, achieves better geometric and photometric consistency, and enables interpretable explicit scene editing and expansion.

    "abstract": "Micro-robots are emerging as powerful tools for search-and-rescue, precision agriculture, and cooperative manipulation, where their small size and low cost offer advantages over larger robots. However, enabling autonomous navigation on these robots remains challenging due to severe hardware constraints, such as limited memory, energy, and computational power. We explore a brain-inspired learning paradigm called Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to equip a cheap, lightweight navigation model that runs onboard micro-robots. We present NavHD, which features an adaptive HD encoder that learns spatial representations and incorporates loss-based training for both imitation learning and off-policy reinforcement learning. Our hardware implementation of NavHD uses eight ultrasound sensors and is optimized to run on an ARM Cortex-M4 core, using only 10.2 kB of memory, 900 clock cycles and 1.1 mJ of energy per inference. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that NavHD outperforms DNN-based and prior HDC-based RL methods in obstacle avoidance by more than 2x the performance, while achieving 2-26x more superior resource efficiency."

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM) demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21% faster inference speed and 63% FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our findings reveal that over 60% of spatial tokens contribute minimally (<5%) to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D multimodal learning."

Based on ns-3 simulations, we assess the impact of network size and downlink ACKs from confirmed uplink packets on packet success ratio and energy consumption.Results show that S-ALOHA and S-ALOHA/CSMA do not consistently outperform pure ALOHA in practice, contrary to theoretical expectations. Moreover, while TDMA eliminates collisions in unconfirmed traffic, it performs poorly with confirmed traffic. Our findings highlight the difficulty of enhancing LoRaWAN through time slotted channel access without compromising standard compliance, particularly given the overhead of synchronization mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in open-world outdoor environments faces challenges in integrating dynamic conditions, long-distance spatial reasoning, and semantic understanding. Traditional methods struggle to balance local planning, global planning, and semantic task execution, while existing large language models (LLMs) enhance semantic comprehension but lack spatial reasoning capabilities. Although diffusion models excel in local optimization, they fall short in large-scale long-distance navigation. To address these gaps, this paper proposes KiteRunner, a language-driven cooperative local-global navigation strategy that combines UAV orthophoto-based global planning with diffusion model-driven local path generation for long-distance navigation in open-world scenarios. Our method innovatively leverages real-time UAV orthophotography to construct a global probability map, providing traversability guidance for the local planner, while integrating large models like CLIP and GPT to interpret natural language instructions. Experiments demonstrate that KiteRunner achieves 5.6% and 12.8% improvements in path efficiency over state-of-the-art methods in structured and unstructured environments, respectively, with significant reductions in human interventions and execution time."

It enables high-precision and robust real-time state estimation and map construction in challenging environments, such as LiDAR-degraded, low-texture regions, and feature-scarce areas. The LPVIMO-SAM comprises two subsystems: a polarized vision-inertial system and a LiDAR/Inertial/Magnetometer/Optical Flow System. The polarized vision enhances the robustness of the Visual/Inertial odometry in low-feature and low-texture scenarios by extracting the polarization information of the scene. The magnetometer acquires the heading angle, and the optical flow obtains the speed and height to reduce the accumulated error. A magnetometer heading prior factor, an optical flow speed observation factor, and a height observation factor are designed to eliminate the cumulative errors of the LiDAR/Inertial odometry through factor graph optimization. Meanwhile, the LPVIMO-SAM can maintain stable positioning even when one of the two subsystems fails, further expanding its applicability in LiDAR-degraded, low-texture, and low-feature environments. Our comparative experiments against existing algorithms reveals that achieves a 43.4% reduction in localization root mean square error relative to LVI-SAM, demonstrating significant precision improvements."

We propose a trajectory planner that quickly determines how to grasp and precisely assemble customized products in reconfigurable environment. Inspired by voting and global registration methods, our strategy reduces false positives and enhances object identification accuracy, even with vastly different point cloud scales. We present an image processing technique combining best-fit and iterative closest point methods to improve system robustness, adaptability, and stability for objects of varying shapes, sizes, and materials, achieving millimeter-level 3D localization with millions of scene points. An enhanced tree method manages uneven 3D space distribution, enabling fast collision-free planning. A space configuration algorithm minimizes computational load, supporting complex tasks like liquid handling. After digital twin verification of collision-free paths, the robotic arm executes assembly tasks. This approach is validated through Lego assembly and other industrial use cases."

By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation, the proposed approach captures the physical dynamics of the converter while preserving analytical tractability. The resulting nonlinear model is systematically linearized to enable the design of an optimal state-space controller. To enhance performance and reduce tuning effort, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to automatically determine the weighting matrices of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). The PSO-tuned controller significantly improves dynamic response and robustness under varying operating conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the energy-based model and the effectiveness of the optimized control strategy in minimizing output voltage deviation during transients, outperforming conventional averaged models.

    "abstract": "In contrast to single-skill tasks, long-horizon tasks play a crucial role in our daily life, e.g., a pouring task requires a proper concatenation of reaching, grasping and pouring subtasks. As an efficient solution for transferring human skills to robots, imitation learning has achieved great progress over the last two decades. However, when learning long-horizon visuomotor skills, imitation learning often demands a large amount of semantically segmented demonstrations. Moreover, the performance of imitation learning could be susceptible to external perturbation and visual occlusion. In this paper, we exploit dynamical movement primitives and meta-learning to provide a new framework for imitation learning, called Meta-Imitation Learning with Adaptive Dynamical Primitives (MiLa). MiLa allows for learning unsegmented long-horizon demonstrations and adapting to unseen tasks with a single demonstration. MiLa can also resist external disturbances and visual occlusion during task execution. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the superiority of MiLa, irrespective of visual occlusion and random perturbations on robots."

    "abstract": "Humans possess delicate dynamic balance mechanisms that enable them to maintain stability across diverse terrains and under extreme conditions. However, despite significant advances recently, existing locomotion algorithms for humanoid robots are still struggle to traverse extreme environments, especially in cases that lack external perception (e.g., vision or LiDAR). This is because current methods often rely on gait-based or perception-condition rewards, lacking effective mechanisms to handle unobservable obstacles and sudden balance loss. To address this challenge, we propose a novel whole-body locomotion algorithm based on dynamic balance and Reinforcement Learning (RL) that enables humanoid robots to traverse extreme terrains, particularly narrow pathways and unexpected obstacles, using only proprioception. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic balance mechanism by leveraging a novel Zero Moment Point (ZMP)-driven reward and task-driven rewards in a whole-body actor-critic framework, aiming to achieve coordinated actions of the upper and lower limbs for robust locomotion. Experiments conducted on a full-sized Unitree H1-2 robot verify the ability of our method to maintain balance on extremely narrow terrains and under external disturbances, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the robot's adaptability to complex environments.

    "abstract": "This paper explores nudge schemes for a central regulator aimed at incentivizing players in constrained noncooperative games to reach desired equilibria. Unlike traditional intervention mechanisms where players update their actions by blindly following signals from the regulator, the nudge mechanism comprehensively integrates players’ rational judgment by incorporating trust variables into players’ models. This implies that players update their actions by evaluating the signals from the regulator and their own expectations to the incentive mechanisms. If the regulator’s signals significantly deviate from the players’ expectations, players decrease trust in the regulator and rely more on the their expectations when updating their actions. Conversely, if the signals align closely with their expectations, players tend to increase trust in the regulator and place greater emphasis on the regulator’s signals. It should be noted that each player does not have access to other players’ actions, which means that it updates its action in a distributed manner by only observing the actions of its neighbors through a directed balanced graph. Furthermore, static and dynamic nudges are designed based on different information available to the regulator, which are also extended to an online case with the desired equilibrum being time-varying. Finally, an application to the robot formation control is shown to validate the obtained results."

Under such situations, auditory information can play a crucial role in locating victims who are not visible. Existing drone audition research has demonstrated the feasibility of detecting sound sources using onboard microphone arrays. However, most studies focus on single-drone systems, which face limitations in coverage and accessibility, particularly in complex environments such as collapsed buildings or urban canyons. Additionally, real-world validation of multi-drone audition systems remains limited, with prior studies relying primarily on simulations or controlled environments. To address these challenges, we propose and evaluate a Multi-Drone and Robot-Based Active Audition System (SAAS-RD: Swarm Active Audition System with Robots and Drones) that integrates multiple drones and ground robots to enhance acoustic search capabilities. Our work focuses on real-world performance validation, conducting field experiments in outdoor environments and analyzing system feasibility through case studies.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose SAGENet that utilizes only binaural echoes (i.e., for scenarios when vision perception seriously degrades) for scene depth estimation. Unlike previous methods that implicitly learn spatial features from echoes, which may cause shape and scale drift, SAGENet explicitly extracts spatial cues, effectively enhancing depth estimation accuracy. First, we leverage signal processing to generate coarse 2D geometric cues, which contain scene scale and shape information, as additional input for the 3D depth estimation network. This approach aids the network in better reconstructing depth information from the scene. Given the substantial noise in the 2D geometric cues, we design a geometric cue consistency denoising loss function to help the network accurately interpret the scale and shape information embedded in the features. Second, we initialize learnable queries with angular spectrum peaks and fuse them with audio features via self-attention to guide the network to focus on the first few reflections echo dominant feature, while effectively suppressing interference from reverberation. Finally, Our experimental results on the Replica and real-world BatVision datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the existing binaural echo-based methods (including BatVision) by more than 5% and 10% in absolute relative error, respectively. To benefit the community, we open-source the code at https://github.com/zjuersdsd/SAGENet.git."

Besides it considers the influence of capacitance-voltage dependence on the losses in transistor during switching."

    "abstract": "In this article, we address the problem of collaborative task assignment, sequencing, and multi-agent pathfinding (TSPF), where a team of agents must visit a set of task locations without collisions while minimizing flowtime. TSPF incorporates agent-task compatibility constraints and ensures that all tasks are completed. We propose a Conflict-Based Search with Task Sequencing (CBS-TS), an optimal and complete algorithm that alternates between finding new task sequences and resolving conflicts in the paths of current sequences. CBS-TS uses a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize task sequencing and employs Conflict-Based Search (CBS) with Multi-Label A* (MLA*) for collision-free path planning within a search forest. By invoking MILP for the next-best sequence only when needed, CBS-TS efficiently limits the search space, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining optimality.We compare the performance of our CBS-TS against Conflict-based Steiner Search (CBSS), a baseline method that, with minor modifications, can address the TSPF problem. Experimental results demonstrate that CBS-TS outperforms CBSS in most testing scenarios, achieving higher success rates and consistently optimal solutions, whereas CBSS achieves near-optimal solutions in some cases.

We first frame the motion planning task as a constrained optimization problem, which is relaxed to be an unconstrained optimization problem that can be locally solved via a gradient flow approach using functional analysis. To enforce constraints, the proposed GPIF augments the gradient flow dynamics with proportional and integral feedback terms. Under reasonable assumptions formulated as linear matrix inequalities, we prove that the GPIF can generate optimal control trajectories with guaranteed exponential convergence. Numerical simulations validate the algorithm's efficacy, focusing on simple car navigation in cluttered environments. Simulations show that even after discretization for practical implementation, the GPIF method retains computational efficiency, enabling both offline planning and real-time online execution."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of smart farming towards large-scale livestock operations, the demand for model generalization in cross-pen behavior recognition has significantly increased. Traditional deep learning models suffer from substantial performance degradation due to variations in illumination and structure across different sheep pens, often necessitating the re-annotation of tens of thousands of frames for each new environment to mitigate domain shift issues. This severely limits the deployment of models in large-scale sheep farms. To achieve the goal of ’annotate once, generalize across pens,’ we propose the SheepDA-YOLO framework, which innovatively integrates contrastive image translation and feature decoupling to address cross-domain adaptation challenges in agriculture. The core of our method consists of four parts: generating bidirectional pseudo-images for source and target domains based on CUT method to reduce image-level domain discrepancies through mixed training sets; employing a Mean Teacher architecture combined with a quadruple loss function to ensure stable knowledge transfer; proposing DP-DMAF module, which suppresses illumination interference and feature confusion through dual-path feature decoupling and separable large-kernel attention, complemented by a high-resolution detection layer to enhance small-target recognition accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that SheepDA-YOLO achieves 89.7% mAP in cross-domain testing on target sheep pens, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 3.4% and significantly reducing annotation costs. The study is the first to validate the feasibility of cross-pen adaptation, providing an efficient solution for the scalable implementation of smart livestock farming."

This study investigates a solution to enhance power transmission capacity by converting an existing AC line to HVDC. The chosen AC line is a $115-\\mathrm{kV}$ line of PG&E utility in California. A DC line is designed to replace the existing AC line while using the same conductors as the existing AC line. The results obtained from MATLAB Simulink simulation show that the DC line can provide a 45.6% increase in the power carrying capacity compared to that of the existing AC line if suitable measures are implemented to maintain the system voltage limits. The finding contributes to the development of HVDC lines for enhancing power grid transmission capacity without having to build new power lines. This, in turn, potentially provides economic savings to power utilities while protecting the environment."

Applying LSTM and GRU models with feature extraction is followed by an accurate feature selection process utilizing methods like chi-square selector, ANOVA, mutual information metrics, variance-based selection, and feature agglomeration. This technique aims to improve the feature set by excluding redundant features that only the most important features are employed for model training. The developed feature set is then used to train various ML models, including Support Vector Classification (SVC), k-nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

    "abstract": "Dexterous telemanipulation critically relies on the continuous and stable tracking of the human operator’s commands to ensure robust operation. Vison-based tracking methods are widely used but have low stability due to anomalies such as occlusions, inadequate lighting, and loss of sight. Traditional filtering, regression, and interpolation methods are commonly used to compensate for explicit information such as angles and positions. These approaches are restricted to low-dimensional data and often result in information loss compared to the original high-dimensional image and video data. Recent advances in diffusion-based approaches, which can operate on high-dimensional data, have achieved remarkable success in video reconstruction and generation. However, these methods have not been fully explored in continuous control tasks in robotics. This work introduces the Diffusion-Enhanced Telemanipulation (DET) framework, which incorporates the Frame-Difference Detection (FDD) technique to identify and segment anomalies in video streams. These anomalous clips are replaced after reconstruction using diffusion models, ensuring robust telemanipulation performance under challenging visual conditions. We validated this approach in various anomaly scenarios and compared it with the baseline methods. Experiments show that DET achieves an average RMSE reduction of 17.2% compared to the cubic spline and 51.1% compared to FFT-based interpolation for different occlusion durations."

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a rudimentary problem for robotic perception systems and downstream applications. However, depth estimation from a single image is an inherently ill-posed problem due to data loss related to projection from 3D to 2D. Recent studies address the discrepancy between camera parameters by using learning-based methods and unifying the camera model to canonical camera space or bipolar representations, thus addressing the problem of training a metric depth model over different datasets with different camera parameters. In addition, the previous study, OrchardDepth, introduced the sparse-dense depth consistency loss function to learn the dense depth distribution through the city autonomous driving scene to improve model performance in the orchard. Instead of enforcing strict consistency between the sparse and dense depth, this work introduced the KL divergence to encourage the network to adapt to the depth distributions of different sensors and penalize deviations from reliable regions while tolerating errors in unreliable areas. Furthermore, we further enhance the depth consistency loss by integrating bins into the supervised discretised depth distribution. This method significantly improves the robustness and performance of our previous method. In addition, it improves the absolute relative error in the orchard dataset by 17.3% and 16.2% in contrast to SILog Loss and OrchardDepth baseline, respectively. Thus enhancing the new training paradigm for depth estimation in the orchard scene."

The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot."

Experimental results demonstrate successful J-turn execution across multiple vehicle models through textual prompts that adapt to differing vehicle dynamics. We evaluate performance via established success criteria and discuss limitations regarding numeric precision and scenario complexity. Our findings underscore the potential of LLM-driven control for high-agility maneuvers, while highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches that combine language-based reasoning with algorithmic validation.

Pseudo resistor circuits are used in sensor system filters. The problem is to achieve extremely high resistance values (hundreds of MOhms) within a minimal chip area. This is achieved by using MOS transistors that are biased in the weak inversion region. This enables the implementation of high-resistance, compact-layout pseudo resistors. The study focuses on designing and simulating the most common pseudo resistor circuits without gate control voltage. The effects of transistor width and length, as well as the number of cells connected in series, on resistance and occupied area were analysed. It was found that increasing transistor length increases resistance, while increasing width decreases it. Furthermore, temperature simulations revealed a strong dependence, with resistance decreasing significantly as temperature rises. The results obtained confirm the feasibility of using pseudo resistors in low-pass filters for sensor systems. For filters with a passband in the tens of kilohertz range, pseudo resistors based on minimum-length transistors with limited width were shown to be optimal."

These vulnerabilities introduce critical clinical risks, as poisoned models can result in flawed diagnoses or treatment recommendations. This work offers a detailed theoretical assessment of adversarial attacks in medical FL, introducing a new taxonomy organized by attack vectors and system layers. A multi-layer threat model is introduced to describe vulnerabilities throughout the FL pipeline, with a mapping of targeted defense strategies like robust aggregation, differential privacy, and anomaly detection. The paper is wrapped up with the observation of major open research questions, such as the intersection of interpretability and security, FL robustness certification, and synthetic data's role.

First, the proposed method employs a Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid velocity using local observations. The predicted velocity is then incorporated into a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to compensate for the predicted fluid velocity, thereby optimizing the micro-robot’s performance. A series of simulation studies and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the Mamba Policy excels on the Adroit, Dexart, and MetaWorld datasets, requiring significantly fewer computational resources. Additionally, we highlight the Mamba Policy’s enhanced robustness in long-horizon scenarios compared to baseline methods and explore the performance of various Mamba variants within the Mamba Policy framework.

In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to walk from a few real-world demonstrations."

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the spatio-temporal areas restoration problem for a single robot when faced with state uncertainty: a robot, with limited battery life, deployed in a known environment, persistently plans a schedule to visit areas of interest and charge its battery as needed. The temporal properties of areas decay over time, wherein the decay is only partially observable and evolves over time, potentially with correlation among areas. The goal is to restore the temporal properties so that the time the measured property values are below a certain threshold is minimized.Our previous work formulated the spatio-temporal areas restoration problem assuming that the decays are known. Instead, in this paper, we relax that assumption and account for the uncertainty, proposing a heuristic to measure the discounted opportunity cost of a visit, which induces risk-aversion to revisit overlooked areas, and adding a component that learns the decay parameters in each area as well as potential correlation among areas. The learning component can then be used to predict future trends and be incorporated in the heuristic forecast. Moreover, the algorithm learns and constantly adjusts for noise that can happen during mission. We show in experiments using a robotics simulator that our devised approach is able to maintain areas above the critical threshold better than existing state-of-the-art methods from related problems. This contribution enables a robot to come up with an effective schedule efficiently for preserving spatio-temporal properties of an environment considering realistic scenarios–which has markedly impact in important environmental applications."

Existing resolved-rate motion control (RRMC) methods formulate obstacle avoidance as a quadratic programming (QP) problem.

In this work, we propose the Mode-Isolated Velocity-Guide (MIVG) algorithm that deploys a dual-mode isolation strategy combined with a Velocity-Guide Potential Field (VGPF). This novel approach separates obstacle avoidance from target-driven tasks while providing velocity-based directional guidance. Simulations on a 7-degree-of-freedom Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances task success rates while maintaining real-time feasibility, achieving an increase in execution success rates of 35.0% ~ 52.0% compared to the baseline RRMC strategy (NEO).

While haptic feedback in VR enhances immersive experience, its effect on virtual walking behavior in dense and dynamic pedestrian flows is unknown. Through a user study, we investigated how haptic feedback changes user walking motion in crowded pedestrian flows in VR. The results indicate that haptic feedback changed users’ collision avoidance movements, as measured by increased walking trajectory length and change in pelvis angle. The displacements of users’ lateral position and pelvis angle were also increased in the instantaneous response to a collision with a non-player character (NPC), even when the NPC was inside the field of view. Haptic feedback also enhanced users’ awareness and visual exploration when an NPC approached from the side or back. Furthermore, variation in walking speed was increased by the haptic feedback. These results suggest that the haptic feedback enhances users’ sensitivity to collisions in VR environments."

The bispectrum, derived from third-order statistics, effectively captures nonlinear phase coupling in RF signals and exhibits strong immunity to Gaussian noise. By integrating bispectral features with time-frequency waterfall representations, unique fingerprints are extracted that reflect hardware-specific impairments such as oscillator drift and power amplifier nonlinearity.

In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised occupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the supervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating pseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as multi-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model. Then the model is aligned with the occupancy map produced by LiDAR, fine-tuning its accuracy in occupancy estimation. Extensive comparative experiments validate the exceptional performance of 4D-ROLLS. Its robustness in degraded environments and effectiveness in cross-dataset training are qualitatively demonstrated. The model is also seamlessly transferred to downstream tasks BEV segmentation and point cloud occupancy prediction, highlighting its potential for broader applications. The lightweight network enables 4D-ROLLS model to achieve fast inference speeds at about 30 Hz on a 4060 GPU. The code of 4D-ROLLS will be made available at https://github.com/CLASS-Lab/4D-ROLLS."

Determining the optimal anchor configuration, i.e., sizes and aspect ratios of anchor boxes, remains a critical challenge, particularly when addressing defects with significant shape variations. While previous studies have predominantly focused on developing more efficient network architectures and learning strategies, the problem of anchor configuration determination has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, this paper proposes the IoU-Aware Clustering (IAC) algorithm, which autonomously learns suitable anchor configurations by extracting shape priors from diverse defects. IAC takes the training bounding boxes as potential clustering centers and selects a subset that aligns with the shape distribution of the training samples. The algorithm involves only a single hyper-parameter, the anchor number k, making it highly adaptable to various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that IAC can effectively generate anchor configurations tailored to defect shapes, significantly improving the mean Average Precision (mAP) by 6.9% and 14.4% on two industrial defect datasets with substantial shape variations."

The paper considers the key component of the specified algorithm, namely, the procedure for multiclass detection of defects in glass parts of high-voltage insulators. The procedure is based on a convolutional neural network capable of recognizing four types of defects: “chipped plate”, “closed bubble”, “insufficient compression”, “solid inclusions”. Synthetic data was obtained for training the neural network, the total number of training images was 25 thousand. The training of a neural network with the gradual addition of new classes of defects is shown. It is established that the addition of new classes of defects to the training data leads to a decrease in the accuracy of their identification in the case of significant visual differences between the new classes of defects and those previously added to the training sample. As a result, a neural network trained on the four classes of defects described is able to recognize the type of defect with a confidence of up to $86 \\%$ and calculate the geometric dimensions of defects with an error of no more than 0.12 mm, with the camera parameters used in our case. The results obtained for multiclass detection indicate the need for further improvement of the described procedure to ensure that the data obtained in it can be used as initial information at the stage of assessing the risk of defects from the point of view of impaired electrical strength."

    "abstract": "Robots with active variable stiffness (VS) capabilities can potentially achieve safer interactions with humans and better adaptabilities to uncertainties in complex environments. Currently, the conventional jamming or phase-change-based VS mechanisms simultaneously act on the stiffnesses of the robotic joint in all axes, making it difficult to achieve decoupled stiffness programming in different directions/axes. To overcome this challenge, a bio-inspired stiffness-programmable robotic flexible joint (SPRFJ) based on the electro-adhesive (EA) clutches is proposed. By programming the ON/OFF states of the EA clutches on different surfaces around the SPRFJ, customization of stiffness profiles in different directions/axes can be realized, and therefore, the load-bearing capacity and flexibility of the robotic arm can be adjusted. A SPRFJ prototype consisting of four EA clutch units is developed, and through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that it can achieve a stiffness change of 21 times and can withstand resisting forces up to 13.41 N at 1 kV.

    "abstract": "As autonomous personal mobility vehicles (APMVs) are increasingly integrated into shared spaces, short-distance interactions between pedestrians and APMVs will become more frequent. To facilitate communication in shared spaces, APMVs equipped with external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs). Although the eHMI is primarily designed to communicate with pedestrians, its communication also affects the APMV passenger due to the short-distance interaction. This paper focused on the effect of passengers’ personality traits on their user experience when the APMV exhibits different eHMIs. An experiment was conducted in the field with 24 participants as APMV passengers who experienced three distinct eHMI types: eHMI-T (text-based), eHMI-NV (neutral voice-based), and eHMI-AV (affective voice-based). Through causal discovery analysis, our findings revealed that when the APMV is equipped with eHMI-T, various personality traits of passengers collectively influenced their user experience. In contrast, the eHMI-NV design demonstrated that personality traits had no direct influence on user experience. The eHMI-AV design primarily showed that agreeableness and extraversion negatively influenced concerns about drawing attention, which subsequently affected other user experience. Based on the results, this paper recommends designing different eHMIs based on the APMV ownerships, such as private or public shared APMVs."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an active control strategy for lower limb exoskeletons by proposing an end-to-end framework employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable smooth transitions between different movement patterns. The majority of existing methods in exoskeleton literature employ finite state machines (FSM) that have proven successful in predicting the control strategy for the next state on the basis of sensor data such as IMU data, force, etc. However, one drawback of FSM occurs due to their inflexibility regarding sudden changes. Specifically, FSM is based on clear state transitions, which makes it hard to manage smooth continuous movements and increases the chance of sudden changes in control during transitions. These, in turn, raise safety concerns for the user. While learning-based control approaches have been suggested in recent years, the validation was performed in simulation environments. Therefore, the real-world applicability remains an open research question to date. To address this issue, we provide the first contribution in this field that proposes an end-to-end learning framework with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) module to enable smooth transitions between movement patterns under real-world conditions. By introducing several evaluation metrics, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of the adaptability and smoothness in movement transitions."

Recently, memory AMP (MAMP) has been proposed to address this issue, but it requires storing multiple redundant intermediate results, incurring substantial time and space overhead. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MAMP (LC-MAMP) for uplink M-MIMO detection by simplifying the mean and variance calculations in the linear estimator of MAMP. Simulation results show that compared to OAMP, LC-MAMP achieves a $98 \\%$ time complexity reduction while maintaining comparable error performance in $128 \\times 64$ MIMO system. Moreover, it further reduces time complexity by $10.5 \\%$ and space complexity by $22.3 \\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art MAMP-type detector without any performance loss. The corresponding hardware architecture is also provided."

    "abstract": "Forecasting multivariate time series has many real-world applications involving controlling the systems as well as dimensioning and planning their growth. The key difference from univariate time series is that the channel cross-correlations can be exploited to achieve forecasting with higher accuracy at the cost of possibly much larger complexity. On the other hand, simple techniques such as DLinear achieve very good performance, and they can be used also for multivariate time series by simply ignoring the spatial channe dependencies. Furthermore and importantly, the data pre-processing has a significant impact upon the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, a novel pre-processing strategy for multivariate time series is considered to extract the relevant spatio-temporal features for subsequent downstream processing including sample forecasting. Specifically, the time series are first spatially re-ordered into a longitudinal data matrix. The data matrix is then uniformly sliced into equal-size sub-matrices, which are referred to here as data symbols. The data symbols are further decomposed into the 2D regression trends and symbols of residual noises akin to empirical mode decomposition. The symbol size is chosen, so that the residual noise is approximately stationary. The concatenated features represent a transformed time series, which can be forecasted using channel-independent methods such as DLinear. Assuming EEG data and four forecasting accuracy metrics, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pre-procesing outperforms other channel-independent forecasting methods for multivariate time series across different forecasting horizons. In addition, the numerical results indicate that the forecasting accuracy is dependent on the frequency sub-band of EEG data considered."

This work focuses on charging dielectric and metal surfaces close to the electrical breakdown threshold in atmospheric air under humid and dry conditions. After initial charging to a maximum potential of roughly 30 kV, the associated surface charge is allowed to decay because of recombining with ions from the natural background, resulting in decay times ranging from minutes to hours to days. Spheres with a radius of 50 mm consisting of varying materials (PTFE and metal as referenced later) are charged and tested at relative humidity levels, RH, of 10%, 35%, and 64%. It was found that the ion-ion pair production rate and the enclosure size affected the measured charge decay rate. The impact of air convection on charge decay in the open air (no enclosure) is discussed. The humidity increased the rate of charge decay on the metal and dielectric spheres. For example, in the first 25 minutes after charging, the total charge on the PTFE sphere decreased to 66% or 50% from its initial value in the 10% and 35% RH tests, respectively. An equivalent generation rate is found for the ions in the enclosure, with 10 and 24 ion pairs cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup>s<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup> being generated at a 5% and 49% relative humidity, respectively."

Unlike conventional optimization or data-driven methods, our approach integrates expert domain knowledge, active inference, and semantic context-aware reasoning to enable real-time, interpretable decision-making. Specifically, we optimize power allocation based on UAV mobility to maximize system sum-rate while encoding semantic structures through unsupervised clustering and Bayesian inference.

It is designed to restore frequency even in the presence of compromised distributed generators (DGs). The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting and compensating the effect of various types of attack (e.g., scale, replay, and data integrity attacks) on DGs by utilizing two-hop communication information. The proposed method consists of two key stages: detection and compensation. In the detection stage, each DG's controller uses its own data, information from neighboring DGs, and three attack detection strategies to identify compromised DGs. Subsequently, in the compensation stage, each DG's controller determines the effect of attacks on the consensus control law and generates a compensation signal accordingly. In instances where attacks are not compensable, compromised DGs are isolated to ensure a consensus. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated over a modified IEEE 16-bus test system in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show that the proposed method is resilient to various types of attacks, including scaling attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks, and replay attacks."

    "abstract": "We show that the time-domain formulation of the dynamic losses in soft magnetic materials provided by the Statistical Theory of Losses (STL) leads to an accurate analytical prediction of energy loss and hysteresis loops in magnetic sheets and soft ferrites under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal induction. In its generalized form, this theory applies to both conducting and non-conducting materials by separately treating the dissipation phenomena engendered by eddy currents and spin damping. The equations for the classical and excess loss components and the predicted hysteresis loop dependence on the flux waveform are based on the definition and calculation of the instantaneous values of the classical and excess fields, where the material conductivity and the Landau-Lifshitz constant are the intrinsic parameters involved in damping. Energy loss measurements have been performed at different peak polarization values on Fe-Si (grain-oriented and non-oriented) and Fe-Co (Vacoflux) sheets up to 400 Hz and on Mn-Zn ferrites (N87) up to 500 kHz. The effect of distortion introduced by either a third or fifth harmonic component, 0° to 180° phase-shifted with respect to the fundamental component, is predicted, with and without minor loops, in the soft magnetic sheets. Instead, the Mn-Zn samples are tested under rectangular symmetric/asymmetric voltage, emulating the working regime of dc-dc buck converters. Whatever the case, the predictive method relies on the STL-based time-domain retrieval of the excess and classical viscous fields. This objective is achieved in ferrites through the theoretical prediction of the energy loss due to the spin-damping mechanism, while the skin effect in metallic sheets poses an effective upper-frequency limitation to the analytical approach."

The mixed-methods approach combining bibliometric mapping and thematic analysis identified five core domains: actor interaction, framework development, entrepreneurship, efficiency and effectiveness, and historical perspectives. The findings delineate the state of the art, while simultaneously exposing underlying divergences and conceptual lacunae. These gaps are articulated through a set of prospective research questions, systematically organised by model perspectives, actors, and salient characteristics. Findings confirm the predominance of the Triple Helix, while highlighting theoretical limitations that have motivated the development of higher-order models. Although the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices introduce societal and ecological dimensions, their operationalisation remains limited. On this basis, the study advances a structured synthesis designed not only to orient subsequent scholarly inquiry but also to enhance the practical deployment of innovation helix models in engineering and technology management."

This paper introduces an autonomous approach to one-to-many beacon synchronization using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adjust clock-sleep cycles for very imprecise-clock devices operating in energy-constrained IoT environments. The proposed method tackles key challenges such as clock drift and acute time fluctuations, which complicate synchronization and lead to unexpected desynchronizations. The novelty of this approach lies not in the method used to adjust sleep cycles but in its autonomous, device-specific adaptation, eliminating the need for manual calibration or model training. Through extensive experimentation with popular ESP32 devices, we evaluate the performance of the proposed RL-based solution against traditional beacon synchronization and supervised learning techniques, demonstrating improvements in synchronization adaptiveness and energy efficiency, achieving energy savings of up to 4.5 mJ per round. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge transfer mechanism that enables newly joined devices to rapidly adapt their synchronization parameters based on the experiences of previously trained devices. To encourage reproducibility, we provide open-source implementations of the proposed framework."

It extends the ability of the conventional analytical models. The database of the analytical model can store the electromagnetic information for the SPM motors, which enriches the scaling laws for electrical machines. As for the magnets with arbitrary shapes, they are divided into finite rectangles or fan-shaped segments based on their magnetization directions, which are then replaced by equivalent magnet currents along the magnet surfaces. Then, based on the iSAM, the air-gap field of the SPM motor can be obtained considering the iron nonlinearity. This method is beneficial for accelerating the optimization process aimed at reducing torque ripple in servo motor applications. The finite-element method (FEM) for eccentric magnetic pole servo motors is executed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, a prototype with parallel magnetized PM is tested to demonstrate the accuracy of the iSAM. The proposed method is particularly useful for the modeling techniques and fault diagnosis of electrical machines."

The structure comprises a double-layer energy-selective surface (ESS) with a stacked radiation layer. An equivalent circuit model (ECM) is developed to analyze the electromagnetic decoupling among functional layers.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate secure wireless transmission schemes assisted by double-irregular intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), where ‘irregular’ refers to non-uniform element distributions over expanded grid surfaces. The primary objective is to maximize the secrecy rate (SR) through joint optimization of the IRS element deployment, their corresponding phase shifts (for both discrete and continuous cases), and the transmit beamforming. Distinct from prior works, this study considers the reflective interaction between two irregular IRSs, a factor crucial for enhancing performance. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture by minimizing the transmit power while satisfying a target SR. A Lagrangian dual-based approach is adopted to derive a closed-form, optimal beamforming solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed double-irregular IRS scheme yields substantial performance gains over its conventional regular counterpart, evidenced by an average SR increase of <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">27%</b> and <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">42%</b> for the discrete and continuous phase-shift cases, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large naval vessels are not strictly rigid bodies. Inertial matching measurements are often used to continuously measure hull deformation, thereby achieving a unified spatial reference for the entire ship to ensure the combat effectiveness of onboard weapons. However, during combat, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is highly sensitive to impact vibration. This sensitivity induces attenuated interference signals, leading to significant steady-state errors or even divergence in inertial-based hull deformation measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to localize the position of the impact vibration, allowing for timely error correction in the inertial-based hull deformation measurement system. To address the challenge of impact vibration localization, this paper proposes a method for locating hull deformation impact vibration using inertial measurement information in conjunction with optical assistance on ships equipped with advanced optical sighting systems. Furthermore, to ensure rapid and precise localization of the impact vibration localization in wartime, the method combines inertial information with single-pixel imaging (SPI), utilizing high-speed light field modulation to achieve image-free and high-speed optical sighting point coordinate acquisition in the Fourier domain under ultra-low sampling rate conditions. By eliminating the need to reconstruct redundant information from complete images, this image-free optical assistance method effectively localizes inertial-based hull deformation impact vibration through the integration of inertial information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, with a sampling rate as low as 0.02 % of whole image-based methods within the response time of 600 ms, can effectively perform rapid impact vibration localization in inertial-based hull deformation measurements without requiring full images. Additionally, the method exhibits strong noise resistance and good applicability, offering new insights for the combined optical and inertial hull deformation measurement on large naval vessels."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of individual cells in tissue with the resolution of a single cell. However, “dropouts” will lead to an excess of zeros in the scRNA-seq data due to technical constraints, which could hinder further analysis. Consequently, imputing the dropout values becomes particularly critical in assisting with the recovery of biological information. Herein, we propose a dual-branch imputation method for scRNA seq data, which helps to impute the drops in scRNA-seq data. Unlike previous methods which assume a preconceived structure guiding to impute the dropouts, we believe that there are linear and non-linear associations that help structure the data, thus, both linear and non-linear pipelines are combined for dropout imputation. The evaluation and comprehensive downstream results on both simulated and real datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for recovery of gene expression, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, and pseudo-time trajectory analysis tasks.

Second, a locally implementable distributed observer with locally verifiable stability margins removes dependence on global spectral information and guarantees convergence under intermittent connectivity. Third, an average-based event-triggered controller with separate position and velocity gains reduces communication while preserving tracking accuracy and enforcing a strictly positive minimum interevent time compatible with hardware limits.

The approach incorporates spatial demand forecasting, photovoltaic (PV) system sizing, M/M/c queuing analysis, and agent-based modeling (ABM) to evaluate both wired and wireless EV charging strategies. Real demographic and mobility data from ten Riyadh Metro station zones are used to estimate daily EV arrival rates and charging demand, enabling location-specific infrastructure planning. Photovoltaic-powered wireless charging is introduced as a demand-shaping mechanism to relieve fast-charging congestion and reduce grid dependency. The model shows that serving 40 % of the daily EV load wirelessly can reduce charger requirements by up to 60%and lower average queue delays by more than 80 %. A PV system sizing analysis based on Riyadh’s solar insolation estimates annual energy yields up to 860 MWh per station and total carbon emission avoidance exceeding 1,000 tons <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CO</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> per year.

    "abstract": "Retinex theory, which treats an image as a composition of illuminance and reflectance, has made significant progress in low-light image enhancement. Previous methods attempt to refine the impractical Retinex theory by introducing deviations in estimated illumination and reflectance to develop more practical and robust enhancement techniques. However, the fact that state-of-the-art approaches still produce inferior results suggests that some form of corruption may be over-looked. In this paper, we propose a novel Complete Corruption-Aware Retinex Framework (CCRF), which not only considers corruption in low-light imaging—such as high ISO or long exposure settings—but, more importantly, also accounts for corruption induced by the enhancement method itself. Guided by this framework, we propose a Robust Corruption-Aware Loss (RCL) that enables the model to be robust under extreme darkness and complex light-object interactions. Additionally, we propose a Light-Up Map Denoising (LMD) module, which further eliminates model-induced perturbations. With these two plug-and-play modules, downstream tasks (e.g., low-light object detection) can benefit significantly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art approaches, resulting in significant performance improvements over these methods.

    "abstract": "Perception-based navigation systems are useful for unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation in complex terrains, where traditional depth-based navigation schemes are insufficient. However, these data-driven methods are highly dependent on their training data and can fail in surprising and dramatic ways with little warning. To ensure the safety of the vehicle and the surrounding environment, it is imperative that the navigation system is able to recognize the predictive uncertainty of the perception model and respond safely and effectively in the face of uncertainty. In an effort to enable safe navigation under perception uncertainty, we develop a probabilistic and reconstruction-based competency estimation (PaRCE) method to estimate the model’s level of familiarity with an input image as a whole and with specific regions in the image. We find that the overall competency score can accurately predict correctly classified, misclassified, and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We also confirm that the regional competency maps can accurately distinguish between familiar and unfamiliar regions across images. We then use this competency information to develop a planning and control scheme that enables effective navigation while maintaining a low probability of error. We find that the competency-aware scheme greatly reduces the number of collisions with unfamiliar obstacles, compared to a baseline controller with no competency awareness. Furthermore, the regional competency information is particularly valuable in enabling efficient navigation."

Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model, BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality. Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation. Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed ablation studies for the proposed methods.

We further define skill parameters with a differentiable mapping to end-effector motions, facilitating efficient trajectory optimisation. By modelling causal effects between task-relevant features extracted from point cloud observations and skill parameters, Celebi selectively adjusts update step sizes to enhance optimisation stability and convergence efficiency. Experiments in both simulated and real-world environments validate Celebi’s effectiveness, demonstrating robust and reliable performance in robotic excavation and levelling tasks."

This paper presents a multi-agent LLM system that generates network configurations. Our approach uses a sequence of LLM-based agents to decompose the original configuration task, expressed in natural language, into logical subtasks, which are then translated into configuration commands. The proposed LLM-based configuration generation process includes validation and suggests sanity tests to eliminate potential errors. We demonstrate our approach by generating Cisco IOS configuration files for multiple devices. We also propose a dataset of non-trivial reference configurations for evaluating generation accuracy."

    "abstract": "There is a growing demand for renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, including solar energy. Its intermittency and the restricted energy generation interval are obstacles to this source becoming the main source of energy for society. To mitigate these issues, a potential solution is its implementation combined with storage systems, which allow the management of the energy generated. However, this solution must be economically attractive to make the implementation viable. One way to make it viable is to store the energy generated during periods when the tariff is cheaper and use it during periods when the tariff is more expensive, generating savings on the energy bill. This paper presents a methodology for the economic evaluation of the implementation of energy storage systems in residential consumer units that opt for the white hourly tariff modality with the implementation of a photovoltaic generation system, verifying the sensitivity to the specific cost (R$/kWh) of the storage systems, and applying it to a case study. It is concluded that the implementation of storage systems for the studied scenario is not viable."

A constant effective refractive index and constant grating length unstrained CFBG was initially considered. The length of the grating was adjusted in order to realize effective squeezing of the optical vector, and to observe the effect on the Q-factors and the BER of the system, which ranged from 70 mm to 110 mm with 10 mm steps. The lengths of the fibers which were not equal to this value had lower Q-factors since the chromatic dispersion was under- and overcompensated. The outcome indicates that fine optimization of the CFBG length plays a major role in the enhancement of the system's performance and quality of the received signals. The improved model in this paper provides a cheap and easy method of dispersion compensation in relation to traditional dispersion-compensating fibers (DCF) for high-speed, long-haul WDM systems."

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure, little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners. It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1 score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an interaction partner’s self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in social robots with social cognition."

Existing approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes FABG (Facial Affective Behavior Generation), an end-to-end imitation learning system for human-robot interaction, designed to generate natural and fluid facial affective behaviors. In interaction, effectively obtaining high-quality demonstrations remains a challenge. In this work, we develop an immersive virtual reality (VR) demonstration system that allows operators to perceive stereoscopic environments. This system ensures that \"the operator’s visual perception matches the robot’s sensory input\" and \"the operator’s actions directly determine the robot’s behaviors\" - as if the operator replaces the robot in human interaction engagements. We propose a prediction-driven latency compensation strategy to reduce robotic reaction delays and enhance interaction fluency. FABG naturally acquires human interactive behaviors and subconscious motions driven by intuition, eliminating manual behavior scripting. We deploy FABG on a real-world 25 degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot, validating its effectiveness through four fundamental interaction tasks: affective interaction, dynamic tracking, foveated attention, and gesture recognition, supported by data collection and policy training."

    "abstract": "Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks. Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the robot’s grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates.

    "abstract": "Locomotion in robots remains an unsolved challenge, particularly for those with complex structures and dynamic environments. Consequently, the control systems for such robots must place greater emphasis on risk mitigation and safety considerations to ensure reliable and stable operation. Existing studies have explicitly incorporated risk factors into policy training, but lacked the ability to adaptively adjust the risk sensitivity for hazardous environments. This deficiency impacts the agent’s exploration during training and thus fails to select the optimal action. We innovatively introduce Adaptive Risk-aware Control (ARC) policies based on Distributional Reinforcement Learning (Dist.RL), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts risk sensitivity levels in response to changing environmental conditions. Our approach uniquely integrates two key components: (1) the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) for quantifying intrinsic environmental uncertainty, and (2) Random Network Distillation (RND) for evaluating parameter uncertainty. This dual-mechanism architecture represents a significant advancement in risk assessment methodologies. Simulations conducted on a variety of robots have demonstrated that our method achieves significantly more robust performance compared to other approaches. Furthermore, sim2real validation on a humanoid robot confirms the practical viability of our approach."

A fine-tuned deBERTa-v3 model, trained on the GoEmotions dataset and mapped to seven Ekman emotion categories is used for simplified emotion classification. The users' complete surveys before and after running and the system provides real-time emotion labels with confidence scores. These results are used to generate a dashboard of weekly emotion trends. On a validation split of the official GoEmotions dataset, the model achieved 69.73% accuracy and 61.79% F1 score. The paper also compares this model with baseline methods. The system employs a web-based interface and an API-driven backend to facilitate real-time evaluation of the emotion classification model."

Although recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication techniques in autonomous driving, a significant challenge persists: how to efficiently integrate multiple high-bandwidth features across an expanding network of connected agents such as vehicles and infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce CoMamba, a novel cooperative 3D detection framework designed to leverage state-space models for real-time onboard vehicle perception. Compared to prior state-of-the-art transformer-based models, CoMamba enjoys being a more scalable 3D model using bidirectional state space models, bypassing the quadratic complexity pain-point of attention mechanisms. Through extensive experimentation on V2X/V2V datasets, CoMamba achieves superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. The proposed framework not only enhances object detection accuracy but also significantly reduces processing time, making it a promising solution for next-generation cooperative perception systems in intelligent transportation networks."

We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.

This paper proposes HybridFusionAtt, a novel model for continuous joint angle estimation using surface electromyography (sEMG).

The model was validated using data collected from eight participants performing four activities of daily living (walking, stair climbing, stair descending, and obstacle crossing). The proposed model achieves average R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values for knee and hip joint angle prediction of 0.8682 (walking), 0.8482 (obstacle crossing), 0.9294 (stair climbing), and 0.8676 (stair descending). Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional LSTM and CNN-LSTM models in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in handling non-periodic actions such as obstacle crossing. The model achieves high performance by effectively fusing features and adaptively focusing on key features, enabling it to maintain robustness even under noisy conditions and significant individual differences. This demonstrates the model’s broad application potential, especially in rehabilitation and prosthetic control systems."

However, deploying robots in natural environments is challenging due to unpredictable factors such as plant variances and occlusions. This paper focuses on the localization of tomato trusses for autonomous harvesting by servoing a robot-mounted camera to different viewpoints. We build on previous work where the robot is provided with prior knowledge of the tomato plant. Specifically, the geometric relations between the trusses are modeled as ranges, which reflect uncertainty. Our main contribution is an approach that represents this uncertainty as polytope volumes. Polytopes enable scalable reasoning that facilitates likelihood estimation for viewpoint selection. Our method first constructs polytope hypotheses regarding the truss locations based on prior plant knowledge. It then refines the polytope shapes using Bayesian updates based on camera observations. Finally, the polytopes are used to select the next viewpoint that maximizes the chance of observing a new tomato truss. Experiments show that polytope-based viewpoint selection speeds up truss localization compared to earlier methods, advancing robotic harvesting."

However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter out unstable dynamic points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality."

However, PiH assembly in unknown environments is still challenging due to uncertainty in task parameters, such as the hole position and orientation, resulting from sensor noise. Although context-based meta reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been previously presented to adapt to unknown task parameters in PiH assembly tasks, the performance depends on a sample-inefficient procedure or human demonstrations. Thus, to enhance the applicability of meta RL in real-world PiH assembly tasks, we propose to train the agent to use information from the robot’s forward kinematics and an uncalibrated camera. Furthermore, we improve the applicability by efficiently adapting the meta-trained agent to use data from force/torque sensor. Finally, we propose an adaptation procedure for out-of-distribution tasks whose parameters are different from the training tasks. Experiments on simulated and real robots prove that our modifications enhance the sample efficiency during meta training, real-world adaptation performance, and generalization of the context-based meta RL agent in PiH assembly tasks compared to previous approaches."

This paper therefore presents a teleoperation system that utilizes a single RGB camera and advanced computer vision techniques to capture human motion, coupled with a kinematic mapping method to transfer movements from human to robotic arms. The system generates robot motion that ensures both end-effector tracking and human-like joint configuration imitation, adaptable to diverse structures, including those with multiple offset links. Experiments demonstrate that the system produces robot arm poses more closely aligned with human configurations compared to traditional methods that overlook human pose. The performance of the end-effector tracking control and human arm shape imitation is evaluated, with no noticeable error observed when the robot completes its motion and a maximum position error of 17.03% and a maximum orientation error of 0.0925 rad are observed during motion, which are likely attributed to delays cased by filters and communications. Additionally, the system’s ability to actively avoid obstacles via arm configuration imitation in specific scenarios is confirmed. Supplementary video is available."

    "abstract": "Tactile perception is crucial for robots to interact effectively with their environments, particularly in cluttered settings or when visual sensing is unavailable. However, a major limitation is the insufficient coverage of tactile sensors on current robots, which makes navigating cluttered spaces challenging due to the lack of capability to detect collisions. This limitation also hinders the use of teleoperation systems in such spaces by reducing the human operator’s situational awareness. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Touch-Linked Sleeve (TLS), a haptic mapping system that redirects contact on robot arms to human skin. The system consists of a tactile skin for contact detection and a haptic sleeve that enables human operators to experience telepresented contact. By establishing a transparent mapping between the robot’s tactile skin and the user’s haptic sleeve, operators can intuitively sense contacts from the robot’s perspective. To evaluate the system’s effectiveness, we conducted experiments demonstrating the functionality of both the tactile skin and the haptic sleeve. Moreover, we performed human studies using a virtual reality robot teleoperation interface to simulate navigation and manipulation in a cluttered scenario. The results indicate that the proposed system enhances perceptual transparency during object grasping tasks, leading to improved task completion times, fewer collisions, and improved overall usability."

Additionally, each agent behaves like a tractor, and a trailer is attached to the agent at each intermediate target location, which increases the \"body length\" of that agent by one unit. Planning for those tractor-trailers in a cluttered environment introduces additional challenges, since the planner has to plan each agent in a larger state space that includes the position of the attached trailers to avoid self-collision. Furthermore, agents are more likely to collide with each other due to the increasing body lengths, and the conventional collision resolution techniques turn out to be computationally inefficient. This paper develops a new planner called CBSS-TT that includes both novel inter-agent conflict resolution techniques, and a new single-agent planner TTCA* that finds optimal single-agent path while avoiding self-collision. Our test results show that CBSS-TT sometimes requires 60% fewer number of iterations while finding solutions with cheaper costs than the baselines."

Previous methods leveraged Laplacian distributions and cross-entropy for training but failed to effectively improve accuracy and even increased the network’s processing time. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Sampling-Gaussian as a substitute for soft-argmax. It improves accuracy without increasing inference time. We innovatively interpret the training process as minimizing the distance in vector space and propose a combined loss of L1 loss and cosine similarity loss. We leveraged the normalized discrete Gaussian distribution for supervision. Moreover, we identified two issues in previous methods and proposed extending the disparity range and employing bilinear interpolation as solutions. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our Sampling-Gaussian method. The experimental results prove that we have achieved better accuracy on five baseline methods across four datasets. Moreover, we have achieved significant improvements on small datasets and models with weaker generalization capabilities. Our method is easy to implement, and the code is available online."

    "abstract": "The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety, particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

    "abstract": "Collision-free robotic manipulation is extremely important for all safety-critical applications of robots. Especially for large-scale automation in modern manufacturing facilities where numerous hardware and software systems collaborate in relatively structured environments, accomplishing effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in not only repetitive tasks but also their sporadic reconfigurations is ideal. Yet, existing online and offline Motion Planning (MP) algorithms do not meet such a unique combination of harsh demands, since most of the advances in MP aim for a subset of the requirements. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel implicit neural function (EASEIR) designed for efficient offline safe set composition for robotic manipulators operating in structured environments. Addressing the challenges of managing high-dimensional configuration spaces (C-space), EASEIR leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to relate coordinates of a discretized robot operation space with collision sets in C-space. EASEIR then utilizes the mapping to actively compose a collision-free set in response to arbitrary occupancy of the operation space by obstacles. The proposed method comprises three core modules: (a) Latent Key Generator (LKG) that maps the coordinates of the space to intermediate latent keys, (b) Latent Key Decoder (LKD) that reconstructs collision sets from the keys, and (c) Full Set Compositor (FSC) that generates a full collision-free set using set operations. On a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) arm, EASEIR generates safe configuration sets nearly 43 times faster than the state-of-the-art analytical method while maintaining comparable accuracy (∼ 0.2% collision) during evaluations in a simulation environment."

    "abstract": "Continuum robots are widely used in the medical scenarios due to their dexterity and flexibility. However, precise end-to-end control of continuum robots remains challenging, limited by the kinematic or kinetostatic accuracy and no enough space for additional sensors configurations. This paper proposes a precise position control method for fiber-driven continuum robots using the reconstructed shape based on distributed force sensing from the same fibers, where the optical fibers serve as both robot actuation and force sensing simultaneously without requiring additional sensors. First, we use single-core optical fibers (SCFs) as the actuation cables of the continuum robot, and each fiber has multiple fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors inscribed on it to sense distributed force along the entire cables. Then, the forward kinetostatics model of the fiber-driven continuum robot is established using the known distributed forces as the inputs. Notably, the nonlinear friction between the cables and actuation channels does not require an additional estimation model. Benefiting from this, the shape can be accurately reconstructed after the stiffness calibration of the continuum robot. Finally, a position controller based on real-time feedback from shape is developed to achieve the tip position control of the continuum robot. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed forward kinetostatics model can achieve the shape reconstruction with the errors of 0.45 mm and 0.57 mm in planar bending and spatial bending states, respectively. By comparison to the traditional constant curvature kinematics-based control method, the proposed methods can achieve the mean absolute error of 0.37 and 0.6 mm in two distinct path tracking tests. The proposed method using distributed forces sensing enables a real-time accurate position feedback control combined with kinetostatic model, instead of modelling the nonlinear friction or adding additional external sensors."

    "abstract": "In this work, a multimodal point cloud registration method using CT and video frames is proposed to optimize the modeling of the bronchial cavity environment. Preoperative CT data improve the quality of point clouds acquired from intraoperative video frames. Initially, preoperative CT scans are used to obtain bronchial point clouds and airway centerlines, while intraoperative bronchial point clouds and endoscope trajectories are captured in real-time using SLAM. Given that intraoperative frame-by-frame mapping cannot be directly globally registered, multi-modal point clouds undergo local segmentation. Subsequently, the preoperative bronchial airway centerlines guide iterative scaling and adjustment of the preoperative CT point clouds, achieving precise registration between the CT and the video frame point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate a rapid and accurate enhancement in the quality of the intraoperative bronchial point cloud, providing more precise maps of the cavity environment for surgical robots. The method is validated and evaluated using CT and video frame data collected from ex vivo pig lungs, achieving intraoperative mapping accuracy of 0.5 millimeter, respectively. These results surpass those of methods relying solely on SLAM for intraoperative mapping."

However, current procedures mainly rely on manual expertise, which limits accessibility and scalability. Robotic automation presents a promising solution, but achieving precise real-time detection of multiple pipettes remains a challenge. Existing methods focus on ex vivo experiments or single pipette use, making them inadequate for in vivo multi-pipette scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a heatmap-augmented coarse-to-fine learning technique to facilitate multi-pipette real-time localisation for robot-assissted in vivo patch-clamp. More specifically, we introduce a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based module to remove background noise and enhance pipette visibility. We then introduce a two-stage Transformer model that starts with predicting the coarse heatmap of the pipette tips, followed by the fine-grained coordination regression module for precise tip localisation. To ensure robust training, we use the Hungarian algorithm for optimal matching between the predicted and actual locations of tips. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieved >98% accuracy within 10μm, and > 89% accuracy within 5μm for the localisation of multi-pipette tips. The average MSE is 2.52 μm."

This paper presents a methodology that integrates the Automotive Threat Matrix (ATM) with the ISO/SAE 21434 Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) process to systematically construct and analyze attack paths. Based on this analysis, we propose the Automotive Kill Chain Correlation (AKCC), a dynamic threat response framework that correlates security alerts along modeled attack paths for high-confidence detection.

Key results demonstrate OTFS’s superiority in high-mobility environments and NOMA’s spectral efficiency gains, though both face scalability hurdles.

In response, this paper presents TCNet, a Temporal Consistent Network for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. Specifically, we propose an Inter-frame Temporal Fusion (ITF) module to emphasize the influence of preceding images on the depth estimation of the current frame. The Temporal Consistency Loss (TCL) is proposed to leverage the temporal constraints between the depth maps of adjacent frames.

However, existing VO methods face challenges in visual degradation in extreme environments, e.g., high dynamic range or fast-motion conditions. Although event-based sensing schemes offer partial solutions to this problem, they are limited by unstable features and noise. Recently, a novel brain-inspired vision sensor, Tianmouc, has been reported, incorporating two complementary pathways: a cognition-oriented pathway (COP) for precise color intensity and an action-oriented pathway (AOP) for fast spatiotemporal sensing, considered a promising visual input for VO tasks. Here, we develop Complementary Pathway Spatial Enhanced Visual Odometry (CSVO) to cope with extreme scenarios by fusing the COP and AOP information of Tianmouc. To leverage the dynamic range expansion brought about by dual-pathway fusion, as well as the low-latency spatial difference data in AOP to address high-speed motion, we design an asynchronous dual-pathway feature encoder considering synchronous multimodal fusion and asynchronous cross-modal feature matching. To train and evaluate CSVO, we transform two conventional VO datasets, TartanAir and Apollo, to Tianmouc modality through simulation and collect a real- world Tianmouc-VO dataset in challenging scenes. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing methods on these datasets. Our work sheds light on the generalizability of agents working in extreme scenarios.

Conventional domain randomization methods typically exclude Static friction from their parameter space. In our robotic reinforcement learning task, such conventional domain randomization approaches resulted in significantly underperforming real-world models. To address this Sim2Real challenge, we employed Actuator Net as an alternative to conventional domain randomization. While this method enabled successful transfer to flat-ground locomotion, it failed on complex terrains like stairs. To further investigate physical parameters affecting Sim2Real in robotic joints, we developed a control-theoretic joint model and performed systematic parameter identification. Our analysis revealed unexpectedly high friction-torque ratios in our robotic joints. To mitigate its impact, we implemented Static friction-aware domain randomization for Sim2Real. Recognizing the increased training difficulty introduced by friction modeling, we proposed a simple and novel solution to reduce learning complexity. To validate this approach, we conducted comprehensive Sim2Sim and Sim2Real experiments comparing three methods: conventional domain randomization (without Static friction), Actuator Net, and our Static friction-aware domain randomization. All experiments utilized the Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) algorithm. Results demonstrated that our method achieved superior adaptive capabilities and overall performance."

SeparaTrek features separable and combinative ground and aerial locomotion parts by a free separation and combination structure, reducing the coupling relationship between ground and aerial functionality. Furthermore, we design a multimodal locomotion controller based on extended Kalman filter algorithm and adaptive sliding mode control, achieving stable locomotion of SeparaTrek on complex and variable terrain. Through experiments, it is demonstrated that SeparaTrek’s design is rational and its motion is stable."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training, which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step denoising.

Sensor free terrain awareness is incorporated using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to infer surface type purely from actuator positions over time. The RNN achieves an accuracy of 94% in terrain identification out of 8 possible options. We demonstrate that BeeTLe achieves a greater performance than the baselines across a series of challenges including: the traversal of a flat plane, a tilted plane, a sequence of tilted planes and geometry modelling a natural hilly terrain.

However, by nature of magnetic manipulation, these endoscopes are typically limited to a maximum of five degrees of freedom (DoF). With the need to introduce additional contact-based sensing modalities for subsurface investigation into these systems as well as to improve overall dexterity, it is both practically and clinically beneficial to recover the lost DoF i.e. the roll around the main axis. This paper presents a method of achieving the magnetic manipulation of an underactuated device by leveraging developable surfaces, specifically, the oloid shape. The design of a clinically relevant magnetic endoscope with all its ancillary elements, as well as contact sensors, is proposed and demonstrated in vivo. The contact sensor data from the in vivo experiments show that for sweeping motions over 100° of roll, contact between the endoscope’s sensor region and the colon wall can be maintained for 74% of the motion."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating complex real-world traffic, requiring safe handling of both common and critical scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies. However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula, focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics. This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability, reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher’s ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic, achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving."

We evaluate SoundAuth on a proprietary dataset of 14,028 keystroke samples from 8 users across 11 keyboards and the experimental results demonstrate near-perfect authentication accuracy (more than $98 \\%$ recognition rate, $0.1 \\%$ FAR), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on conventional keystroke dynamics.

    "abstract": "Reward design is a key component of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), yet some tasks and designer’s objectives may be unnatural to define as a scalar cost function. Among the various techniques, formal methods integrated with DRL have garnered considerable attention due to their expressiveness and flexibility in defining the reward and requirements for different states and actions of the agent. Nevertheless, the exploration of leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for guiding multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) reward design is still limited. The presence of complex interactions, heterogeneous goals, and critical safety requirements in multi-agent systems exacerbates this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel STL-guided multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. The STL requirements are designed to include both task specifications according to the objective of each agent and safety specifications. The robustness values from checking the states against STL specifications are leveraged to generate rewards. We validate our approach by conducting experiments across various testbeds. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to MARL without STL guidance, along with a remarkable increase in the overall safety rate of the multi-agent systems."

Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore, the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi-robot collaborative learning tasks show that the proposed CoCoL can significantly reduce both the number of communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Existing single RGB-based methods often compromise accuracy due to their reliance on initial pose estimates and susceptibility to rotational ambiguity, while approaches requiring depth sensors or multi-view setups incur significant deployment costs. To address these limitations, we introduce SplatPose, a novel framework that synergizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a dual-branch neural architecture to achieve high-precision pose estimation using only a single RGB image. Central to our approach is the Dual-Attention Ray Scoring Network (DARS-Net), which innovatively decouples positional and angular alignment through geometry-domain attention mechanisms, explicitly modeling directional dependencies to mitigate rotational ambiguity. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine optimization pipeline progressively refines pose estimates by aligning dense 2D features between query images and 3DGS-synthesized views, effectively correcting feature misalignment and depth errors from sparse ray sampling. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that SplatPose achieves state-of-the-art 6-DoF pose estimation accuracy in single RGB settings, rivaling approaches that depend on depth or multi-view images."

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot’s social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions."

Like the Jacob’s Ladder toy, Flip-Walker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner reminiscent of the toy’s cascading motion. Actuation is provided by motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the opposing segment, depending on the robot’s current configuration. A physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker’s flipping strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface, offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating irregular outdoor terrain."

    "abstract": "In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1) CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2) learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose SynthDrive, a scalable \"real2sim2real\" system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) Automated Rare-Case Mining and Synthesis. Given a text prompt describing specific objects, SynthDrive automatically mines image data from the Internet and then generates corresponding high-fidelity 3D assets, which eliminates the need for costly manual data collection. By integrating these assets into existing street-view data, our pipeline produces photorealistic rare-case data, supporting rapid scaling to diverse assets including irregular obstacles and temporary traffic facilities. 2) High-Fidelity 3D Generation. We propose a hybrid asset generation pipeline that combines a geometry-aware LRM, iterative mesh optimization, and an improved texture fusion algorithm. Our approach achieves 0.0164 Chamfer Distance on the GSO dataset, outperforming InstantMesh by 14.1% in geometry accuracy, and achieves 19.05 PSNR (vs 16.84) for texture quality. This enables fine geometry details and high-resolution texture generation, which is essential for perception model training. Experiments demonstrate that SynthDrive-generated data improves the performance of downstream perception tasks (2D and 3D detection on rare objects) by 2-4% mAP. SynthDrive greatly lowers the data production cost and improves the diversity for corner-case data generation, showcasing extensive potential applications in the field of autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Learning dexterous manipulation from few-shot demonstrations is a significant yet challenging problem for advanced, human-like robotic systems. Dense distilled feature fields have addressed this challenge by distilling rich semantic features from 2D visual foundation models into the 3D domain. However, their reliance on neural rendering models such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting results in high computational costs. In contrast, previous approaches based on sparse feature fields either suffer from inefficiencies due to multi-view dependencies and extensive training or lack sufficient grasp dexterity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Language-ENhanced Sparse Distilled Feature Field (LensDFF), which efficiently distills view-consistent 2D features onto 3D points using our novel language-enhanced feature fusion strategy, thereby enabling single-view few-shot generalization. Based on LensDFF, we further introduce a few-shot dexterous manipulation framework that integrates grasp primitives into the demonstrations to generate stable and highly dexterous grasps. Moreover, we present a real2sim grasp evaluation pipeline for efficient grasp assessment and hyperparameter tuning. Through extensive simulation experiments based on the real2sim pipeline and real-world experiments, our approach achieves competitive grasping performance, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.

We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Speech recognition in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) fully relies on audio-based Automatic Speech Recognition. However, speech recognition that relies solely on audio faces significant challenges in noisy environments and may lead to poor performance in such environments. One approach to address this is to also use lipreading in combination with traditional speech recognition. Recent work has shown that audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR) can achieve a Word Error Rate (WER) of only 0.9% on the dataset LRS3. In this paper, we assess the potential of combining audio with lipreading on a social robot platform, Pepper, which has not yet been widely tested for AVSR. Given that prior research has focused on non-robotic domains, it remains unclear whether such models can generalize well to social robot environments. We systematically evaluate and compare the performance of established offline and real-time audiovisual models with their audio-only counterparts. The experiments were conducted in both a controlled laboratory setting and a dynamic and noisy public environment. We evaluated the data using WER and also measured the inference latency of real-time models via Real-Time Factor and Words Per Second rates. The results demonstrate real-time performance for audio-only speech recognition across all latency metrics and near real-time performance for models that combine audio with lipreading. We also explored factors that might influence the inference performance of these models to understand how much video contributes to the audio. This includes factors related to (1) environmental and temporal variations, (2) model behavior, and (3) implementation choices. Our findings indicate that for now the audio-only models outperform the audiovisual models on a social robot platform, in contrast to what has been reported in the benchmarked literature. We conclude that more work is still needed to benefit from lipreading in HRI."

In this work, we design CapsDT, a Diffusion Transformer model for capsule robot manipulation in the stomach. By processing interleaved visual inputs, and textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world simulation manipulation."

Therefore, our method uses only internal sensors, such as a tiny inertia measurement unit (IMU), for robot posture acquisition and an encoder for distance measurement. Furthermore, a sensor-less joint torque control system was also implemented by using a specially designed printed circuit board with motor current regulation, allowing the robot to traverse the pipeline while suppressing excessive torque generation and slippage. The experiments to verify the performance of our route-drawing method were conducted on two types of pipelines with 3-in and 4-in inner diameters. It was revealed that the mean absolute error in the length of the straight sections was within 3% for all pipes, that in the rotational angle of the bent pipes was within 2 deg, and that in the direction of the straight pipes was within 2 deg."

While these type of growing robots enable frictionless movement within hollow structures, no existing soft robotic actuation mechanism can grow along the outer surface of an environment without generating friction. A robot with these capabilities could open new possibilities, such as endoscopic vein harvesting for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This paper introduces a novel growing robotic manipulator based on an outside-in material feeding mechanism - the inversion robot. Unlike conventional eversion robots, which expand by feeding material from the inside out, the inversion robot draws material from the outside to the inside, encapsulating its external environment within an inner sleeve to achieve frictionless movement. We present the design, implementation, and experimental validation of this inversion robot, investigating its growth behavior under varying pressure values and with different diameters, its ability to navigate along defined trajectories, and with a tools mounted to its tip. This inversion robot could enable vein dissection while preserving the surrounding fat layer, making it a promising innovation for minimally invasive vascular surgery and beyond."

The NN-Planner is trained on a dataset generated by an expert planner using batch sampling, capturing multimodal trajectory solutions. It learns to predict spatial and temporal parameters for trajectories directly from raw sensor observations. NEO-Planner starts optimization from these predictions, accelerating computation speed while maintaining explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a robust online replanning framework that accommodates planning latency for smooth trajectory tracking.Extensive simulations demonstrate that NEO-Planner reduces optimization iterations by 20%, leading to a 26% decrease in computation time compared with pure optimization-based methods. It maintains trajectory quality comparable to baseline approaches and generalizes well to unseen environments.

Traditional methods of asset and entity monitoring and tracking often face limitations such as delayed results, incomplete visibility over the entire range, and complications from manual data handling.

Simulation results validate the approach, demonstrating significant energy savings while maintaining high accuracy during space assembly tasks."

Read accuracy remains above 70% after 50 wash cycles for washable tags, while normal tags drop below 30%. RFID sorting saves up to 400 minutes per 1000 items, and highperforming systems achieve a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) of 94.6% versus 70.5% in low-performing setups.

    "abstract": "As a method for configuring firewalls, systems that combine Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) have attracted attention. However, in such systems, since the IDS is responsible only for attack detection and the blocking function is separated and handled by the SDN switch, there is a delay before malicious traffic is actually blocked. This delay consists of the time required for the IDS to detect the attack and to notify the SDN switch, allowing attacks to pass through during this period. This problem can be addressed by replacing the IDS with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), which integrates both attack detection and blocking. However, this change leads to a degradation in system performance due to the waiting time for traffic inspection by the IPS. In this research, we introduce two acceleration methods into the system to mitigate the performance degradation caused by replacing IDS with IPS: Benign Flow Bypass and DoS Blocking Offload. As a result of the evaluation, we confirmed the effectiveness of each proposed method. Furthermore, by combining the benign flow bypass and the DoS blocking offload, the system achieved 1.81 times higher performance under DoS attacks compared to the case without any acceleration methods."

Using both market-level (S&amp;P 500) and firm-level (Apple Inc.) data from 2016 to 2024, we assess forecasting performance under extended linear models and compare outcomes across different volatility sources. Our results show that including volatility and overnight trading effects significantly improves model prediction, especially when firm-specific volatility is used. Interaction terms between volatility and overnight returns occasionally achieve significance, suggesting nonlinear dynamics in return generation. While the linear models capture substantial predictive patterns at the monthly level, the use of machine learning methods does not consistently outperform them, likely due to limited sample size."

    "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of medical device usage is becoming increasingly important for effective maintenance and operation. However, conventional management methods often fail to record and visualize device operation status in real time, and it is difficult to monitor usage remotely without modifying the device itself. This study proposes a system for acquiring and visualizing the operational status of medical devices, without modifying the devices, by using the smart meter communication network—which is independent of Wi-Fi environments or internet connectivity—to support use cases such as home healthcare. The proposed system employs a device called Locamoni, which measures the electric current flowing through a medical device without modifying the device itself. The raw current data collected by Locamoni is transmitted to a gateway device, where it is encoded and compressed into simplified binary values representing only the operational state of the device. This data is then relayed via an ICE (Intelligent Communication Equipment) terminal to a Head-End System (HES) server. Finally, it is stored in a local MySQL-based database and visualized through a web application built using the Django framework. To evaluate the system, a three-day experiment was conducted using a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) device, which is a therapeutic device for sleep apnea syndrome. The operational data obtained by the system was compared with the actual usage logs recorded by the CPAP device. As a result, 91.5% of the metered values during actual usage periods were correctly identified as “operating,” with no false positives during non-usage periods. These results demonstrate that the proposed system can effectively and accurately detect the operational status of medical devices without physical modification, even in remote or home-based settings."

Therefore, this study aims to reduce the burden of equipment maintenance on SMEs due to aging equipment and labor shortages. The main objective is to promote the transition from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance, which streamlines equipment maintenance. To achieve this objective, we proposed a system consists of a time-series data extraction. In the demonstration experiment, data was collected from industrial machinery actually in operation at SMEs. Subsequently, the algorithm proposed in this study was evaluated. As a result, we confirmed that the time-series data extraction algorithm can accurately extract waveforms.

Compared to temporal action localization, the Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) task presents greater challenges, as its training data lacks detailed information about action boundaries. Existing WTAL methods ignore the complementary relationship between modalities and the dependency between snippets, resulting in inaccurate localization results. To solve these issues, we propose a Collaborative Hierarchical Aggregation Network (CHA-Net). Specifically, we first use a modality complementary module to learn the synergies between modalities. Then a collaborative enhance module is proposed to remove the information irrelevant to actions in RGB modality. Finally, a hierarchical aggregation module is proposed to capture the complete temporal information of action instances to better mine the temporal dependencies between snippets. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14, ActivityNet1.2 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with F3-Net (TMM2024, Avg{0.1:0.5}) and SPCC-Net (TMM2024, Avg{0.1:0.7}) on the THUMOS14 dataset, the proposed method can achieve improvements of 3.2% and 2.4%, respectively."

While recent studies have shown the capability of large language models (LLMs) to perform qualitative coding within theoretical frameworks, their potential for collaborative human-LLM discovery and generation of new insights beyond initial theory remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we proposed CHALET, a novel approach that harnesses the power of human-LLM partnership to advance theory-driven qualitative analysis by facilitating iterative coding, disagreement analysis, and conceptualization of qualitative data. We demonstrated CHALET’s utility by applying it to the qualitative analysis of conversations related to mental-illness stigma, using the attribution model as the theoretical framework. Results highlighted the unique contribution of human-LLM collaboration in uncovering latent themes of stigma across the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. We discuss the methodological implications of the human-LLM collaborative approach to theory-based qualitative analysis for the HCI community and beyond."

In China, Alipay and WeChat Pay handle billions of transactions annually to the extent that physical cards and cash are rarely carried or used. These platforms have been described as ‘walled gardens’ because financial transfers cannot be made directly between them. While Alipay and WeChat Pay share similar transactional components, they differ in their financial products, constraints, interdependencies, and social media integrations, and each offers different interactional possibilities for users to meet their everyday financial needs. We examine how users navigate infrastructural payment problems, perform financial management across different platforms and accounts, deal with ‘trouble’ in making payments, and weave their social and financial lives across platforms to create interoperability between these otherwise disconnected services. Our analysis suggests these apps do not just initiate, record and track payments, but are actively configured by users through interconnected social, transactional, and money-management practices, and that user interactions and digital payment practices are shaped by complex socio-financial arrangements. We discuss the findings, drawing implications for designing social-financial interactions in bridging disconnected services."

    "abstract": "Gradient sparsification (GS) is an effective method for reducing communication overhead in distributed training. For the first time, we introduce the concept of Multi-dimensional information into GS and propose a new gradient sparsification method named Multi-dimensional information-aware Gradient sparsification (MultiGS), which achieves high compression ratio with negligible accuracy loss and is applicable to mainstream network architectures. MultiGS reconstructs the layer-wise gradient by combining the high-frequency components of the local gradient and the low-frequency components of the sparsified global gradient that effectively addresses the issue of stale gradients and alleviates model bifurcation. Through the convergence proof of MultiGS for smooth non-convex problems and comparison with momentum SGD in convergence speed, we show that such new perspective approach is theoretically reasonable and practically effective. As validated with several mainstream model families (i.e., ResNets, VGGNet, LSTM, Vision Transformer, and Large Language Models), our MultiGS shows better accuracy over previous GS methods. Moreover, empirical results show that when a sufficient number of training nodes are available, MultiGS accelerates the distributed training by more than 3×, which is better than existing sparsification method."

    "abstract": "The omnidirectional mobile robots (OMR) are subjected to nonlinearity, actuator saturation, and external disturbances, making it challenging to achieve both high-precision tracking and strong disturbance rejection simultaneously. Meanwhile, finite-time and fixed-time control schemes have been widely applied in robotics due to their fast convergence and robustness. Therefore, the fixed-time tracking control problem for a class of uncertain OMR is investigated in this paper. Firstly, by introducing a fixed-time extended state observer (FxT-ESO), the total disturbance incorporating unknown dynamics and external disturbances are estimated to yield a physically interpretable design. Secondly, to address the impact of input saturation, an auxiliary dynamic system (ADS) is implemented. On the other hand, traditional disturbance rejection methods lack flexibility as they compensate for all observed disturbances indiscriminately. To address this issue, by means of energy analysis, a judgement function is developed to formulate a conditional disturbance negation-based strategy, and thus the OMR is endowed with the capability of taking advantage of exploitable disturbances rather than just rejecting them. By strict mathematical proof, it is validated that the fixed-time trajectory tracking control performance can be achieved under the proposed approaches. Finally, both simulation and experiment in various conditions illustrate the outperformance of the presented control scheme. Specifically, compared to the typical fixed-time control (FxTC) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), the proposed fixed-time conditional disturbance negation (FxTCDN) reduces the cumulative absolute error in the translational direction by approximately 27% and 52%, and the maximum absolute error by 20% and 43%, respectively. Furthermore, under two types of disturbances, compared to FxTC, FxTCDN can reduce the average energy by approximately 52% and 30%, respectively."

In order to speed up the motor design, a fast design process of high-speed induction motor with solid cage rotor is proposed. The mechanical strength of the rotor is guaranteed by analytical calculation method, and the mechanical strength of the rotor is verified by finite element model. Then, on this basis, with the goal of maximizing the motor efficiency and output power, the motor slot matching scheme and slot size were optimized. After optimization, the motor output power increased by 8.4%. Next, the temperature characteristics of each part of the motor were analyzed respectively through unidirectional magnetic-thermal method and magneto-thermal coupling. It was found that when using magneto-thermal coupling simulation, the various losses of the motor increased, and the average temperature of each part rose by 10%. Finally, the prototype is machined, and the dynamic balance experiment of the motor rotor is carried out to ensure the 120krpm high speed operation of the motor. The no-load test results proved the correctness of the mechanical design scheme of the motor rotor, and the three-dimensional finite element simulation simulated the output power of the motor."

    "abstract": "High-speed imaging, which captures the fleeting dynamics of moving objects at extreme frame rates, has become an indispensable tool across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Yet, the pursuit of high temporal resolution often comes at the cost of significant image degradation, due to the inherent limitations of imaging sensors and the extreme conditions of ultra-short exposure and massive data throughput. As a result, high-speed cameras often produce images marred by strong noise and severe color distortions. In this work, we propose a deep image signal processing (ISP) paradigm that enables high-speed cameras to maintain extremely high frame rates while achieving image quality comparable to that of digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. To this end, we make two key contributions: 1) constructing RHID, the first large-scale real-world high-speed imaging ISP dataset, comprising 282,912 RAW images captured by high-speed cameras and corresponding sRGB images captured by DSLRs, featuring complex degradations intrinsic to high-speed acquisition; and 2) proposing a misalignment-robust ISP learning framework (MisISP), equipped with a prior mapper-guided image alignment module (PMIA) and a spectrum-guided weakly-aligned image supervisory loss, which effectively addresses inherent pixel misalignments caused by heterogeneous sensor characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our paradigm substantially advances the performance of existing deep ISP models for high-speed imaging, achieving remarkable improvements in noise suppression, brightness enhancement, and color preservation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the ground Cartesian back-projection (GCBP) algorithm has demonstrated significant advantages for bistatic forward-looking synthetic aperture radar (BFSAR) imaging with arbitrary geometries and complex configurations, primarily due to its interpolation-free operation. However, airborne BFSAR systems must additionally address motion error compensation challenges. Implementing effective motion compensation (MoCo) within the GCBP framework for BFSAR presents two key challenges: 1) The forward-looking configuration induces severe image spectrum tilt and nonsystematic range cell migration (NsRCM), significantly degrading phase error estimation accuracy; and 2) Spectrum resampling during BP processing obstructs direct time domain phase error (TDPE) estimation from the image. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a phase error reverse recovery method based on ground combined beam coordinate (GCBC) for BFSAR. The proposed MoCo method establishes the GCBC system aligned with the echo signal’s azimuth Doppler variation, which eliminates image spectrum tilt and reduces NsRCM caused by the bistatic configuration. Within this system, we introduce the spectrum center correction and spectrum tilt correction, which effectively remove image spectrum aliasing and enable accurate image domain phase error (IDPE) estimation. Furthermore, an analytical reverse recovery relationship between IDPE and TDPE is derived. These stages significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of BFSAR motion error estimation. Simulation and real data results demonstrate the proposed method’s superior performance."

Readout of LC sensors is typically based on the use of commercial devices (impedance analyzers or vector network analyzers) that are not cost-effective solutions for use outside of the laboratory. Moreover, existing custom-made readout solutions usually rely on frequency/time sweep measurements that might require complex hardware. In this paper, we present an LC sensor readout method based on the single-frequency impedance measurement, with a unique solution for direct estimation of the LC sensor’s capacitance. Such an approach eliminates the need for measurements with a high number of data points and enables the estimation of the capacitance of the LC sensor at a frequency that is different than the resonant frequency. The proposed method is verified with the simulations as well as with the experimental results. Finally, the suitability for the deployment of the proposed data processing method on embedded hardware is also demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of individual cells in tissue with the resolution of a single cell. However, “dropouts” will lead to an excess of zeros in the scRNA-seq data due to technical constraints, which could hinder further analysis. Consequently, imputing the dropout values becomes particularly critical in assisting with the recovery of biological information. Herein, we propose a dual-branch imputation method for scRNA seq data, which helps to impute the drops in scRNA-seq data. Unlike previous methods which assume a preconceived structure guiding to impute the dropouts, we believe that there are linear and non-linear associations that help structure the data, thus, both linear and non-linear pipelines are combined for dropout imputation. The evaluation and comprehensive downstream results on both simulated and real datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for recovery of gene expression, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, and pseudo-time trajectory analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Indoor disaster relief and rescue missions require quadrotors to fully exploit their maneuverability in real-time. However, the computational complexity induced by the underactuated kinodynamics conflicts with the rapid replanning requirement. For agile trajectory planning in cluttered and unknown environments, we propose a real-time optimization-based quadrotor trajectory generation method that integrates kinodynamic constraints in both trajectory search and trajectory optimization phases to fully exploit maneuverability. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a waypoints selection strategy to reduce the computational burden of kinodynamic trajectory optimization by transforming obstacle avoidance constraints into waypoint constraints, thereby enabling safe trajectory optimization in real-time. Specifically, kinodynamic trajectories are searched under kinodynamic constraints, providing reliable initial values for subsequent numerical optimization. Nextly, a waypoints selection algorithm, based on an estimation of trajectory variation during optimization, is introduced to preserve the obstacle-avoidance properties obtained during the search phase by limiting the variation with waypoint constraints. Finally, trajectory is segmented by waypoints with fixed time intervals each segment and then optimized under kinodynamic constraints, ensuring real-time optimization at the cost of time allocation optimality. We evaluated our method through simulation and experimentally validate its performance in cluttered and unknown environments. The competence of proposed method is also validated in real-world experiments."

In this paper, we developed large language model (LLM)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL)-based adaptive S-surface controller for AUVs. Specifically, LLMs are introduced for the joint optimization of controller parameters and reward functions in RL training. Using multi-modal and structured explicit task feedback, LLMs enable joint adjustments, balance multiple objectives, and enhance task-oriented performance and adaptability. In the proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting task-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts into control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and unpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme sea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed controller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level tasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming traditional PID and SMC controllers.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>"

However, a key challenge remains: precise and flexible camera pose control, which is crucial for accurate viewpoint transformation and realistic simulation of scene dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PosePilot, a lightweight yet powerful framework that significantly enhances camera pose controllability in generative world models. Drawing inspiration from self-supervised depth estimation, PosePilot leverages structure-from-motion principles to establish a tight coupling between camera pose and video generation. Specifically, we incorporate self-supervised depth and pose readouts, allowing the model to infer depth and relative camera motion directly from video sequences. These outputs drive pose-aware frame warping, guided by a photometric warping loss that enforces geometric consistency across synthesized frames. To further refine camera pose estimation, we introduce a reverse warping step and a pose regression loss, improving viewpoint precision and adaptability. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving and general-domain video datasets demonstrate that PosePilot significantly enhances structural understanding and motion reasoning in both diffusion-based and auto-regressive world models. By steering camera pose with self-supervised depth, PosePilot sets a new benchmark for pose controllability, enabling physically consistent, reliable viewpoint synthesis in generative world models."

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2’s inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

While sparse representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with—and ultimately surpass—dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline detection. Specifically, SparseMeXt-Tiny reaches a mean average precision (mAP) of 55.5% at 32 frames per second (fps), while SparseMeXt-Base attains 65.2% mAP. Scaling the backbone and decoder further, SparseMeXt-Large achieves an mAP of 68.9% at over 20 fps, establishing a new benchmark for sparse representations in HD map construction. These results underscore the untapped potential of sparse methods, challenging the conventional reliance on dense representations and redefining efficiency-performance trade-offs in the field."

To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD) maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning.

However, limited research has explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with SAR to facilitate emotion co-regulation between parents and children with neurodevelopmental disorders. To address this gap, we developed an LLM-powered social robot by deploying a speech communication module on the MiRo-E robotic platform. This supervised autonomous system integrates LLM prompts and robotic behaviors to deliver tailored interventions for both parents and neurodivergent children. Pilot tests were conducted with two parent-child dyads, followed by a qualitative analysis. The findings reveal MiRo-E’s positive impacts on interaction dynamics and its potential to facilitate emotion regulation, along with identified design and technical challenges.

However, existing methods primarily rely on the visual token’s feature similarity for token merging, overlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve as a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the visual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose ToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial awareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as input to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial information for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial awareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves critical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA outperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual and embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT, making it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

    "abstract": "To achieve en bloc resection of bladder tumor and the anterior tumor resection in transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), a cystoscope transurethral continuum robotic system has been proposed. A continuum cystoscope in the system needs to bend more than 180° and its base has translation, axial rotation, and tilt degrees of freedom to achieve full bladder accessibility. Under the constant-curvature assumption, the analytical solution of inverse kinematics already exists for multi-segment continuum robots with variable segment lengths and continuum robots with two inextensible segments. However, there is a lack of analytical inverse kinematics solution for continuum robots with features of the continuum cystoscope. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel and efficient inverse kinematics solving algorithm for the continuum cystoscope used in TURBT. The proposed method simplifies the inverse kinematics problem by constructing a robot plane coordinate and uses geometric relationships to derive a non-linear constraint equation containing only one intermediate variable. By solving this non-linear equation, the solution to the entire inverse kinematics problem is obtained. Additionally, based on this inverse kinematics algorithm, the length of the continuum segment is designed to ensure full bladder accessibility. In the comparative experiments with the Jacobian-based method, which involves 12500 target poses, the proposed method solves 100% of the inverse kinematics problems with a much greater computational efficiency."

This paper models the pathwise inverse kinematics of redundant mechanisms as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem. We propose an efficient gradient-free optimization method named MoeIK, which demonstrates strong multi-objective balance, rapid global convergence, and adaptability. Our approach enhances the method by integrating relaxation dominance, adaptive interval search strategies, and a restart strategy, significantly improving performance in overcoming many-objective optimization challenges.

To address this shortcoming, we develop a more structured state grounding framework that features a domain-conditioned scene graph as its scene representation. We show that such representation is actionable in nature as it is directly mappable to a symbolic state in planning languages such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We provide an instantiation of our state grounding framework where the domain-conditioned scene graph generation is implemented with a lightweight vision-language approach that classifies domain-specific predicates on top of domain-relevant object detections.

The model’s application illustrates its effectiveness in reducing total energy costs, resulting in an optimized daily operational expenditure of ${\\$}$929.48. The results highlight the model’s effectiveness in promoting resilience, demonstrated by its ability to manage critical loads via strategic battery dispatch (e.g., up to 695 kW) during simulated grid outages. The MEM model offers a solid framework for improving operational resilience and economic performance in microgrids."

    "abstract": "Food waste management plays a vital role in maintaining a sustainable ecosystem, however, the presence of inorganic contaminants within food waste significantly hinders this potential. Robotic automation offers a promising solution to accelerate waste sorting, yet the diverse and unpredictable nature of contaminants poses major challenges to robotic perception and grasping. This benchmark study explores the feasibility and limitations of conventional robotic grasping systems, replicating real-world industrial conditions to highlight the complexities of food waste sorting. A comprehensive automated robotic grasping pipeline is introduced, integrating advanced 6D grasping pose detection, collision-free robotic arm motion planning, and effective grasping with three top-performing robotic end-effectors. Extensive experimental evaluations (up to 1500 robotic grasps) compare the performance of different gripper designs and the corresponding grasping strategies under three high-fidelity environmental scenes, providing valuable insights into the limitations of the current robotic system. Experiment results demonstrate the significant strengths of each gripper when dealing with objects of varying types or in different environments. This is critical for enhancing robotic sorting capabilities, particularly in advancing multimodal gripper technology."

By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical challenges: feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes. Specifically, in rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses. Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

This paper presents VRobotix, a virtual reality (VR)-based framework that enables cost-effective and scalable robotic dataset generation through immersive human-in-the-loop control within a physics-accurate robot simulation. By leveraging off-the-shelf VR headsets (e.g., Oculus Quest 3), VRobotix eliminates the need for physical robots while supporting a URDF-compatible, physics-based simulator that accommodates adaptable robotic platforms and egocentric control interfaces, including handheld controllers and body posture tracking. Benefiting from the physics-based simulation, a unique contribution of VRobotix is the replay module, which can regenerate synchronized multi-modal dataset (kinematic states, RGB-D streams) with multiple dataset formats based on the replayable trajectory, supporting various robotic applications. Additionally, an imitation learning module is developed to train control policies using the data collected by VRobotix. Experiments on three initial tasks—pushing, grasping, and stacking—demonstrate a high data collection success rate, averaging 92.0%. Furthermore, policies trained on just 50 trials achieve a 100% task success rate.

    "abstract": "The performance of a vision simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system based on hand-crafted features degrades significantly in harsh environments due to unstable feature tracking. With the breakthrough of convolutional neural networks in deep feature extraction tasks, many researchers have tried to incorporate them into SLAM systems. However, it’s challenging to guarantee the real-time performance of the entire SLAM system, and the erroneous usage scenarios limit the superior performance of deep feature extraction methods. To overcome these problems, we propose a visual-inertial SLAM system with multi-level detector and descriptor, called VINS-MLD2. In our framework, we first design an efficient deep feature extraction network that has the same performance as R2D2 by concatenating multi-level features, but runs 3 times faster under the image resolution commonly used in SLAM. Then, based on the camera baseline, we introduce the Matching Fusion, a matching method that fuses deep descriptor matching and optical flow matching results to improve matching accuracy for both short and wide baselines. In addition, an adaptive matching strategy is proposed to balance the running time and accuracy by adaptively adjusting the matching method. Experimental results in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) deployments and real-world environments demonstrate that the proposed method tracks features more stably and accurately.

This paper proposes a methodology to perform such validation using high-resolution data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). By leveraging PMU measurements, the line current can be monitored and the AC resistance of the transmission line can be estimated. After filtering out transient events that may bias resistance calculations, and by incorporating certain environmental variables-while reasonably assuming others-it becomes feasible to apply the IEEE Std 738-2023 to estimate the actual conductor temperature dynamically. This estimated temperature can then be directly compared against the assigned DLR values for specific time intervals, enabling real-time compliance verification."

Traditionally, this process relies on human demonstrations captured through pose estimation or motion capture systems. In this paper, we explore a text-driven approach to obtain imitation motion data more flexibly and simply. To address the inherent discrepancies between the generated motion representations and the kinematic constraints of humanoid robots, we propose an angle signal network based on norm-position and rotation loss (NPR Loss). It generates joint angles, which serve as inputs to a reinforcement learning based whole-body motion control policy. The policy ensures tracking of the generated motions while maintaining the robot’s stability during execution. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, successfully transferring text-driven human motion to a real humanoid robot NAO."

To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for collision-free loco-manipulation in real-world applications. The framework comprises two key modules: (1) a Loco-manipulation Motion Prior, which generates loco-manipulation skill trajectories via Trajectory Optimization (TO), and (2) a Collision-free Manipulation module using a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)-based trajectory generator and a vector-based trajectory follower. Extensive experiments have been conducted in both simulation and real-world scenarios to evaluate our framework’s tracking accuracy, whole-body coordination, and workspace expansion capabilities.

While absolute blood flow was not sufficient for detecting discomfort, variance in blood flow changes showed a potential correlation. Based on this, a detection method was proposed using the temporal variance of blood flow change, and optimal thresholds were evaluated. In addition, $\\operatorname{tcpCO}_{2}$ was analyzed as a stable physiological index reflecting later stages of discomfort. Detection rules were designed for each index, and their performance was assessed independently and in combination.

Studies on human-machine teams demonstrate that human perceptions of a machine teammate are critical in governing the machine’s performance. Consequently, it is essential to identify the factors that contribute to positive human perceptions in human-machine teams. Here, we present a mixed factorial design to assess human perceptions of a MEDEVAC robot in a simulated evacuation scenario. Participants were assigned to the role of casualty (CAS) or bystander (BYS) and subjected to three within-subjects conditions based on the MEDEVAC robot’s operating mode: autonomous-slow (AS), autonomous-fast (AF), and teleoperation (TO). During each trial, a MEDEVAC robot navigated an 11-meter path, acquiring a casualty and transporting them to an ambulance exchange point while avoiding an idle bystander. Following each trial, subjects completed a questionnaire measuring their emotional states, perceived safety, and social compatibility with the robot. Results indicate a consistent main effect of operating mode on reported emotional states and perceived safety. Pairwise analyses suggest that the employment of the AF operating mode negatively impacted perceptions along these dimensions. There were no persistent differences between CAS and BYS responses."

    "abstract": "Differential-driven wheeled robots (DWR) represent the quintessential type of mobile robots and find extensive applications across the robotic field. Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint velocity constraints, which can result in degraded control performance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications."

Geometric feature descriptor methods neglect object-level spatial topology features, resulting in inadequate performance in loop closure detection. Semantic graph-based loop closing methods improve upon this, however, they still follow the paradigm of \"first generating descriptors, then comparing similarity, and finally achieving alignment (6D pose)\". Specifically, they compare two semantic graphs that are not spatially aligned, which makes direct node correspondences impossible and necessitates extensive descriptor extraction and comparison. This decouples similarity comparison from 6D pose estimation, resulting in a cumbersome process that limits practicality and scalability. This paper proposes SLOOP, a novel descriptor-free semantic graph matching method that \"aligns two graphs first, followed by efficient similarity comparison\". Specifically, we first design a dedicated neighborhood semantic feature module to extract high-quality matched node pairs. Next, we seek the aligned coordinate systems for candidate loops based on the robust ground normal vectors and two suitable node pairs examined by the two-stage global geometric consistency metrics. Finally, the aligned coordinate systems enable efficient extraction and comparison of node spatial distributions. We conducted extensive outdoor loop detection experiments and compared with various loop closure detection approaches, demonstrating the improved performance of SLOOP in loop closure detection and its practicality.

    "abstract": "Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics, particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data. However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion patterns, limiting the model’s ability to understand complex motion patterns. To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process, enhancing the model’s understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

People believe powerful data-driven methods can learn efficient and general navigation policies from a vast offline dataset. However, robot navigation tasks differ from common planning tasks and present unique challenges. It often involves multi-objective optimization to meet arbitrary and ever-changing human preferences. It should also overcome the short-sighted problem to obtain globally optimal performance. Furthermore, high planning frequency is needed to address real-time demands. These factors obstruct the application of data-driven methods in robot navigation. To address these challenges, we integrate one of the most powerful data-driven methods, the diffusion model, into robot navigation.

Its Transformer network backbone outputs action sequences to alleviate short-sightedness. It also includes special distillation skills to boost the planning speed and quality.

The results obtained were promising, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in identifying the disease and its ability to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves. In comparison with previous studies, the model demonstrated superior performance, underscoring the potential of customized architectures for addressing agricultural challenges. This work contributes to the field of precision agriculture by offering an automated solution for detecting leaf diseases, with practical implications for reducing losses in rice crops. The subsequent trajectory of this field will entail the implementation of field tests and the integration of the technology with embedded devices, with the objective of facilitating real-time applications."

    "abstract": "The reliability of precision motion systems, such as semiconductor wafer scanners, is often influenced by nonlinear dynamics originating from components such as cable slabs. This paper introduces a data-driven framework for early fault diagnosis in these systems. Koopman operator theory is employed to derive a linear state-space model from experimental data, capturing the complex, hysteretic behavior of the cable slab. This model serves as a digital twin, and by comparing its predictions with real-time sensor measurements, operational anomalies can be detected. A systematic process for selecting observable functions yields a high-fidelity model with a tracking error of approximately ±1% across the operational range. When the proposed approach is tested against a state-of-the-art neural network model, it demonstrates a 75.4% reduction in reaction force prediction error. The framework successfully identifies an injected sensor noise fault (SNR of 20) in just 0.35 s using only force data, validating its potential to improve wafer scanner reliability."

Conventional methods based on mechanical contact, optical forces, or confined microfluidics constrain dynamic reconfiguration and surgical accessibility. Here, we introduce a dual-bubble acoustic micromanipulator that enables multidirectional rotation through controlled hydrodynamic fields. By placing oscillating microbubbles at the tips of micropipettes, this system creates adjustable vortex patterns: a single microbubble generates toroidal flows for out-of-plane rotation, while two microbubbles produce shear forces for in-plane spinning. This approach uses simple mechanical adjustments to control rotational axes in open fluid environments, without needing frequency modulation or phase synchronization. Flow-field simulations and experiments with polystyrene microspheres confirm deterministic orientation control, and tests with shrimp embryos demonstrate rotation at clinically relevant speeds. The open architecture integrates seamlessly with standard microscopy and robotic injection systems, offering a non-contact, precise tool for applications such as polar body alignment, intracellular surgery, and 3-D imaging."

In application, an ATES keeps large quantities of thermal energy in groundwatersaturated aquifers. Normally, an ATES system comprises two (one for heat and one for cold) storages and supports the heating and cooling efforts of simultaneously present HVAC system components. This way, the operation and emissions of installed and, usually, fossil fuel-based components are reduced. The control of ATES systems is challenging, and various control schemes, including model predictive control (MPC), have been proposed. In this context, we present a lightweight input-output-data-based autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) model of the hybrid ATES system dynamics. The ARX model allows the design of an output-based MPC scheme, resulting in an easy-to-solve quadratic program and avoiding challenging state estimations of ground temperatures.

Traditional measurement methods, including contact-based techniques (e.g., coordinate measuring machines and ball-bar systems) and non-contact systems (e.g., laser trackers and optical coordinate measuring machines), offer high precision but are often costly, complex to install, and constrained by environmental factors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a SLAM-based performance evaluation method that leverages LiDAR to track robotic motion without requiring external calibration references. This approach provides a cost-effective and flexible alternative to conventional metrology techniques. However, integrating SLAM into the ISO 9283 framework presents challenges related to accuracy, stability, and measurement consistency. To assess its feasibility, this study evaluates the SLAM-based system by analyzing key performance parameters, ensuring its alignment with industrial requirements. The results demonstrate that the LiDAR-based SLAM system achieves an RMSE of 0.0353 mm in trajectory estimation, confirming its precision and stability. These findings validate the system’s capability as a reliable benchmarking tool for robotic arm performance assessment."

The literature has reported numerical solutions employing Laplace's equation to find the potentials of these fields by imposing floating boundary conditions at the edges of the domain of interest. This type of boundary does not determine the solution to Laplace's equation as occurs in Dirichlet and Neumann problems; rather, it aims to limit the space used for the numerical simulation. Usually, the criterion employed to select the floating boundary is that the potential does not change beyond that margin by assigning it a local minimum or extreme value. However, in the vicinity of the boundary in stations with power distribution lines inside, the fields typically decay in a dipolar manner, and the extreme value approximation is not correct. In this work, we present a method for estimating the floating boundary by analyzing the variation of the potential, evaluate its performance in the two-dimensional case, and show its generalization to the three-dimensional case."

    "abstract": "Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%."

    "abstract": "For trajectory generation of whole-body jumping motions such as humanoid backflips, it is crucial to simultaneously optimize the takeoff, flight, and landing phases while considering full-body dynamics and kinematics. Although such methods have been proposed for standard jumping motions, they have not been applied to more dynamic actions such as frontflips, backflips, and yaw twist jumps, where strong nonlinearity and high sensitivity to certain parameters (e.g., rotor inertia and torque cost weights) pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we apply a two-stage optimization strategy to an existing full-body dynamics optimization method that simultaneously optimizes the takeoff, flight, and landing phases. In our approach, the same initialization and reference trajectory generation rules are shared across motions, and the solution from the first optimization is used not only as an initial guess but also as a reference in the second optimization. This strategy improves the convergence of the KKT residuals across various jump types and mitigates sensitivity to parameters such as rotor inertia and torque cost weights. As a result, our method achieves unified trajectory generation for frontflips, backflips, yaw twist jumps, and standard jumps using the same initialization, cost weights, and constraints. We also analyze the sensitivity to rotor inertia and show that exceeding a certain threshold can lead to a sharp deterioration in KKT residual convergence."

Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model’s historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round’s aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round’s exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models’ possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA’s superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersectionover-Union (mIoU)."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving is a high-performance, safety-critical task. Effectively controlling autonomous vehicles to enhance both performance and safety is crucial, especially in complex and dynamic environments. However, in real-time obstacle avoidance (OA) scenarios, the planning layer often fails due to high computational complexity and response delays. This trade-off between computational efficiency and safety performance presents a key challenge: how to achieve an optimal balance between autonomous driving safety and real-time performance. In recent years, addressing OA at the control layer has become a major research focus for improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. Given the advantages of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in prediction and constraint handling, this paper integrates an OA safety distance constraint into MPC to effectively handle OA in Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). First, a Taylor expansion is used to construct the UGV’s error model. Then, safe distance constraints for obstacle avoidance are formulated, considering both tracking errors and proximity to obstacles. Additionally, a Safe Obstacle Avoidance MPC (SOAMPC) is developed by integrating safety distance constraints and physical limitations. Furthermore, key control-theoretic properties are established, including recursive feasibility, guaranteed collision avoidance, and system stability. Simulations and experiments in a multi-obstacle environment validate SOAMPC’s effectiveness. Results show that SOAMPC not only ensures obstacle avoidance and stability but also outperforms other methods in efficiency and path tracking accuracy."

In order to optimize communication, HyperGraph ROS dynamically selects the optimal communication mechanism while maintaining a consistent API. For intra-process messages, Intel-TBB Flow Graph is used with C++ pointer passing, which ensures zero memory copying and instant delivery. Meanwhile, inter-process and cross-device communication seamlessly switch to ZeroMQ. When a node receives a message from any source, it is immediately activated and scheduled for parallel execution by Intel-TBB. The computational hypergraph consists of nodes represented by TBB flow graph nodes and edges formed by TBB pointer-based connections for intra-process communication, as well as ZeroMQ links for inter-process and cross-device communication. This structure enables seamless distributed parallelism. Additionally, HyperGraph ROS provides ROS-like utilities such as a parameter server, a coordinate transformation tree, and visualization tools.

Existing approaches have enabled navigation within these tight constraints, but struggle in dynamic and cluttered scenes.To this end, we present Focus Bug, a novel and robust mapless navigation algorithm that can run on extremely limited hardware. Focus Bug reduces the amount of processed sensory data using a tiny reinforcement learning policy, only processing the inputs necessary for navigation. We use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to identify critical parts of the robot’s range data and combine it with classical mapless navigation methods to benefit from their robustness and established performance. We implement and evaluate Focus Bug both on a drone in simulation and a micro-rover in the real world to show it can be applied across embodiments. Our hybrid approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in DRL navigation (57% less collisions in dynamic environments) while reducing the amount of range data processed by 87%, and achieving a 2.6X improvement in processing time compared to classical methods. Focus bug is the first method to achieve the high success rate of robust methods (97%) within such a tight compute budget."

To address these limitations for automated characterization of cellular mechanical properties, this study proposes a novel method using microchannels with narrow geometric structures to measure cellular mechanical characteristics. A dynamic mechanical characterization technique with serially connected microchannels simulates malignant tumor cell deformation and migration in vivo, enabling precise identification of three malignant tumor cell lines and three normal cell lines through consecutive compressions. High-speed imaging combined with computer vision and image processing techniques facilitates rapid and accurate automated analysis for tumor cells. Furthermore, this study reveals that the mechanical properties of the cell nucleus determine the overall cellular mechanics, with the differences between tumor and normal cells attributed to variations in nucleus mechanics. This approach shows promise for early cancer diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based navigation methods have demonstrated promising results for mobile robots, but suffer from limited action flexibility in confined spaces. Conventional DRL approaches predominantly learn forward-motion policies, causing robots to become trapped in complex environments where backward maneuvers are necessary for recovery. This paper presents MAER-Nav (Mirror-Augmented Experience Replay for Robot Navigation), a novel framework that enables bidirectional motion learning without requiring explicit failure-driven hindsight experience replay or reward function modifications. Our approach integrates a mirror-augmented experience replay mechanism with curriculum learning to generate synthetic backward navigation experiences from successful trajectories. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that MAER-Nav significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining strong forward navigation capabilities. The framework effectively bridges the gap between the comprehensive action space utilization of traditional planning methods and the environmental adaptability of learning-based approaches, enabling robust navigation in scenarios where conventional DRL methods consistently fail."

    "abstract": "Autonomous valet parking (AVP) aims to help the human drivers navigate to the desired location in the parking lot. Currently, the AVP task is not flexible enough to perform the open-vocabulary navigation tasks such as \"navigate to the exit\" or \"park near the elevator\". The widely used map formats for AVP like vectorized maps have some limitations including limited semantics, high cost and poor human-machine interaction, restricting the flexible application of AVP in complex scenarios. To address these problems, we propose AVP Scene Graph (AVP-SG), a hierarchical visual language mapping and navigation framework for open-vocabulary AVP tasks, which enables autonomous navigation from multi-modal human instructions. Our framework consists of two parts: a bottom-up mapping module and a top-down navigation module. In the mapping pipeline, assisted by the vision-language model (VLM) and optical character recognition (OCR) model, we first extract open-vocabulary conceptual semantics from images and project them to the elements of map. Next, by the bottom-up scheme performing feature fusion layer by layer, the scene graph is built hierarchically, consisting of slot, lane, block, and garage layer. In the top-down navigation pipeline, the navigation goal can be efficiently found by an LLM-enhanced graph retrieval approach. Experiments on real-world AVP tasks prove that the self-driving vehicle can perform open-vocabulary AVP tasks successfully utilizing the AVP-SG."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the robust finite-time stabilization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with disturbance rejection, where the finite-time can be predetermined. The AUV is modeled as a rigid body moving within fluids, and the systems dynamics involves uncertain parameters arising from the hydrodynamic coupling between the AUV and fluid, along with unknown external disturbances. Direct compensation for the system’s dynamics, a common approach in controller design, is ineffective for AUVs with uncertainties. Therefore, a robust anti-disturbance control method without compensating for unknown dynamics is proposed. To begin, a time rescaling method is introduced to convert the specified finite-time stabilization of the system into an asymptotic stabilization for a time rescaling system. Then, an exponential PID controller is designed for the time rescaling system to handle unknown constant disturbances while a high-gain control strategy is used to suppress the uncertain dynamics, which also enhances the robustness against the uncertain dynamics. The specified finite-time stabilization control law is ultimately derived from the designed exponential control law of the time rescaling system. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the results."

However, these approaches are built on a tremendous number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids, leading to high memory and storage costs and slow training speed. To address this limitation, we propose a compact 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that reduces the number and the parameter size of Gaussian ellipsoids. A sliding window-based masking strategy is first proposed to reduce the redundant ellipsoids. Then, a novel geometry codebook-based quantization method is proposed to further compress 3D Gaussian geometric attributes. Robust and accurate pose estimation is achieved by a local-to-global bundle adjustment method with reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster training, rendering speed, and low memory usage while maintaining the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality of the scene representation."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the \"goal-driven\" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets."

    "abstract": "Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots. Diffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental aspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have successfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their competence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal future trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have limitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions rather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics. However, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream objectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness (goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly optimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training scheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn non-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness. Specifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to shape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and outperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art performance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various baselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective motion planning."

Inspired by studies indicating the critical role of language in cognition and reasoning, we propose a new approach to bridge robot perception and socially aware actions through human-like language reasoning. We introduce Social robot Navigation via Explainable Interactions (SNEI), a human-annotated vision-language dataset comprising over 40K Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs across 2K unique social scenarios, drawn from diverse, unstructured public spaces. SNEI contains perception, prediction, chain-of-thought reasoning, action, and explanation, thereby allowing robots to interpret social contexts in human language. We fine-tune a Vision-Language Model, Social-LLaVA, on SNEI to demonstrate the potential of language-guided reasoning for high-level navigation tasks. Experimental evaluations—both quantitative and qualitative—demonstrate that Social-LLaVA can outperform state-of-the-art models.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">†</sup>."

In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware distributional offline RL method to simultaneously address both epistemic uncertainty and environmental stochasticity. We propose a model-free offline RL algorithm capable of learning risk-averse policies and characterizing the entire distribution of discounted cumulative rewards, as opposed to merely maximizing the expected value of accumulated discounted returns. Our method is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments in both risk-sensitive and risk-neutral benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance."

The memory usage required by standard solutions grows linearly with the number of semantic classes being considered, which can pose a bottleneck in large and many-class scenes. This paper proposes two novel methods for compressing the memory used by semantic fusion: calibrated top-k histogram and encoded fusion. The first method maintains, for each voxel, only the counts of the k most likely classes, while the second method uses a neural network to encode all-class probability vectors into a k-dimensional latent space in which per-voxel fusion is performed. The fused result is then decoded, at query time, using another neural network. Experiments show that both methods preserve map accuracy and calibration even at low values of k, and per-voxel memory usage is linear in k. The proposed methods can achieve real-time semantic fusion with 150 classes on commodity GPUs in building-scale scenes where prior approaches run out of memory."

Conversely, in low dynamicity states, spatiotemporal consistency of appearance cues aids in recovering object states. To address this issue, we propose a straightforward, effective, and versatile Dynamicity Adaptation for Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation, named DA-Track. First, we leverage the sensitivity of appearance cues to dynamicity through pre-association, capturing dynamic behavior in objects. Second, Dynamicity Adaptation incorporates Dynamicity Selection to identify reliable appearance cues based on pre-association results and Occlusion Dynamicity Fusing to adaptively integrate appearance and motion cues by analyzing historical mask variations.

The embedded density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder. Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general 2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected. Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset, demonstrating its generalizability.

    "abstract": "New technologies can produce changes in concepts, such as how the concept of work changed with online interfaces, money changed with new currency technologies, and cancer changed with the introduction of microscope technology. Research on animal-computer interactions (ACI) has changed concepts like user, welfare, evaluation, and participatory design, as the design of technology with animals as users, participants, and beneficiaries has required new concepts. We propose that ACI research has the potential to transform an even more fundamental concept: what an “animal” is. We hypothesize that ACI researchers have often been operating with essentialist concepts of animal categories such as species, breeds, or even categories like dog, bird, ape, and wild animal, where those grouping have aimed to reflect “biological” or “natural” groups that are fixed and unchanging. Drawing from the social philosophers Sally Haslanger’s and Ian Hacking’s methods of analyzing socially constructed categories, we propose that the essentialist concept of animal categories could inhibit ACI research and produce technologies that reinforce the existence of such categories. In turn, research on animal-technology interactions, if conducted with a social constructionist conception, could disrupt conceptions of animal categories, revealing ways in which animal categories are produced by animals’ material and social conditions, including their technological realities, and could change with changing technologies, opening new doors for ACI research and beyond."

    "abstract": "As demand for good primary healthcare grows, it becomes more important to understand what nursing students look for in a job. This study explores what influences their job choices at different levels of education. We used a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to collect data from 391 nursing students. They were asked to choose between job options that varied by six features: salary, staffing numbers, work environment, work pressure, team atmosphere, and commute time. To study the results, we used a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model. This helped us find patterns and see which job features matter most. We found that salary is the top priority for students. But other factors like team atmosphere, work environment, and pressure also play important roles. One key finding is that a high salary becomes even more appealing when the work atmosphere is friendly. These two factors together make a job much more attractive. By combining machine learning with DCE, we were able to better understand how students’ preferences differ. This approach can help shape smarter hiring and support plans in community nursing."

Nevertheless, existing works have limitations in terms of accuracy and generalization. In this study, we developed an AI-optimized biostatistical model (AIOBM) for accurate prediction risk of RA. The model is a classic Cox proportional hazard model and logistic regression architecture, supplemented by deep learning architecture with a multilayer transformation module, as well as a GNN to model the potential biological correlation of feature network among patients and attention mechanism to select key factors. At the optimization level, we formulated a new learning problem and developed a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the joint accuracy and interpretability of a model, encode biostatistical priors as regularization terms into the learning objective so as to drive the model to learn decision paths consistent with medical principles. The whole model is comprised of four modules: feature embedding module (dealing with the multi-modal medical data), cross-representation module (leveraging the Transformer to discover the interaction patterns), GNN inference module, and risk prediction module, constituting a hybrid system with high interpretability and stable predictions. experimental results demonstrate that AIOBM outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for real clinical RA data."

    "abstract": "As urban labor markets become increasingly complex due to the digital transformation of economic systems, traditional workforce governance tools are proving insufficient. This research presents a neural network-based strategy for improving socio-labor control in megacities by moving from raw, unstructured data to smart, flexible decision-making. The study combines advanced Big Data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) with more than 12 million data points from statistics agencies, digital platforms, and urban social media. Empirical tests conducted across four major Russian cities with 2,570 survey respondents demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances labor management outcomes: forecast accuracy for labor demand improved by 30%, crisis risks were reduced by an average of 23.45%, and operational load on employment services decreased by up to 30% under advanced digital maturity scenarios. These results are especially critical against the backdrop of Russia's historically low unemployment rate of 2.9% in early 2024, a stark contrast to the global youth unemployment rate of 13% and the anticipated 23% job churn globally over the next five years. The study contributes to the emerging field of AI-driven urban governance and demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM, CNN, and RNN neural architectures in resolving labor market complexities in digitally transforming megacities."

In the context of increasingly fierce competition in the e-commerce industry, where numerous platforms are vying for user attention and market share, personalized recommendation has emerged as a key means to enhance user experience and improve enterprise benefits. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the principles underlying collaborative filtering, content-based, and deep learning algorithms, exploring their unique mechanisms and applicable scenarios. Combined with the actual operation data of a certain e-commerce platform, which has accumulated massive user behavior records and product information over years of operation, it is found that the hybrid recommendation algorithm formed by integrating these algorithms has achieved remarkable results: the click-through rate of the homepage increased from 3.2% to 5.4%, the search conversion rate rose from 6.8% to 9.1%, and the shopping cart associated purchase rate increased by 35%. In view of the common problems of data sparseness, cold start and privacy leakage in the application process, which have long plagued the effectiveness and sustainability of recommendation systems, this paper proposes solutions such as matrix factorization, multi-algorithm fusion and federated learning, so as to provide practical references for e-commerce platforms to optimize recommendation systems and improve marketing efficiency."

    "abstract": "In the context of the accelerated empowerment of education by artificial intelligence, AIQ (Artificial Intelligence Quotient) has gradually become an important indicator for measuring the comprehensive abilities of university students. However, there is still a lack of systematic empirical research on the relationship between AIQ dimensions and the learning effectiveness of IPE (Ideological and Political Education) courses in universities. To fill this gap, this article constructs an MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) model based on AIQ assessment and IPE courses learning effectiveness data of university students from a certain university, explores the predictive ability of AIQ on IPE courses learning effectiveness, and combines LIME (Local Interpretable Model Deductive Explanations) method to conduct local interpretability analysis on the model results. The research results show that the MLP model has high accuracy and stability in predicting the learning effectiveness level of university students' IPE courses. The LIME analysis results further reveal that among the four dimensions of AIQ, “Communication Ability” and “Learning Ability” have a significant predictive contribution to the learning effectiveness of IPE courses, with SHAP average values of 0.07724 and 0.066679, respectively. The research results indicate that dimensions play a key role in improving students' learning effectiveness in IPE courses."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a covert communication system based on a hybrid active and passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (HAPRIS), where each RIS element can be dynamically configured to operate in either active or passive mode. By dynamically configuring the operational mode of each element, the system can effectively harness the high-gain benefits of the active RIS while simultaneously preserving the low power consumption and enhanced covertness properties offered by the passive RIS. Then, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem by jointly optimizing the active/passive mode selection vector, transmit beamforming vector and reflect coefficient matrix subject to the power, covertness and hardware constraints. To evaluate the detection performance of the warden, we further derive a tractable expression of the covertness constraint for the multi-antenna warden. To solve the mixed-integer non-convex problem, we propose a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) scheme utilizing the block coordinate descent method to decompose the original problem into several sub-problems, which are subsequently solved via the Lagrangian multiplier method and the interior-point method. In addition, we investigate a comparative scenario considering the position error of warden. Specifically, we first derive an expression for the estimation error of channel state information (CSI) based on the position error. We then propose a successive convex approximation method to obtain an upper bound on the CSI error, enabling us to formulate a worst-case covertness constraint. Finally, we extend the proposed PDD scheme to such a scenario with the CSI error. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes."

A case study from the literature was used to highlight limitations in traditional methods and shows that the standard uncertainty of the temperature estimate remains around 0.85 °C under certain conditions. Experimental tests were performed on two other motor models under industrial conditions to validate the proposed method for various configurations."

    "abstract": "Data-driven soft sensor techniques are increasingly being applied in complex industrial environments, enabling the modeling of many previously intractable variables and playing a critical role in ensuring stable industrial operations. However, solely data-driven soft sensor models suffer a certain degree of performance degradation when encountering scenarios with distribution drift. This stems from their exclusive reliance on correlation information for modeling. To enhance the models’ stability in strongly time-varying scenarios, causal information is introduced into the model to enhance its robustness. However, existing causal-enhanced soft sensor models often overlook collaborative causal effects during causal mining and lack dynamic integration of causal information stability and data dynamics. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Causal Synergistic Graph (CausalSynG) network, which developed a multivariate collaborative causal structure inference framework to derive causal topology and incorporated an expert prior correction mechanism based on the contribution of data to endow causal information with data dynamics. Additionally, to fully leverage causal inference results, a causal-enhanced graph structure mechanism based on correlation information is proposed to integrate correlation and causal information. Based on this, a Fused Causal Temporal Graph (F-CausalTG) network is proposed to correctly fuse temporal and causal information to achieve the goal of target variable modeling. Experimental results from petrochemical processes and blast furnaces validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed soft sensor model. In the debutanizer scenario, the proposed method achieved a 17.95% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to the optimal baseline method, with a 19.44% improvement in the coefficient of determination (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>). In the Blast Furnace Ironmaking Process (BFIP) coke ratio scenario, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) decreased by 7.58%, providing more intuitive evidence of the method’s performance improvement and ensuring the credibility of the conclusions."

This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant design that addresses static eccentricity (SE) through: (1) a harmonic-based SE detection index derived from induced voltage spectra, and (2) an optimized rotor geometry with injected harmonics for passive SE compensation. Unlike existing solutions that rely on signal processing or winding modifications, the proposed method embeds fault tolerance directly into the rotor design. Finite-element analysis demonstrates a 35.5% reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) and 30.7% lower position error under SE conditions. Experimental results from a prototype show improved accuracy in both healthy and faulty operation. This paper establishes a new concept for resolver design by integrating mechanical fault detection and compensation during the normal operation of a single robust system."

    "abstract": "Hot rolling production scheduling (HRPS) is an essential process in modern steel manufacturing. Its effectiveness is influenced by three primary challenges: selecting suitable slabs to maximize efficiency and maintain product quality, adhering to increasingly stringent carbon tax regulations, and managing uncertainties in processing times stemming from fluctuations in rolling speed. This article presents a novel robust HRPS problem under carbon tax regulation (RHRPSP-CTR) that considers slab selection, carbon tax regulation, and uncertain processing times simultaneously for the first time. Based on a budgeted uncertainty set, we develop a robust counterpart model that utilizes a classical dualization scheme and dynamic programming recursive equations to address the challenges associated with evaluating the worst case cost of carbon emissions (CEs) and determining the worst case completion time for each slab caused by processing time uncertainty, respectively. Recognizing the characteristics of slab selection and the high computational complexity in the large-scale RHRPSP-CTR, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm incorporating two enhancement strategies: a slab selection rule and a max–min weight update mechanism. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields optimal solutions for small-scale problem instances and high-quality, robust solutions for large-scale instances within a relatively short computation time. Moreover, the results indicate that compared with deterministic HRPS schemes, robust HRPS schemes lead to only a slight increase in cost. Notably, a higher carbon tax does not necessarily lead to lower CEs, and a larger uncertainty budget coefficient or uncertainty range does not always result in higher CEs."

Dentro dessa cadeia produtiva, o lingotamento contínuo se destaca como uma etapa crítica, especialmente devido aos desafios associados a defeitos dimensionais e superficiais nas placas de aço. Essas falhas comprometem a qualidade do produto, reduzem o rendimento metálico e resultam em perdas financeiras significativas. Este trabalho apresenta o desenvolvimento de um sistema de inspeção dimensional para placas de aço imediatamente após o lingotamento contínuo, com foco na medição da largura por meio de técnicas de visão computacional. O objetivo do sistema é verificar se as placas atendem à largura mínima exigida pelo processo e se a diferença entre as larguras das duas extremidades está dentro dos limites tolerados, possibilitando a detecção de formatos trapezoidais indesejados. Para isso, foi instalada estrategicamente uma câmera de espectro visível para capturar imagens da superfície superior das placas, permitindo a segmentação dos quadros e o processamento em tempo real. A metodologia envolveu aquisição sistemática de imagens em ambiente industrial, aplicação de algoritmos de segmentação utilizando o modelo YOLO v11 e validação das medições com base em dados fornecidos pela usina siderúrgica parceira. Os testes demonstraram que o sistema atingiu uma precisão média de medição de 5,9 mm quando comparado às medições manuais realizadas pela equipe operacional da planta."

    "abstract": "With the advent of the intelligent era, increasing attention has been given to facial aesthetics. While the academic community has achieved notable progress in facial aesthetic research, current efforts predominantly concentrate on two isolated subtasks: aesthetic evaluation and enhancement. Crucially, the intrinsic correlation between these tasks and their integration within a unified framework remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a facial aesthetic enhancement and prediction network based on differential average aesthetic perceptions (Diff-AEPNet) that synergistically combines facial aesthetic enhancement with prediction. The proposed framework implements a four-stage architecture: (1) a transformer module learns latent code beautification trajectories to guide preenhancement feature modification; (2) a dual-stream encoder extracts and contrasts pre/postbeautification features to refine evaluation accuracy; (3) a lightweight network generates attention-guided image mask for image fusion; and (4) a deghosting block eliminates fusion artifacts through residual learning. The experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves a favorable beautification effect in the enhancement task and exhibits better generalization performance across datasets in the evaluation task than existing aesthetic evaluation models do."

    "abstract": "High-resolution range profile (HRRP) has emerged as a promising approach in real-time radar ground target recognition. To address the real-world operational requirements, it is demanding to develop open set recognition (OSR) that identifies both known and unknown classes of targets. In this paper, we propose a neural collapse-guided hierarchical prototypical learning (NHPL) method for HRRP OSR. The key of prototypical learning is constructing class-specific prototypes in the feature space as the representatives. However, this is challenging in HRRP recognition due to the intrinsic aspect-sensitivity, which results in variation of feature distribution and deviation of estimated prototypes. To tackle the above issues, we employ a hierarchical classification strategy which decomposes the OSR task into a multiple level recognition framework according to the hierarchical semantic taxonomy of classes. Within each level, discriminate features can be more effectively learned, thereby constraining the variation. Furthermore, inspired by neural collapse theory, we estimate class prototypes using the weight vectors of the trained network's final layer. This approach aligns prototypes closely with features of known classes while staying distant from features of unknown classes, thereby reducing prototype deviation. Extensive experiments on measured HRRPs demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness for recognizing unknown classes."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet have demonstrated remarkable transferability for developing effective full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models. However, existing approaches typically demand pixel-level alignment between reference and distorted images—a requirement that poses significant challenges in practical scenarios involving natural photography and texture similarity evaluation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel FR-IQA model leveraging deep statistical similarity derived from pre-trained features without relying on spatial co-location of these features or requiring fine-tuning with mean opinion scores. Specifically, we employ distance correlation, a potent yet relatively underexplored statistical measure, to quantify similarity between reference and distorted images within a deep feature space. The distance correlation is computed via the ratio of the distance covariance to the product of their respective distance standard deviations, for which we derive a closed-form solution using the inner product of deep double-centered distance matrices. Extensive experimental evaluations across diverse IQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our model for optimizing texture synthesis and neural style transfer tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative measures and qualitative assessments. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/h4nwei/DeepDC."

    "abstract": "Rating prediction is a classic task in recommendation systems, aiming to accurately estimate user ratings for various items. Historical ratings typically exhibit a non-uniform distribution, leading recommendation models to favor predicting high-frequency ratings. We refer to the inconsistency between predicted ratings and users' true preferences caused by non-uniform rating distributions as <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rating bias</i>. To mitigate this bias, existing studies capture various interaction behavior patterns and employ knowledge distillation techniques to improve the network's ability to model user preferences. However, due to the model being trained on datasets with non-uniform rating distributions, the rating bias may propagate through the knowledge distillation process across different behaviors, thereby contaminating the modeling of users' true preferences. To this end, we propose a novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Adversarial Counterfactual Distillation</i> (ACD) framework for the rating prediction task, aimed at eliminating rating bias.

In the presence of noisy range measurements, the accuracy of the target robot’s pose estimation is highly dependent on the chosen formation geometry. Different from existing works, we account for the heterogeneous standard deviations of range measurements across different UWB transmitter-receiver pairs. We establish new optimality conditions for formation geometries and conduct a sensitivity analysis of optimal formations under robot positioning errors. In a 2D setting, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for both optimality and robustness to robot positioning uncertainty. Experimental results confirm the heterogeneous standard deviations of UWB range measurements and validate the target robot’s confidence ellipse model. An experimental comparison of formation geometries, optimized with and without considering heterogeneous noise, emphasizes the importance of accounting for the heterogeneous standard deviations of range measurements. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that robust formation geometries improve the target robot’s confidence ellipse in the presence of positioning errors."

    "abstract": "Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module, inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers. Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action module."

    "abstract": "Aerial robots have demonstrated significant potential in suspended cargo transportation, especially in industries such as logistics and food delivery. Due to the underactuated and nonlinear dynamics of the cable-suspended system, directly tracking a given trajectory with a multicopter without modifying its controller often leads to significant payload swing. This compromises the safety and stability of the cargo. To address the aforementioned issue, this paper proposes an online trajectory refinement method for a variable-length cable-suspended aerial transportation robot, independent from the control layer. By incorporating payload swing angle information, the reference trajectory is refined in real-time, effectively suppressing payload oscillations during transportation. Specially, Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle’s invariance theorem are employed to rigorously guarantee the feasibility of the designed trajectory refinement scheme. Finally, hardware experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the refined trajectory not only enables precise positioning of the multicopter, but also effectively suppresses payload oscillations during transportation, significantly enhancing the safety and reliability of the aerial cargo delivery."

To address this challenge, we propose MT-Fusion, a novel deep learning workflow based on multi-task learning (MTL) that targets multiple specific degradation scenarios. MT-Fusion incorporates specific encoder modules for processing various degraded images, a degradation attention mechanism for fusion, and a shared decoder for image reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed specific scenario-guided image fusion strategy has obvious advantages in robot perception in the image fusion performance and degradation treatment. For the inference stage, we propose a selector that could automatically categorize the degradation of input and activate the specific encoder.

    "abstract": "Fixed-Lag smoothing is widely employed as a backend in localization tasks. Generally, increasing the window length leads to better accuracy, but demands more computational resources. Therefore, determining an appropriate window length and whether a fixed length should be maintained throughout the localization process are worth studying. Assuming independent and identically distributed noise based on the distance-independent characteristic of LiDAR ranging errors, we propose an uncertainty-based adaptive sliding window (ASW) strategy. Through mathematical derivation, the reference uncertainty is affected by the LiDAR feature distribution of each frame. Consequently, we develop a multimodal LiDAR inertial odometry and mapping framework based on ASW, which integrates mechanical and solid-state LiDAR to enhance odometry accuracy and mapping density. By designing a joint matching module, our approach leverages the strengths of distinct scanning patterns. Additionally, we incorporate loop closure detection in the mapping process to minimize cumulative drift. Extensive experiments conducted on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our approach improves the average accuracy by 10.3%.

Current temporal action localization methods typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency. Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization (ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc."

    "abstract": "This work presents a comparative analysis of feature selection methods for fault classification in rotary machines using vibration data from Fiber Bragg Grating accelerometers. Features from the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains were selected using filter-based (Minimal Redundance Maximal Relevance, Laplacian Score), wrapper-based (Genetic Algorithm), and embedded (Random Forest, Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) approaches. The selected features were evaluated using supervised classifiers (Multilayer Perceptron, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and the unsupervised K-means algorithm. Genetic Algorithm and Random Forest methods achieved the best performance, reducing the number of features by a factor of eight while maintaining accuracies near 98% for supervised models. Feature selection also improved the K-means pipeline, leading to a significant increase in accuracy. Comparing the MLP and KAN models, KAN achieved performance comparable to that of the MLP while requiring fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, KAN enables classification through explicit symbolic functions that can be readily deployed in embedded applications. This study contributes by systematically comparing feature selection techniques applied to data from Fiber Bragg Grating sensors in the context of motor fault diagnosis."

    "abstract": "We introduce ET-Former, a novel end-to-end algorithm for semantic scene completion using a single monocular camera. Our approach generates a semantic occupancy map from single RGB observation while simultaneously providing uncertainty estimates for semantic predictions. By designing a triplane-based deformable attention mechanism, our approach improves geometric understanding of the scene than other SOTA approaches and reduces noise in semantic predictions. Additionally, through the use of a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE), we estimate the uncertainties of these predictions. The generated semantic and uncertainty maps will help formulate navigation strategies that facilitate safe and permissible decision making in the future. Evaluated on the Semantic-KITTI dataset, ET-Former achieves the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) and mean IoU (mIoU) scores while maintaining the lowest GPU memory usage, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. It improves the SOTA scores of IoU from 44.71 to 51.49 and mIoU from 15.04 to 16.30 on SeamnticKITTI test, with a notably low training memory consumption of 10.9 GB, achieving at least a 25% reduction compared to previous methods.

However, there are several settings, such as construction or warehouse automation, where a robot needs to interact with a structured object formation such as a stack. In this context, we define the problem of selecting suitable objects for grasping along with estimating an accurate 6DoF pose of these objects. To address this problem, we propose a camera-IMU based approach that prioritizes unobstructed objects on the higher layers of stacks and introduce a dataset for benchmarking and evaluation, along with a suitable evaluation metric that combines object selection with pose accuracy. Experimental results show that although our method can perform quite well, this is a challenging problem if a completely error-free solution is needed. Finally, we show results from the deployment of our method for a brick-picking application in a construction scenario."

    "abstract": "Cable-driven serpentine manipulators hold great potential in unstructured environments, offering obstacle avoidance, multi-directional force application, and a lightweight design. By placing all motors and sensors at the base and employing plastic links, we can further reduce the arm’s weight. To demonstrate this concept, we developed a 9-degree-of-freedom cable-driven serpentine manipulator with an arm length of 545 mm and a total mass of only 308 g. However, this design introduces flexibility-induced variations, such as cable slack, elongation, and link deformation. These variations result in discrepancies between analytical predictions and actual link positions, making pose estimation more challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a physical reservoir computing based pose estimation method that exploits the manipulator’s intrinsic nonlinear dynamics as a high-dimensional reservoir. Experimental results show a mean pose error of 4.3 mm using our method, compared to 4.4 mm with a baseline long short-term memory network and 39.5 mm with an analytical approach. This work provides a new direction for control and perception strategies in lightweight cable-driven serpentine manipulators leveraging their intrinsic dynamics."

With this focus, this study simulates a 33 kWp PV plant using MATLAB/Simulink, with modules representative of those used by the FAB. Four recurring anomalies on the direct current (DC) side are analyzed: dirt on the modules, cable breakage, short circuit between the negative pole and ground, and imbalance between modules. The impacts of these anomalies on electrical parameters such as voltage, current, and active and reactive power, in steady state, are evaluated. The results obtained contribute to the identification and classification of electrical signatures associated with different types of anomalies, using machine learning algorithms.

    "abstract": "LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally, many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24× faster.

Herein, we develop a stretchable tactile sensor based on the proposed continuous spectral-filtering principle, allowing superhigh resolution for applied stimuli. This proposed sensor enables a high-linear spatial response (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> > 0.996) even during stretching and bending, and high continuous spatial (7 μm) and force (5 mN) resolutions with design scalability and interaction robustness to survive piercing and cutting.

By sending an acoustic vibration from one finger to the other through an object, we gain insight into an object’s acoustic properties and contact state. We use this system to classify objects, estimate grasping position, estimate poses of internal structures, and classify the types of extrinsic contacts an object is making with the environment. Using our contact type classification model, we tackle a standard long-horizon manipulation problem: peg insertion. We use a simple simulated transition model based on the performance of our sensor to train an imitation learning policy that is robust to imperfect predictions from the classifier.

This paper investigates the development of a robot capable of high-precision recognition of the milling state. Initially, we identify vibration signals as the basis for state recognition, establishing their feasibility through theoretical analysis, which provides a foundation for the creation of datasets for subsequent milling experiments. We then conducted milling experiments using pig scapulae and designed neural networks for state identification. Vibration signals corresponding to varying milling depth and the proportion of cortical and cancellous bone layers were collected. A BiLSTM-based neural network was developed to identify the milling depth and the proportion of the bone layers, achieving the desired outcomes within an acceptable error range.The results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy in state recognition, with errors falling within an acceptable range. This research highlights the potential of integrating advanced neural networks and vibration analysis into robotic systems to enhance precision and safety in spinal surgery."

Specifically, we develop a lightweight neural network model with only 43k parameters to perform real-time distance estimation by extracting temporal information from reverberant signals. The estimated distances are then processed using an extended Kalman filter to achieve online sound source localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve online sound source localization using a single microphone on a moving robot, a gap that we aim to fill in this work.

While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird’s Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting. Our method achieves a notable IoU of 78.8% on the hidden test set of the SemanticKITTI-MOS dataset and delivers competitive results on the Apollo dataset.

However, existing robotic middleware often struggles to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RI-MAOS2C, a service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast, RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. The core mechanism of the middleware, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty, thus improving both communication efficiency and scheduling stability. Tested and validated on L4 vehicles and Jetson Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the large-message transmission bottleneck inherent in native CyberRT middleware. In scenarios involving two cross-chip subscribers, RIMAOS2C eliminates message redundancy, enhancing transmission efficiency by 36%–40% for large data transfers while reducing callback time differences by 42%–906%.

    "abstract": "Due to the high rate of fragmentation, India's healthcare system is faced with stagnant patient data that is isolated in silos involving thousands of clinics and healthcare centers. This disunity is linked to significant gaps in patient care, as individuals carry actual documents and medical professionals struggle to obtain a comprehensive clinical history when necessary. In this study, the authors analyze how blockchain can be used to resolve the healthcare interoperability crisis in India. Compared to the traditional centralized databases, blockchain establishes a distributed ledger, through which records between patients remain securely shared within approved healthcare networks. Immutable feature maintains data integrity and the decentralized system offers high security against cyber-attacks that are being perpetrated more commonly on healthcare institutions. There are three main benefits to the implementation of a blockchain identified in the study. One is increased security due to distributed storage of data that removes single-point failover which hackers usually target. Second, the enhanced interoperability will enable the easy flow of information among the public and private healthcare providers eliminating repetitive tests and delays in care. Third, greater transparency allows the patients more influence on their healthcare data, as well as improves the ability to track clinical trials and outcomes. Nevertheless, a number of problems make the adoption of blockchain in the Indian healthcare industry difficult. The cost of implementation is still extremely high in many institutions especially the smaller clinics and the rural health care providers. The current electronic health records systems have to be upgraded significantly to connect to the blockchain networks. The regulatory frameworks will have to change, such as the Personal Data Protection Bill in 2020 in India, and ensure that they support decentralized data management alongside standards of compliance. Based on the conducted research, it can be concluded that the implementation of blockchain requires the joint work of governmental institutions, healthcare facilities, and technology corporations. Though there exist some technical and financial obstacles, the capability of blockchain to build a single, safe ecosystem in the healthcare industry may bring incredible changes in patient outcomes of the wide variety of healthcare in India."

    "abstract": "The Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol, defined by the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard, introduces a bidirectional ranging approach to improve Wi-Fi positioning accuracy. Nevertheless, real-time distance measurements using FTM are susceptible to several sources of error. In this study, we conducted exploratory tests in both indoor and outdoor settings using ESP32-C3 microcontroller-based devices. A dataset comprising 240,000 FTM samples was collected to calibrate and validate optimal protocol configurations. Subsequently, the protocol's performance was assessed in an electronics manufacturing facility located in the Manaus Industrial Hub. The results demonstrated a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as low as 6.23 % under favorable conditions and a maximum Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 5.38 m in complex environments. Additionally, power consumption analysis indicated average currents of 95 mA in Access Point (AP) mode and 72.4 mA in Station (STA) mode during 1.8 ms transmissions. These findings underscore the FTM protocol's efficacy for realtime distance estimation in environments equipped with Wi-Fi infrastructure."

This study aimed to analyze, through an integrative literature review, how different countries structure their regulatory systems with a focus on the integration of epidemiological, demographic, and mortality data. The methodology involved a systematic search in the PubMed and Scopus databases, resulting in the selection of 178 articles published between 2015 and 2025. The findings reveal a growing interest in digital and interoperable solutions, with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence, real-time surveillance, and data-driven triage systems. It was observed that governance models vary across countries; however, there is a consensus on the need for systemic integration to promote equity and efficiency. It is concluded that the improvement of systems such as SISREG requires the adoption of international best practices, focusing on interoperable infrastructure, intelligent prioritization, and collaborative governance, to achieve more effective regulation within the context of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS)."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles that navigate in open-world environments may encounter previously unseen object classes. However, most existing LiDAR panoptic segmentation models rely on closed-set assumptions, failing to detect unknown object instances. In this work, we propose ULOPS, an uncertainty-guided open-set panoptic segmentation framework that leverages Dirichlet-based evidential learning to model predictive uncertainty. Our architecture incorporates separate decoders for semantic segmentation with uncertainty estimation, embedding with prototype association, and instance center prediction. During inference, we leverage uncertainty estimates to identify and segment unknown instances. To strengthen the model’s ability to differentiate between known and unknown objects, we introduce three uncertainty-driven loss functions. Uniform Evidence Loss to encourage high uncertainty in unknown regions. Adaptive Uncertainty Separation Loss ensures a consistent difference in uncertainty estimates between known and unknown objects at a global scale. Contrastive Uncertainty Loss refines this separation at the fine-grained level. To evaluate open-set performance, we extend benchmark settings on KITTI-360 and introduce a new open-set evaluation for nuScenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULOPS consistently outperforms existing open-set LiDAR panoptic segmentation methods. We make the code and pre-trained models available at http://ulops.cs.uni-freiburg.de."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the multi-robot pursuit problem for an unknown target, encompassing both target state estimation and pursuit control. First, in state estimation, we focus on using only bearing information, as it is readily available from vision sensors and effective for small, distant targets. Challenges such as instability due to the nonlinearity of bearing measurements and singularities in the two-angle representation are addressed through a proposed uniform bearing-only information filter. This filter integrates multiple 3D bearing measurements, provides a concise formulation, and enhances stability and resilience to target loss caused by limited field of view (FoV). Second, in target pursuit control within complex environments, where challenges such as heterogeneity and limited FoV arise, conventional methods like differential games or Voronoi partitioning often prove inadequate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, enabling multiple heterogeneous vehicles to search, localize, and follow a target while effectively handling those challenges. Third, to bridge the sim-to-real gap, we propose two key techniques: incorporating adjustable low-level control gains in training to replicate the dynamics of real-world autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), and proposing spectral-normalized RL algorithms to enhance policy smoothness and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the successful zero-shot transfer of the MARL controllers to AGVs, validating the effectiveness and practical feasibility of our approach.

    "abstract": "Depth estimation has been widely studied and serves as the fundamental step of 3D perception for robotics and autonomous driving. Though significant progress has been made in monocular depth estimation in the past decades, these attempts are mainly conducted on the KITTI benchmark with only front-view cameras, which ignores the correlations across surround-view cameras. In this paper, we propose an Adjacent-View Transformer for Supervised Surround-view Depth estimation (AVT-SSDepth), to jointly predict the depth maps across multiple surrounding cameras. Specifically, we employ a global-to-local feature extraction module that combines CNN with transformer layers for enriched representations. Further, the adjacent-view attention mechanism is proposed to enable the intra-view and inter-view feature propagation. The former is achieved by the self-attention module within each view, while the latter is realized by the adjacent attention module, which computes the attention across multi-cameras to exchange the multi-scale representations across surround-view feature maps. In addition, AVT-SSDepth has strong cross-dataset generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods on both DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, the robustness of the diffusion planner is inherently dependent on the diversity of the pre-collected datasets. To mitigate this issue, we propose a two-stage learning framework to enhance the capability of the diffusion planner under limited dataset (reward-agnostic). Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planner, which significantly diversified the original behavior and thus improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under different speeds and can perform a zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

Traditional camera control can increase cognitive workload, lead to suboptimal camera viewpoints, and complicate surgical tasks. We propose an autonomous camera system that uses situational awareness and real-time prediction of user intent from kinematic data, and adjusts the camera position dynamically during a simulated suturing task. Such a system reduces the need to manually adjust the camera, allowing users to stay focused on the procedure. We demonstrated the framework in a user study with eight non-expert participants. They used the da Vinci Research Kit to control a simulated camera and instruments in a suturing task. We compared the performances in the suturing task with the autonomous and the teleoperated camera control. The autonomous system reduced execution time by 43% , shortened path length by 30% , and decreased completion cost by 35%. These results serve as a proof of concept for a situationally aware camera system and suggest that autonomous camera control can improve efficiency and simplify surgical workflow."

Manipulating granular food items, such as rice and beans, poses significant challenges due to their dynamic physical properties. Learning from human demonstrations offers a promising solution, but acquiring high-quality demonstrations is complex. To address this, we present VERAGMIL, a framework that combines a high-fidelity simulator with an intuitive Virtual Reality (VR) interface for recording demonstrations and supporting different imitation learning methods. VERAGMIL provides a realistic environment for training RAF systems to handle granular materials, including robots, sensors, and various food items with distinct physical characteristics. We evaluate VERAGMIL by training three imitation learning models—BC, BC-RNN, and BCQ—on granular scooping and transporting tasks using both VR interface and 3D space mouse demonstrations, comparing them with a human-expert baseline. The models are assessed on success rate, spillage, generalization to unseen food items, and task completion time. Results show that VR-based demonstrations significantly outperform 3D space mouse data, with BCQ achieving the best overall performance, particularly in reducing spillage and approaching human performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework for training RAF systems in granular material handling.

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) can cause great pain for dogs, limit their daily activities and negatively affect their quality of life. In most veterinary practices, evaluating pain caused by OA is done by veterinary professionals performing examinations and making subjective assessments. In this study, we proposed a novel objective approach using a wearable device equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to collect high-frequency movement data from dogs and to use machine learning methods to analyze pain status from 28 dogs. Using manifold learning, we were able to generate natural clusters between healthy dogs and those affected by OA pain. Using four simple supervised learning methods and manually extracted movement features as input, we achieved high performance using certain input data streams (100% precision for OA-pain affected dogs, 83% recall and 89% overall classification accuracy). Furthermore, using a custom neural network model, we achieved the best performance of 71% precision, 92% recall and 72% accuracy using raw IMU data as input. As a preliminary study, we also explored the use of a specific task data against using all the data from the entire session to compare the prediction performance. We also compared the prediction capabilities of different input data streams. Although preliminary, the results were promising and indicated that IMU data and machine learning methods could be further leveraged to achieve an owner-conducted early OA pain screening process in an at-home environment where dogs are most comfortable."

To solve this problem, we propose a framework that uses serialized Finite State Machine (FSM) to generate demonstrations and improve the success rate in manipulation tasks requiring a long sequence of precise interactions. To validate its effectiveness, we use environmentally evolving and long-horizon puzzles that require long sequential actions. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a success rate of up to 98% in these tasks, compared to the controlled condition using existing approaches, which only had a success rate of up to 60%, and, in some tasks, almost failed completely.

    "abstract": "Video streaming based teleoperation often faces a trade-off between bandwidth consumption and the need for high-fidelity telepresence. Higher image resolution or a wider field of view (FOV) substantially increases bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel telepresence model for teleoperated vehicles operating in bandwidth-constrained environments. Our approach employs a LiDAR-fused 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a compact scene representation to efficiently generate remote views. Initially, a static point cloud map is constructed using LiDAR-based semantic mapping, which serves as the initial Gaussians for optimizing the 3DGS model. During teleoperation, the prebuilt 3DGS is then rendered on the teleoperation platform, while only safety-critical information, such as vehicle pose and dynamic objects, is transmitted from the vehicle to the teleoperator in real-time. The proposed telepresence model significantly reduces data transmission requirements while maintaining photorealistic telepresence, enabling reliable and effective teleoperation even under stringent bandwidth constraints. This capability ensures safe and efficient vehicle teleoperation under challenging environments without relying on traditional high-bandwidth communication, thereby broadening the applicability of teleoperation technology to more demanding and diverse operational scenarios. Real-world experimental results show that the developed system can provide immersive teleoperation experiences at Kbps-level bandwidth consumption."

This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost.

    "abstract": "In this article, we present the Layered Semantic Graphs (LSG), a novel actionable hierarchical scene graph, fully integrated with a multi-modal mission planner, the FLIE: A First-Look based Inspection and Exploration planner [1]. The novelty of this work stems from aiming to address the task of maintaining an intuitive and multi-resolution scene representation, while simultaneously offering a tractable foundation for planning and scene understanding during an ongoing inspection mission of apriori unknown targets-of-interest in an unknown environment. The proposed LSG scheme is composed of locally nested hierarchical graphs, at multiple layers of abstraction, with the abstract concepts grounded on the functionality of the integrated FLIE planner. Furthermore, LSG encapsulates real-time semantic segmentation models that offer extraction and localization of desired semantic elements within the hierarchical representation. This extends the capability of the inspection planner, which can then leverage LSG to make an informed decision to inspect a particular semantic of interest. We also emphasize the hierarchical and semantic path-planning capabilities of LSG, which could extend inspection missions by improving situational awareness for human operators in an unknown environment. The validity of the proposed scheme is proven through extensive evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulations, as well as experimental field deployments on a Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot in urban outdoor environment settings."

    "abstract": "Tennis is widely popular across various age groups. However, mastering fluid stroke mechanics remains a significant challenge, requiring substantial time and practice. The lack of scientifically grounded tools for skill acquisition and training tools further hampers the development of tennis proficiency. In this paper, we investigate the application of an intelligent tennis robot equipped with advanced human-machine interaction capabilities, designed to serve as an effective tool for tennis learners, especially for enhancing motion geometry and coordination. First, we detail the design and development of the intelligent tennis robot, highlighting its core functions and operational principles, including ball serving, human motion sensing, and motion feedback mechanisms. Subsequently, we introduce a novel human motion analysis method that integrates motion geometry and kinematic analyses. Following this, we present a real-time motion feedback system that identifies deficiencies in players' movements, thereby facilitating the enhancement of their motion memory. Finally, we conduct experiments over players of varying skill levels, analyzing their motion patterns and providing practical examples. The proposed human-machine interaction framework offers a pioneering solution for intelligent tennis training, enabling players to understand their movements and correct errors immediately after each stroke."

    "abstract": "A two-degree-of-freedom parallel mechanism control system based on an adaptive learning rate and radial basis function (RBF) neural network controller is studied in this paper. The mechanism is composed of four pneumatic artificial muscles(PAM), forming two pairs of antagonistic single-degree-of-freedom joints, which enable two-degree-of-freedom motion along the X and Y axes. The core objective of the system is to automatically output the air pressure values for the X and Y axes based on the input desired angle, driving the joints to precisely reach the specified angle. In this research, dynamic modeling of the two pairs of driving joints composed of four pneumatic muscles was conducted, analyzing the motion characteristics of the system. Subsequently, an RBF neural network was employed to approximate system modeling errors and external disturbances, combined with a PID controller to optimize the driving performance of the pneumatic muscles. The stability of the controller was proven by designing the Lyapunov function, ensuring that the system remains stable during dynamic changes. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB/Simulink to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the control algorithm enables the actual angle to track the desired angle in real-time, with high control accuracy and stability. This research provides a new solution for the precise control of pneumatic muscle-driven parallel joint systems, with broad application prospects, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional PAM control methods that require precise modeling and suffer from poor robustness."

    "abstract": "Developing robotic systems for unstructured and contact-rich environments presents significant challenges, necessitating advanced dexterous motion planning, compliant interaction control, and spatio-temporal coordination. To address these, we introduce PACR (Point-Axis Constraint Reasoning), an unified framework that encodes robot trajectories and impedance profiles via constraint functions parameterized by point-axis primitives, extracted from multi-view RGB-D camera observations. This enables joint optimization of motion and impedance within a shared mathematical framework. For enhanced robustness, we implement a dual-agent Vision-Language Model (VLM) system: a Generator employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to formulate constraints, while an adversarial Critic validates them, significantly mitigating hallucination risks. Integrated with the dual-agent system, the framework also features an error backtracking mechanism, enabling dynamic adaptation by learning from failures. Extensive experiments across diverse manipulation tasks reveal that PACR achieves a 61% success rate (compared to 37% for baseline methods) and reduces the average contact forces, demonstrating broad applicability through zero-shot generalization without task-specific training."

This study investigated multiple effective methods for feature fusion for volumetric medical image segmentation in 3D U-Net architecture. The Brats 2024 (BraTS-GLI) dataset was used to perform six fusion methods (Early Fusion, Mid-Level Fusion, Late Fusion, Attention-Based Fusion, Transformer-based Fusion, and Hybrid Fusion \\{Deep + Handcrafted\\}). Data preprocessing was done in a pipeline, which consisted of resizing, normalization, and label relabeling in order to provide all models with the same input. The aim was to see to what extent the method of fusion selection may affect the model's performance in accurately segmentation the tumor area. Among the various models tested, Attention-Based Fusion was demonstrated to be the most powerful and reproducible, facilitating a consistent performance from training to testing while capturing majority of the relevant features from each modal. While other methods like Late Fusion performed well, these strategies had less generalization. This work emphasizes the importance of intelligent feature fusion design in developing and improving deep learning-based medical image segmentation systems."

    "abstract": "The generation of temporally consistent, high-fidelity driving videos over extended horizons presents a fundamental challenge in autonomous driving world modeling. Existing approaches often suffer from error accumulation and feature misalignment due to inadequate decoupling of spatio-temporal dynamics and limited cross-frame feature propagation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we present STAGE (Streaming Temporal Attention Generative Engine), a novel auto-regressive framework that pioneers hierarchical feature coordination and multi-phase optimization for sustainable video synthesis. To achieve high-quality long-horizon driving video generation, we introduce Hierarchical Temporal Feature Transfer (HTFT) and a novel multi-stage training strategy. HTFT enhances temporal consistency between video frames throughout the video generation process by modeling the temporal and denoising process separately and transferring denoising features between frames. The multi-stage training strategy is to divide the training into three stages, through model decoupling and auto-regressive inference process simulation, thereby accelerating model convergence and reducing error accumulation. Experiments on the Nuscenes dataset show that STAGE has significantly surpassed existing methods in the long-horizon driving video generation task. In addition, we also explored STAGE’s ability to generate unlimited-length driving videos. We generated 600 frames of high-quality driving videos on the Nuscenes dataset, which far exceeds the maximum length achievable by existing methods.

    "abstract": "In this work, we highlight vulnerabilities in robotic systems integrating large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) due to input modality sensitivities. While LLM/VLM-controlled robots show impressive performance across various tasks, their reliability under slight input variations remains underexplored yet critical. These models are highly sensitive to instruction or perceptual input changes, which can trigger misalignment issues, leading to execution failures with severe real-world consequences. To study this issue, we analyze the misalignment-induced vulnerabilities within LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems and present a mathematical formulation for failure modes arising from variations in input modalities. We propose empirical perturbation strategies to expose these vulnerabilities and validate their effectiveness through experiments on multiple robot manipulation tasks. Our results show that simple input perturbations reduce task execution success rates by 22.2% and 14.6% in two representative LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems. These findings underscore the importance of input modality robustness and motivate further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of advanced LLM/VLM-controlled robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Currently, the investigation and analysis of accurate methods for measuring power grid frequency is an important task due to the significant impact of frequency deviations on the stable operation of equipment. One of the popular digital frequency measurement methods is based on amplitude spectrum analysis of the input signal. The main cause of measurement error is the spectral leakage effect, which leads to distortion of the measured spectral component. This effect occurs due to the deviation of the input signal frequency from its nominal value. To reduce the impact of this effect, window functions and spectral samples interpolation are used. This method has been well-known for a long time, but the influence of ADC instrumental errors on measurement accuracy has not been studied so far. Within the framework of this article, the influence of additive, multiplicative, and linearity errors is considered. Linearity is represented as a 3rd-order polynomial function and a pseudo-random function, as well as by the “worst-case” method. The measurement errors from the instrumental errors of the ADC are estimated for different frequency deviation values and for different bit depth in the case of using three-point interpolation using the Matlab."

    "abstract": "LiDAR odometry has gained popularity due to the LiDAR sensor’s accurate depth measurement and robustness to varying illumination conditions. The feature-based methods achieve the advantage of efficiency through feature extraction, while the distribution-based ones attain better accuracy by modeling the point cloud as distributions. Combining the strengths of both methods is anticipated to yield superior performance. However, existing combination schemes typically extract and process features and distributions separately, and such a loosely integrated approach cannot fully leverage their complementarity. To address this problem, we propose a novel LiDAR odometry method based on surface distributed point (SDP) feature with dual feature fusion. Specifically, the SDP feature is introduced to tightly integrate features and distributions, facilitating efficient feature association and map maintenance. On this basis, the associated source and target features are then effectively integrated through dual feature fusion to form the dual-fusion (DF) associated plane. This plane serves as the basis for constructing the point-to-DF associated plane constraint for pose optimization. As a result, the local planar structure is more accurately reflected, thereby enhancing the accuracy of pose estimation. The SDP feature and the resultant constraint are employed in both scan-to-map matching and fixed-lag smoothing, which are hierarchically organized to achieve accurate pose estimation. Experiments on KITTI dataset and large-scale KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "In the oil and gas industry, scale accumulation on radiant coils within furnaces significantly reduces heat-transfer efficiency, leading to increased energy consumption. This paper introduces the REFINE-bot, a robotic system developed to improve the descaling process and operational efficiency in fired heaters. Unlike existing solutions which are mainly designed for specific tube sizes and positions and focused on inspection, the REFINE-bot integrates an adaptable clamping mechanism that adapts to both vertical and horizontal tubes of varying diameters (3\"–8\"), even in complex environments with narrow tube-to-tube and wall-to-tube gaps. An adaptive force control is also developed to online adjust the position of the cleaning relative to the tube surface to address uneven scale heights. We evaluated three different cleaning tools—a Knot End Brush, Wire Cup Brush, and Sandpaper—under simulated hard scale conditions in a lab environment. This evaluation revealed the cleaning tools’ limitations and helped to identify optimal safety parameters to prevent tube damage. The results showed that the 1-inch Wire Cup Brush, removing 431.1 μm of scale, achieved the highest descaling rate among the tested tools. The robot was successfully deployed in a real furnace setting to test its clamping and cleaning mechanisms on the actual scale. The real-world results demonstrated superior cleaning performance on the radiant coils of a furnace compared to traditional manual descaling methods, as evaluated by measured reductions in scale thickness and infrared thermal imaging. Furthermore, ultrasonic thickness measurements (UTM) were performed and indicated that there was no significant loss in wall thickness after the on-site experiments."

However, variations in patient anatomy and complex human-in-the-loop interactions pose significant challenges for autonomous robotic scanning. Existing ultrasound scanning robots are commonly limited to relatively low generalization and inefficient data utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera images, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning of carotid artery. We propose a specialized guidance module to enable the policy to output actions that center the artery in ultrasound images. To ensure stable contact and safe interaction between the robot and the human subject, a hybrid force-impedance controller is utilized to drive the robot to track such trajectories. Also, we have built a large-scale training dataset for carotid scanning comprising 210 scans with 460k sample pairs from 21 volunteers of both genders. By exploring our guidance module and DP’s strong generalization ability, UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness."

Traditional feature-based methods suffer from failures due to poor lighting, insufficient texture, and large motions. In contrast, recent learning-based dense SLAM methods exploit iterative dense bundle adjustment to address such failure cases, and achieve robust and accurate localization in a wide variety of real environments, without depending on domain-specific supervision. However, despite its potential, the methods still struggle with scenarios involving large motion and object dynamics. In this study, we diagnose key weaknesses in a popular learning-based dense SLAM model (DROID-SLAM) by analyzing major failure cases on outdoor benchmarks and exposing various shortcomings of its optimization process. We then propose the use of self-supervised priors leveraging a frozen large-scale pre-trained monocular depth estimator to initialize the dense bundle adjustment process, leading to robust visual odometry without the need to fine-tune the SLAM backbone.

Most safety research for mobile robots target at maintaining safety with the notion of collision avoidance. However, safety goes beyond just avoiding collisions, especially when robots have to navigate unstructured, vertically challenging, off-road terrain, where vehicle rollover and immobilization is as critical as collisions. In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position. T-CBF planner outperforms previously developed planners by 30% in terms of keeping the robot safe and mobile when navigating on real world vertically challenging terrain."

    "abstract": "The detection of microcracks in solar panels is critical for maintaining their efficiency and longevity, particularly in industrial-scale solar farms. Microcracks, which often form due to hail impact, are imperceptible to the naked eye and cannot be identified through conventional visual or drone inspections. Electroluminescence (EL) imaging is required to capture these microcracks, as it enables the visualization of internal defects in photovoltaic (PV) cells. However, current inspection processes rely heavily on manual analysis of EL images, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study proposes an automated computer vision-based approach for detecting and classifying microcracks in solar panels using EL imaging. The model is trained and evaluated on a newly developed dataset comprising EL images captured after controlled hail impact tests conducted at the research campus of Factory Mutual (FM). Despite the modest dataset size, our deep learning-based model achieves high detection performance, demonstrating the viability of accurate microcrack analysis under data-limited conditions. Furthermore, we show that targeted data augmentation techniques substantially improve model robustness and generalization. The proposed method provides a scalable and efficient alternative to manual inspection, contributing toward the broader goal of automated and reliable defect detection in PV systems."

    "abstract": "Series elastic actuators (SEAs) achieve output torque and stiffness control by managing the deformation of a spring arranged between the motor and the output. SEAs are ideal for tasks involving human-robot interaction and unstructured environments. The stiffness, size, and torque capacity of the spring are crucial for the performance of an SEA. To increase the torque capacity of an SEA while maintaining a compact size, this paper proposes a novel helical flexure as the spring in an SEA. The helical flexure is formed on the thin wall of a tube to generate high torque output with minimal reaction forces and moments. The resulting compliant tube can be combined with other transmission components to reduce the number of components and allow the inner passage of cables and shafts. Simulation comparisons and experimental testing verify the merits of the proposed helical flexure. An SEA prototype is fabricated to demonstrate the performance of the new helical flexure during zero-torque and high-torque motion."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the digits by 400% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully performed 86% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the design’s ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications."

In this paper, an adaptive Cartesian position control for robotic manipulators with mixed rigid-elastic joints is presented. Adaptive controllers are designed to deal with uncertainties in the parameters of the motors, while robust control signals effectively cope with uncertainties of the links and stiffness of the elastic joints. Furthermore, a switching strategy between Cartesian space position control and joint space position control when the end-effector comes into the vicinity of the target point is proposed. This switching strategy helps to keep the pose of the robotic manipulator stable when the end-effector has approached the target point. Simulation results on a 6-DOF robotic manipulator demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve the desired accuracy in position and maintain a stable pose when the end-effector reaches the target."

The values of the percolation threshold and the dimensions of the conductive network of filler particles in the studied composites were determined. It was found that the type of polymer matrix does not have a significant effect on the shape of single carbon nanotubes, but can cause their agglomeration. The results clarify the role of the polymer matrix in determining the percolation threshold and the formation of conductive networks."

Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between a human and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin inflated profiles, and maintains the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings when deflated. We develop and validate a model relating geometric design specifications to fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer."

The asymmetric ICEO phenomenon is generated by symmetry breaking in the induced charge distributions of geometrically anisotropic NdFeB particles under AC electric field polarization. The DEP forces exerted on NdFeB particles are induced by the light-generated non-uniform electric field. Under the combined action of hydrodynamic forces from asymmetric ICEO vortices and positive DEP forces, NdFeB particles can be attracted into light-induced \"virtual\" electrodes and precisely track along light-defined trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that the maximum motion speed of the NdFeB particles exceeds 300 μm/s, with the motion speed exhibiting a positive correlation with the applied voltage. Dynamically controlled virtual electrodes enable accurate capture and relocation of microparticles to arbitrary target positions. The stirring and mixing capability of the NdFeB particles is demonstrated by driving yeast cell motion."

Control signals with appropriate displacement phases and different voltages are used to control the water pump to drive the soft actuator to bend to generate a sine wave with increasing amplitude along the body axis. We test customized tail materials, phase shifts, and voltage growth rate signals to observe the effects of different parameters on the movement of the snake robot in water. Experiments show that the movement speed is positively correlated with the swing amplitude of the snake robot's motion module. In addition, measured data show that swimming efficiency and movement speed are also affected by tail flexibility and movement gait. When the phase offset is 2/3π, the tail is made of harder PLA material, and the voltage growth rate is 1.2, the maximum underwater movement speed achieved by the snake robot is 4.464 cm/s (0.076 BL/s). We also found that when the phase offset increases, the snake motion speed and motion efficiency first increase and then decrease. The results obtained in this study will aid in the advancement of soft, slender swimming robots and improve the understanding of the swimming capabilities of both robots and sea snakes."

Wave energy converters (WECs), operating in stochastic and highly dynamic marine environments, require the capacity to adjust key system parameters in response to changing sea states to optimise performance and durability. This study proposes a feedforward predictive stiffness adaptation methodology for a WEC, employing polynomial Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average with Exogenous Inputs (NARMAX) models. By forecasting future system dynamics, the method enables the adjustment of the power take-off (PTO) stiffness according to predicted mechanical energy levels, following a threshold-based policy. Numerical simulations on the Reference Model 3 (RM3) WEC under four representative sea states illustrate that the approach achieves reductions in average stiffness of up to 47 % relative to the nominal setting. The results demonstrate the potential of predictive adaptation techniques to support renewable energy operations through enhanced system resilience and sustainable performance."

To address this limitation, we introduce Multi-Modal Dex, a dataset that integrates multimodal sensory data to enable the effective learning of dexterous skills from human demonstrations. By combining visual, point cloud, and kinematic modalities, our dataset provides a richer representation of hand interactions, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of dexterous imitation. Our framework leverages neural rendering and kinematic optimization to align human and robotic hand poses in a shared canonical space, enabling geometrically consistent skill transfer. Furthermore, we analyze the dataset’s potential to advance dexterous robots in perception, imitation learning, and real-world dexterous skill transfer.

Current fisheye perception algorithms often overlook the misalignment issues that typically arise in object detectors. To tackle these challenges in the feature pyramid network (FPN), we introduce a feature-aligned pyramid module (FaPM), which learns pixel transformation offsets to contextually align feature maps. Additionally, we present a location-aligned detection head (LaDH) to align the spatial distribution of classification and regression localization. Integrating these modules into a detection framework results in a novel feature-aligned fisheye object detector. Our method undergoes extensive evaluation on the WoodScape dataset, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 32.2%, surpassing the performance of existing methods."

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a fitness function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes a deformation for the previous trajectory with the current denoising process, allows anytime refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI. In a 2D holonomic case with 16 robots, it is almost twice as fast. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency, reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup. Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a volunteer scan."

To address these issues, we creatively propose a Progressive Comprehension and Geometric-topology Perception Enhancement (PCGE) one-stage framework, which decouples the task into keypoint estimation and size regression under textual constraints. Specifically, to enable coarse-to-fine keypoint estimation, we propose the STAR module to focus the target region approximately with a scene-specific reasoning mechanism, while the K2C module performs geometric calibration to alleviate pseudo-center bias. For size regression, we propose GTE to enhance the geometric boundary perception during the decoding process, improving size regression via establishing topological matrices.

However, existing intelligent medical care assistants are mainly oriented to the medical professional community, and patients with non-medical backgrounds face many challenges when using AI-assisted self-diagnosis. In this paper, a knowledge graph is introduced to enhance the assisted diagnosis capability of multimodal macrolanguage modeling for geriatric ophthalmic diseases. The approach generates final conclusions by systematically decomposing complex problems into sub-problems, reasoning using the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM), and combining inference graphs and implicit knowledge. In the ncbi/Hidden-flaws-GPT-4V benchmark test, this method outperforms the existing models in terms of inference depth and accuracy: the accuracy is improved by 3.37% compared to MM-CoT-Base and 0.94% compared to DDCoT. Experiments show that the multimodal knowledge graph-driven approach proposed in this study exhibits superior reasoning performance and interpretability in both medical Q&amp;A and ocular disease diagnosis tasks. It can integrate patients' multimodal medical care data to provide accurate and personalized care recommendations and predictions for localized contexts."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) do not construct conceptual representations in ways that align with human cognition, posing risks for human-AI interaction. While LLMs solely rely on linguistic distributional knowledge, humans leverage both linguistic and sensorimotor knowledge. To systematically assess human-LLM alignment in concept representations, we propose a novel evaluation framework based on sensorimotor regularities, operationalized as image schemas—multimodal gestalts derived from repeated sensorimotor experiences. Investigating linguistic manifestations of such schemas, we systematically identify human-LLM alignments and misalignments in the encoding of sensorimotor regularities. Results indicate that three contemporary disembodied LLMs encode highly human-like sensorimotor gestalts. However, these models exhibit reduced alignment when mapping such gestalts to concepts, and they do not systematically combine these gestalts in ways consistent with human patterns. We identify each LLM’s misalignments with human patterns in image schema distribution, conceptual associations, and image schema co-occurrences. Building on these findings, we augment gpt-4-1106 with targeted sensorimotor priors derived from its identified misalignments with human patterns. In a downstream user study, this augmentation yields sentence continuations rated by humans as significantly more conceptually clear, contextually contingent, and human-like than baseline outputs. Our work establishes a foundation for evaluating and improving human-LLM alignment at the conceptual level."

No estudo, empregou-se uma câmera termográfica de baixo custo para registrar imagens térmicas do interior das colmeias, as quais foram analisadas por uma Rede Neural Convolucional (RNC) treinada com um conjunto de 251 imagens de colmeias classificadas como ativas, hipoativas ou inativas. O modelo foi implementado na biblioteca de aprendizado profundo de código aberto PyTorch e, após 50 épocas de treinamento, atingiu 93,33% de acurácia na classificação de imagens inéditas. A métrica F1-Score também apresentou desempenho elevado (95,15%), evidenciando a robustez do modelo, por equilibrar a precisão (redução de falsos positivos) e a revocação (redução de falsos negativos).

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of individual cells in tissue with the resolution of a single cell. However, “dropouts” will lead to an excess of zeros in the scRNA-seq data due to technical constraints, which could hinder further analysis. Consequently, imputing the dropout values becomes particularly critical in assisting with the recovery of biological information. Herein, we propose a dual-branch imputation method for scRNA seq data, which helps to impute the drops in scRNA-seq data. Unlike previous methods which assume a preconceived structure guiding to impute the dropouts, we believe that there are linear and non-linear associations that help structure the data, thus, both linear and non-linear pipelines are combined for dropout imputation. The evaluation and comprehensive downstream results on both simulated and real datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for recovery of gene expression, cell clustering, differential expression analysis, and pseudo-time trajectory analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Cloud-based data sharing has emerged as a prevailing solution for enterprises and end users, supporting various online services in our daily lives. However, the current cloud security solutions are vulnerable to the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat imposed by future quantum computers. To encounter the threat, lattice-based cryptographic solutions for supporting cloud data encryption and search have been extensively investigated by both academia and industry. Despite these efforts, existing lattice-based schemes fall into a trilemma: (1) lack of efficient access control for data retrieval; (2) inadequate protection of keyword privacy in both ciphertext and search token; and (3) difficulty in realizing forward secrecy to safeguard historical data. These limitations result in a substantial burden for lattice-based solutions to be adopted in real-world cloud data sharing. To our knowledge, no prior work has comprehensively addressed these issues at the same time, motivating us to design a more flexible, efficient, and secure lattice-based solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving, and forward-secure data sharing framework centered around a novel primitive called Forward-Secure Authenticated Searchable Encryption (FS-ASE). Specifically, we first construct an Authenticated Searchable Encryption (ASE) scheme based on ideal lattices, enabling efficient one-to-many search functionality and ensuring keyword privacy in both ciphertext and search token. On top of this primitive, we present the FS-ASE scheme, which achieves forward secrecy through a highly efficient key evolution mechanism, thereby keeping the confidentiality of historical data even if the current secret key is compromised. Finally, the security of our construction is proven under the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) assumption, and experimental results show that it achieves performance improvements of 158× in data retrieval and 350× in token generation over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating its practicality in real use."

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction is essential for modern transportation systems, enhancing traffic management and urban planning. Accurate predictions of traffic flow and speed are crucial for understanding road usage, mitigating congestion, and providing real-time traffic monitoring and dynamic route guidance, thus improving road safety and infrastructure efficiency. Traditional research has often focused on predicting traffic flow or speed independently, leading to higher resource consumption due to the need for separate models. Few studies have explored the simultaneous prediction of both metrics, with recent attempts failing to account for spatial correlations, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose MTNet, a multi-task learning framework for joint traffic flow and speed prediction. MTNet employs a Transformer-like Encoder-Decoder architecture to process and enhance feature representations, capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations. Specifically, MTNet extracts intra-task dependencies using a cross-task interaction module and models task-specific spatiotemporal dependencies using spatial and temporal-aware modules with cascaded residual structures. Additionally, spatio-temporal positional encoding is integrated to increase awareness of long-term and long-distance dependencies. Extensive experiments on three diverse traffic datasets-Manchester, PeMSD4, and PeMSD8-demonstrate that MTNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both traffic flow and speed prediction. MTNet achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and efficiency, striking an optimal balance between performance and computational resource usage."

    "abstract": "Estimating the 3D alignment of migratory insects is essential for understanding their 3D directional behavior. The existing approach reconstructs 3D alignment using azimuthal angle measurements from dual-view entomological radars. However, the measurement errors often propagate into the reconstructed 3D alignment, causing significant inaccuracies, especially under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To overcome this problem, this letter proposes a new method based on a multi-view, multi-frequency, and full-polarization entomological radar system. The method directly estimates insect 3D alignment by integrating polarization scattering matrices (SMs) from multiple views and frequencies, leveraging the assumption of scattering symmetry in insect bodies. For symmetric targets, the off-diagonal SM elements vanish when the polarization direction aligns with the symmetry plane. Based on this theory, an optimization problem is formulated to estimate 3D alignment by minimizing the sum of the powers of off-diagonal elements across multi-view and multi-frequency SMs. Both simulations and field experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantially higher accuracy than the traditional method."

A concise measurement tool for the steroids in clinical plasma with a wide detection range, ultra-low detection limit, and high detection speed is strongly desired for patients’ clinical diagnosis. Here, we report a highly integrated label-free DNA aptamer-modified electrical biosensor based on graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) that fulfills all the afore-mentioned requirements. The proposed biosensor is designed for the direct detection of multiple steroid hormones in clinical plasma. It achieves high specificity through the immobilization of highly specific DNA aptamers using cross-linking chemistry on the GFET channel surface. To improve sensitivity, a 10 kDa polyethylene glycol polymer is employed on the graphene surface, increasing the Debye length to approximately 11 nm, which enables the detection of steroid molecules of similar sizes. In clinical plasma, the platform demonstrates a low detection limit of ~1 fM for representative steroid targets, with a wide dynamic range spanning 11 orders of magnitude. In addition, the detection process can complete within 15 minutes, which is 10 times faster than the conventional optical methods. These results offer strong potential for practical clinical usage of electronic biosensor in future point-of-care (POCT) applications."

    "abstract": "In structured light 3D measurement systems, nonlinear response of the instrument has long been recognized as a primary factor limiting the accuracy of fringe projection profilometry (FPP). Existing nonlinear error correction methods typically suffer from inherent trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, limited adaptability to varying nonlinear characteristics, and poor generalization capability. These persistent challenges continue to pose significant barriers to further advancements in measurement precision and system adaptability. To this end, we propose a novel nonlinear error correction method for FPP based on shifted-phase Hilbert transform (SPHT). Specifically, we develop a comprehensive SPHT theoretical framework that deeply integrates phase-shifting strategies with Hilbert transform techniques, thereby establishing a unified nonlinear correction approach applicable to arbitrary N-step phase-shifting schemes. Thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method can effectively eliminate high-order harmonics of order below 2N+1 in N-step phase-shifting schemes, while exhibiting excellent noise robustness, thereby achieving significant error suppression without sacrificing measurement efficiency or robust applicability. Comprehensive experiments validate the superior accuracy, efficiency, and generalization of our method, ultimately advancing the precision and reliability of 3D reconstruction."

However, conventional supply chain optimization models often overlook crucial sustainability goals and cyber vulnerabilities, leaving systems susceptible to both ecological harm and malicious attacks.To tackle these challenges simultaneously, this work integrates a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that unifies carbon footprint reduction, inventory management, and cryptographic-like security measures. We design a quantum-inspired reinforcement learning framework that couples a controllable spin-chain analogy with real-time AIoT signals and optimizes a multi-objective reward unifying fidelity, security, and carbon costs. The approach learns robust policies with stabilized training via value-based and ensemble updates, supported by window-normalized reward components to ensure commensurate scaling. In simulation, the method exhibits smooth convergence, strong late-episode performance, and graceful degradation under representative noise channels, outperforming standard learned and model-based references, highlighting its robust handling of real-time sustainability and risk demands. These findings reinforce the potential for quantum-inspired AIoT frameworks to drive secure, eco-conscious supply chain operations at scale, laying the groundwork for globally connected infrastructures that responsibly meet both consumer and environmental needs."

    "abstract": "The VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) is emerging as a next-generation standard for maritime wireless communication, extending the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and voice services with higher data rates. Although the Secure Communication (SECOM) protocol provides end-to-end protection at the application layer, it does not support link-layer broadcast authentication, which is essential in open maritime environments. This paper proposes a lightweight, delay-tolerant authentication framework for VDES that enables secure broadcast messaging without requiring modifications to the existing infrastructure. The layered framework integrates Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) at the link layer with SECOM at the application layer. A systematic parameterization strategy was developed to address maritime-specific constraints, including burst loss, synchronization errors, and vessel mobility. Analytical modeling and MATLAB-based simulations were conducted to evaluate authentication reliability, latency, and resistance to forgery. The proposed TESLA-based scheme achieved high success rates, low delay, and strong robustness against forgery across diverse operating conditions. The recommended configuration (80-bit MAC, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">int</sub> = 500 ms, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i> = 2) demonstrated reliable performance with minimal overhead, thereby ensuring suitability for resource-constrained maritime networks.

    "abstract": "Remarkable progress has been achieved in the detection and segmentation of the baseline; however, for high-level visual tasks in complex scenes (e.g., dense, occlusion, scale diversity, high background noise, etc.), existing frameworks often fail to provide satisfactory performance. To further improve the object recognition ability, this article introduces a leader-based multiexpert mechanism into the detection and segmentation tasks. In this work, we first design a leader-based attention learning layer to fully integrate multilevel features from the backbone network, which can effectively obtain global semantics and assign instructions to detection experts. Then, we propose multiple feature pyramids with dual fusion paths to replace the traditional single pipeline using semantic and spatial allocators. With this strategy, we can further establish deep supervision for multiple experts during training and sufficiently utilize the multiexpert detection results from leaders’ assignments during reasoning, thereby comprehensively improving the performance of the model in complex scenarios. In the experiment, we established ablation studies and performance comparisons on COCO 2017 detection and segmentation tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the model’s performance in three complex application scenarios (remote sensing, autonomous driving, and industrial fields), and the results showed our advantages."

    "abstract": "Camera-to-robot (also known as eye-to-hand) calibration is a critical component of vision-based robot manipulation. Traditional marker-based methods often require human intervention for system setup. Furthermore, existing autonomous markerless calibration methods typically rely on pre-trained robot tracking models that impede their application on edge devices and require fine-tuning for novel robot embodiments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a model-based markerless camera-to-robot calibration framework, ARC-Calib, that is fully autonomous and generalizable across diverse robots and scenarios without requiring extensive data collection or learning. First, exploratory robot motions are introduced to generate easily trackable trajectory-based visual patterns in the camera’s image frames. Then, a geometric optimization framework is proposed to exploit the coplanarity and collinearity constraints from the observed motions to iteratively refine the estimated calibration result. Our approach eliminates the need for extra effort in either environmental marker setup or data collection and model training, rendering it highly adaptable across a wide range of real-world autonomous systems. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate its robustness and generalizability."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a lightweight bidirectional cable-driven ankle exoskeleton system (total mass: 2.6 kg) based on a series elastic actuation architecture (actuator module mass: 1.05 kg). The system utilizes a waist-mounted drive unit and Bowden cables to deliver bidirectional assistance to the ankle joint (nominal force: 460 N, peak force: 680 N). By integrating a dynamically coupled adaptive oscillator (AO), the system achieves robust gait synchronization across a range of walking speeds (0.6 – 1.8 m/s, phase estimation RMSE <2.48%, stride frequency estimation RMSE <0.1 Hz). This is complemented by a Gaussian Process (GP)-based torque planner and a cascaded torque control framework, ensuring seamless coordination with natural gait. Experimental characterization of the actuator demonstrates its high dynamic performance (torque bandwidth: 12.5 Hz) and low-impedance characteristics (peak passive backdrive torque: 0.97 N · m). Human trials involving five participants show that the system significantly expands the ankle joint range of motion (up to [-15.64 °, 20.67 ° ] at high speeds) while reducing peak muscle activation levels in the tibialis anterior (18.54%–30.21%) and gastrocnemius (19.34%– 25.45%). This design, combining lightweight construction with adaptive control strategies, provides a highly effective solution for daily mobility assistance and rehabilitation applications."

    "abstract": "In the era of a fast-paced and competitive world, parents often struggle to consistently monitor their children's daily movements, particularly during their transit from home to school. Concerns about safety have grown significantly, with over 83,000 children reported missing in India in 2022, as per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Delayed reporting, lack of accurate tracking infrastructure, and limited coordination between authorities often hinder timely intervention. To address this, our work introduces a Smart Child Tracking System that employs a hybrid solution using Passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), facial recognition, and IoT technologies. The proposed system places RFID readers along a child's predefined route between home and school. Each child carries a UHF Passive RFID tag that is detected when passing these checkpoints. Once detected, our facial recognition module captures the child's face in real-time and compares it with a pre-stored image. If both the RFID tag and facial image match, the system logs the child's name, date, timestamp into database. If there is a mismatch, an immediate alert is triggered and sent to the parent and mentor via a GSM module. All system interactions are logged and visualized using an interactive dashboard built with Node.js, Express.js, and React.js, with real-time data fetched from Firebase. The architecture is inspired by modern edge computing concepts and is designed to be low-cost, scalable, energy-efficient and suitable for deployment across educational institutions and public infrastructure."

To address this, we propose a force-guided attention fusion module that adaptively adjusts the weights of visual and tactile features without human labeling. We also introduce a self-supervised future force prediction auxiliary task to reinforce the tactile modality, improve data imbalance, and encourage proper adjustment. Our method achieves an average success rate of 93% across three fine-grained, contact-rich tasks in real-world experiments. Further analysis shows that our policy appropriately adjusts attention to each modality at different manipulation stages. The videos can be viewed at https://adaptac-dex.github.io/."

This problem is modeled as a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. This study presents a methodology based on selective evolutionary strategies to determine the optimal allocation of coil loads within box annealing furnaces. A computational tool was developed using MATLAB®, featuring a graphical user interface that supports supervisory control, real-time execution, monitoring, and result visualization. The proposed approach leverages genetic algorithms, with input parameters derived from the technical specifications of real coil inventory. The optimization model integrates production cycle constraints, furnace capacity limitations, and industrial loading regulations, ensuring compliance with operational and safety standards. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the use of genetic algorithms provides an effective, robust, and practical solution for optimizing the annealing process.

However, a significant challenge lies in effectively and selectively integrating these multi-scale features to maximize overall performance. To tackle this integration challenge, we design a novel model, MambaGCN, which employs a state space model to dynamically adjust the feature weights across spatial scales during aggregation, enabling more refined feature integration while ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike transformers with their quadratic complexity, MambaGCN achieves linear complexity, substantially reducing GPU memory usage and computational cost. Moreover, we have enhanced the architectural depth by designing a density-based farthest point sampling algorithm, which allows us to selectively downsample the input data to achieve varying levels of point density. This innovation facilitates the seamless concatenation of multiple MambaGCN layers, significantly deepening the structure of the network and enhancing its ability to tackle complex point cloud tasks effectively. Through these strategic developments, MambaGCN has demonstrated outstanding performance in tasks such as point cloud classification and part segmentation, affirming its robustness and efficiency in processing point cloud data."

Heuristic approaches with naive metrics fail in complex layouts, while graph-based and learning-based methods suffer from environmental biases and limited generalization. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) as planners or agents offer a rich knowledge base, they are cost-inefficient and lack targeted historical experience. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-enhanced Object Affinities Transfer (LOAT) framework, integrating LLM-derived semantics with learning-based approaches to leverage experiential object affinities for better generalization in unseen settings. LOAT employs a dual-module strategy: one module accesses LLMs’ vast knowledge, and the other applies learned object semantic relationships, dynamically fusing these sources based on context. Evaluations in AI2-THOR and Habitat simulators show significant improvements in navigation success and efficiency, and real-world deployment demonstrates the zero-shot ability of LOAT to enhance object-goal navigation systems."

Recognition of faces remains a challenge for criminal activities due to lack of available data, domain shifts, and inability to incrementally learn without forgetting prior information, also known as catastrophic forgetting.

CONTEXT GOES HERE: FILL GAPS - with enhanced face detection capabilities using high-quality synthetic imagery (higher expression variability) enabling reduced bias against minority fringe classified criminal identities, bypassing class imbalance issues. Moreover, the continual learning component captures new information without the need for full retraining by using experience replay and parameter-regulated slow-fine tuning.

The growing prevalence of collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate LiHRA’s utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information, including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot workspaces."

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

CycleGAN outperformed large mask inpainting (LaMa) model in occlusion recovery, achieving superior pixel area ratios (PAR) (mean: 0.978 vs. 1.112) and higher intersection over union (IoU) scores (92.3% vs. 47.7% in the [0.9–1] range). This approach addresses critical limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for automated harvesting and yield monitoring with complex occlusion patterns."

    "abstract": "For scene understanding in unstructured environments, an accurate and uncertainty-aware metric-semantic mapping is required to enable informed action selection by autonomous systems. Existing mapping methods often suffer from overconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading to inconsistent map representations. In this paper, we therefore introduce EvidMTL, a multitask learning framework that uses evidential heads for depth estimation and semantic segmentation, enabling uncertainty-aware inference from monocular RGB images. To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task learning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly optimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with evidential segmentation loss. Building on this, we present EvidKimera, an uncertainty-aware semantic surface mapping framework, which uses evidential depth and semantics prediction for improved 3D metric-semantic consistency. We train and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot performance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation compared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In zero-shot mapping tests on ScanNetV2, EvidKimera outperforms Kimera by 30% in semantic surface mapping accuracy and consistency, highlighting the benefits of uncertainty-aware mapping and underscoring its potential for real-world robotic applications."

This paper introduces SkyVLN, a novel framework integrating vision-and-language navigation (VLN) with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) to enhance UAV autonomy in complex urban environments. Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language instructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic 3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal navigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history path memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial contexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The framework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance, ensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our approach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using AirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkyVLN significantly improves navigation success rates and efficiency, particularly in new and unseen environments."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition have been primarily driven by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and skeleton transformers. While conventional approaches focus on modeling joint co-occurrences through skeletal connections, they overlook the inherent positional information in 3D coordinates. Although Hyper-Graphs partially address the limitation of pairwise aggregation in capturing higher-order kinematic dependencies, challenges remain in their topological definitions. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a skeleton-to-point network (Skeleton2Point) to model joints’ position relationships directly in three-dimensional space without fixed topology limitation, which is the first to regard skeleton recognition as point clouds. However, simply considering the raw 3D coordinates would result in the loss of the anatomical identity of each keypoint and its temporal position in the sequence. To address this limitation, we augment the three-dimensional spatial coordinates with two additional dimensions: the anatomical index of each keypoint and its corresponding frame number with a proposed Information Transform Module (ITM). This transformation extends the representation from a three-dimensional to a five-dimensional feature space. Furthermore, we propose a Cluster-Dispatch-Based Interaction module (CDI) to enhance the discrimination of local-global information. In comparison with existing methods on NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120 datasets, Skeleton2Point has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on both joint modality and stream fusion. Especially, on the challenging NTU-RGB+D 120 dataset under the X-Sub and X-Set setting, the accuracies reach 90.63% and 91.92%."

    "abstract": "Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency."

Three key aspects of robot task planning present challenges yet to be resolved simultaneously, namely, (i) factorization of complex tasks specifications into simpler executable subtasks, (ii) understanding of the current task state from raw observations, and (iii) planning and verification of task executions. To address these challenges, we propose LATMOS, an automata-theory-inspired task model that, given observations from correct task executions, is able to factorize the task, while supporting verification and planning operations. LATMOS combines an observation encoder to extract features from potentially high-dimensional observations with a sequence model that encapsulates an automaton with symbols in the latent feature space. We conduct evaluations in three task model learning setups: (i) abstract tasks described by logical formulas, (ii) real-world human tasks described by videos and natural language prompts and (iii) a robot task described by image and state observations. The results show improved plan generation and verification capabilities of LATMOS across different observation modalities and tasks."

We propose Ag2x2, a computational framework for bimanual manipulation through coordination-aware visual representations that jointly encode object states and hand motion patterns while maintaining agent-agnosticism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ag2x2 achieves a 73.5% success rate across 13 diverse bimanual tasks from Bi-DexHands and PerAct<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, including challenging scenarios with deformable objects like ropes.

Furthermore, we show that representations learned through Ag2x2 can be effectively leveraged for imitation learning, establishing a scalable pipeline for skill acquisition without expert supervision. By maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks without human demonstrations or engineered rewards, Ag2x2 represents a step toward scalable learning of complex bimanual robotic skills."

However, their success rates are often not on par with expert policies, and they require fine-tuning when the setup changes. In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that bridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with behavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into compact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during RL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in simulation. While this is a key requirement for applying RL, it also yields new insights beyond existing studies on VLA performance in real-world settings. Our experimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables the RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both dense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than the RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.

However, growing environmental and safety concerns have sparked interest in alternative, eco-friendly insulating fluids. Esters have emerged as promising candidates due to their high biodegradability, flame retardance, and lower ecological impact. This paper compares two such insulating fluids-a natural ester (Envirotemp FR3) and a synthetic ester (Midel 7131)-under the influence of lightning impulse voltages, representing a critical stress condition for transformer insulation. High voltage tests, including dielectric loss factor (delta tangent) measurements, were performed before and after applying standardized impulse sequences. Results indicate that both esters maintained dielectric performance within acceptable limits, with the synthetic ester demonstrating superior stability under impulse stress. The findings confirm the technical feasibility of ester-based insulating oils as viable and sustainable alternatives to mineral oil in power transformers, supporting broader environmental and operational safety goals in modern power systems."

First, we use subject-object query pairs to predict triplets directly, eliminating the need for separate entity predictions. Additionally, the cross-attention mechanism enhances the model’s ability to query triplets. We use a single decoder to process subject and object entities simultaneously, enhancing computational speed and reducing the number of parameters. Then, we map the entities to the relational semantic space before performing relations classification, which improves the model performance by adding a small number of parameters. Finally, the set prediction loss function is designed for relation prediction to strengthen the role of relation prediction in triplets.

Due to the caregiver shortage and the patients increase, the robotic NP therapeutic system with a variable-sized suction head can be used to help the lymphedema therapy. However, the varying complexity of different limb regions can affect the accuracy of the suction path. Moreover, the moving suction path should maintain smoothness to ensure therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, finding a smooth sliding path with highly accurate suction poses on the unstructured limb surface poses a significant challenge for robotic therapy. In this paper, a smooth sliding path planning method is proposed for robotic continuous suction in limb lymphedema therapy. The easily-sealed region is identified by comparing point normals to the lip’s suction angle, simplifying path planning to a 2D plane due to lip and limb flexibility. The conjugate gradient method optimizes the path with centroid distance and smoothness constraints. Finally, after the generation of suction poses under the constraints of the lip shape, a smooth sliding path along with lip pressure commands, is obtained to regulate the robot in performing continuous suction therapy. In the experiment, the manipulator with a variable-sized head has been used to finish 10 sliding suctions from different planning path. From the result, the robot could complete 6 times sliding suctions on the phantom arm."

    "abstract": "Given the fact that visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is faced with the challenges of localization drift in the long run, we utilize drift-free Ultra-Wideband (UWB) measurements to eliminate accumulated errors in VIO. Existing UWB-VIO fusion methods are mostly constrained by the accuracy of prior UWB anchor positions. However, in large-scale localization scenarios, the precise locations of UWB anchors are difficult to obtain, and the offline calibration process is complex, significantly limiting flexibility. In this paper, we firstly design a lightweight initialization method based on a dual sliding window structure, which can rapidly obtain initial guesses for the UWB anchor coordinates. After that, we further propose a joint estimation system to refine the anchor coordinates while estimating the correction for VIO. The system combines filter-based and optimization-based methods, which mainly consists of an initialization module and a nonlinear estimator module. The filter in the initialization module provides optimization initial values and covariances, and mutually, the optimization results from the nonlinear estimator provide priors for the filter. Finally, the performance of our proposed approach is verified through both public datasets and real-world experiment. Our project, along with our dataset, has been open-sourced in the form of ROS package and ROS bag."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a multi-robot task allocation problem where a team of heterogeneous robots operates in a discrete workspace to achieve a set of tasks expressed by linear temporal logic formulas. In contrast to existing works, we further consider inter-task-time-order constraints, which are imposed on the start or end times of each task. Solving such problems generally requires combinatorial search, which is not scalable. Inspired by the efficiency of max-plus algebra in handling time constraints, we propose a novel approach called MaxAuc, which integrates Auction-based task allocation with Max-plus algebra in a novel manner. Specifically, max-plus computations are performed to approximate task priorities in the auction without explicitly solving the constraint optimization problem. Our numerical results demonstrate that MaxAuc is highly scalable with respect to both the number of robots and the number of tasks, while maintaining a tolerable performance trade-off compared to the baseline’s optimal yet exhaustive solution."

    "abstract": "Power amplifiers (PAs) exhibit an intrinsic nonlinear behavior that can hinder their application to highpower radio frequency transmission. Such characteristic of PAs produces severe output signal distortion when the input signal achieves a certain amplitude, thereby limiting their efficiency to maintain a linear behavior. This problem becomes critical with modern technologies, such as 5 G or 6 G, which employ wide-bandwidth signals, thus implying drastic spectral regrowth phenomena and intermodulation distortion (IMD). In practical terms, the PA spectral efficiency is degraded and the input information becomes corrupted. This paper proposes a control system design based on reference tracking to address this problem. The input-output mapping of a PA is modeled through a state-space representation derived from a classical Volterra series. Then we employ fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) representation to exactly describe the nonlinear behavior of the PA in terms of a convex combination of linear local models. This approach enables the design of a fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and considering the minimization of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$</tex> norm between the input reference and the PA output. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique is able to mitigate the open-loop PA distortion effects, as evidenced by the attenuation of IMD components, especially within the input signal bandwidth."

    "abstract": "Using 3D point clouds in odometry estimation in robotics often requires finding a set of correspondences between points in subsequent scans. While there are established methods for point clouds of sufficient quality, state-of-the-art still struggles when this quality drops. Thus, this paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting robust point correspondences between pairs of noisy, sparse and unstructured 3D point clouds from a light-weight, low-power, inexpensive, consumer-grade System-on-Chip (SoC) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor. Our network is based on the transformer architecture which allows leveraging the attention mechanism to discover pairs of points in consecutive scans with the greatest mutual affinity. The proposed network is trained in a self-supervised way using set-based multi-label classification cross-entropy loss, where the ground-truth set of matches is found by solving the Linear Sum Assignment (LSA) optimization problem, which avoids tedious hand annotation of the training data. Additionally, posing the loss calculation as multi-label classification permits supervising on point correspondences directly instead of on odometry error, which is not feasible for sparse and noisy data from the SoC radar we use. We evaluate our method with an open-source state-of-the-art Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) framework in real-world Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights and with the widely used public Coloradar dataset. Evaluation shows that the proposed method improves the position estimation accuracy by over 14 % and 19 % on average, respectively.

Traditional VTT locomotion depends on discrete reference transitions, resulting in pauses, slow progress, and unintended ground impacts. Inertia-driven rotation at each step also generates impact forces on joints, raising durability concerns. CIM rolling continuously adjusts joint lengths by tracking the center of gravity in real time, enabling smoother motion and minimizing impacts. This approach allows VTTs to move directly to targets without unnecessary resets. Simulations validate the effectiveness of CIM rolling, demonstrating a 50% increase in speed and a 49% reduction in nodal impact force compared to conventional methods."

While purely geometric maps using voxel grids allow for general navigation, obtaining up-to-date spatial and semantically rich representations that scale to dynamic large-scale environments remains challenging. In this work, we present CURB-OSG, an open-vocabulary dynamic 3D scene graph engine that generates hierarchical decompositions of urban driving scenes via multi-agent collaboration. By fusing the camera and LiDAR observations from multiple perceiving agents with unknown initial poses, our approach generates more accurate maps compared to a single agent while constructing a unified open-vocabulary semantic hierarchy of the scene. Unlike previous methods that rely on ground truth agent poses or are evaluated purely in simulation, CURB-OSG alleviates these constraints. We evaluate the capabilities of CURB-OSG on real-world multi-agent sensor data obtained from multiple sessions of the Oxford Radar RobotCar dataset. We demonstrate improved mapping and object prediction accuracy through multi-agent collaboration as well as evaluate the environment partitioning capabilities of the proposed approach.

The method is designed for localization solutions where UWB modules act as supplementary sensors. Our approach enables the automatic detection and calibration of previously unknown anchors during operation, removing the need for manual setup. By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that our metric which triggers an initialization decision is more conservative than current ones commonly based on initial linear or non-linear initialization guesses. This allows for better initialization geometry and subsequently lower initialization errors. We demonstrate the proposed approach on two different mobile robots: an autonomous forklift and a quadcopter equipped with a UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) framework.

This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor."

Programmable actuation control enables localized strain gradients within the microfluidic platform, achieving differential mechanical regimes for functional modulation of integrated muscle constructs. The system implements mechanical conditioning to recapitulate exercise-induced myocyte damage and subsequent regenerative processes through controlled deformation protocols. Our radial-strain actuators generate 19.4% maximum principal strain, while axial-strain configurations achieve 8.3% baseline deformation. Dynamic input modulation enables precise strain reduction to 7.4% and 2.2%, respectively establishing differential mechanical regimes for simulating exercise-associated functional impairment (high-strain phase) and recovery processes (low-strain phase). This strain-programmable platform establishes a robust framework for investigating mechanobiological thresholds in functional muscle regeneration."

Random Forest classifier yielded the most accurate results with an accuracy of 93.60 percent, AUC score of 98.27 percent, and F1-score of 90.04 percent. True conclusions may be drawn with regard to feature importance analysis, with network traffic anomalies (r=0.6426) and failed login attempts (r=0.4501) proving to be the strongest factors to calculate the vulnerability of a particular device. The second significant security factors that were ascertained after this analysis are the age of a device, the level of its encryption, and its level of authentication. The implementation of machine learning to detect proactive vulnerabilities in medical devices is possible and the paper records a precision of 89.30% accuracy.

It integrates two key mechanisms: a look-back window that uses recent vehicle behavior to optimize the model used in a look-ahead stage for trajectory optimization and control. The optimized model and its associated parameters are then incorporated into an adaptive path planner to optimize reference racing paths in real time. Experiments across diverse racing scenarios demonstrate that LLA-MPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptation speed and handling, even during sudden friction transitions.

The propulsion model of the corkscrew generating the traveling wave is derived, and a temporal-spatial decomposition method is applied to validate the high efficiency of traveling wave generation. The trade-off between wave amplitude and suction cup depth is investigated to determine an optimized configuration. The results show that the robot’s speed aligns well with the propulsion model. The traveling wave ratio calculated from experiments is 0.938. The optimized configuration consists of a corkscrew with a 14 mm diameter and suction cups with a 2.5 mm depth, achieving a crawling speed of 3.02 ± 0.28 mm/s while moving upside down. The combination of the proposed smooth traveling wave generation method and distributed suction cups enables the robot to crawl upside down while carrying a 200 g load and to climb a vertical wall, like a natural snail."

Many of the processes often require an observer to get the proper estimation of states. Most observers of bilinear systems in the literature have static gain parameters, which are quite restrictive. In this paper, a dynamic bilinear observer design methodology is presented. The main objective is to use a dynamic observer system to replace the observer’s static gain. An augmented system involving the compensator’s state and error signal is developed. The augmented system is used to design the dynamic observer’s state transition matrix and the constant gain matrices. The proposed design method uses the Lyapunov stability approach and casts the design problem into a semi-definite programming problem. Linear matrix inequality (LMI) tools are used to reduce the number of semi-definite positive variables involved in the optimization process. Proper conditions are applied to keep the stability property of the observer’s error dynamics apart from the input. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic bilinear observer."

Furthermore, we introduce a novel composite deception-oriented reward function, which combines hitting rewards, belief switch rewards, and position advantage rewards to facilitate the training of deceptive behaviors. Simulation results across varying numbers of robots demonstrate that incorporating deception significantly increases the success rate of Attackers, with an average improvement of over 70% compared to non-deceptive strategies. Additionally, real-world experiments with omnidirectional mobile robots further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study establishes a generalizable framework for modeling deception in multi-agent systems, with potential applications in various multi-agent scenarios."

    "abstract": "Lizards are capable of climbing stably on various terrains. Their tails are key to this ability. The lizard uses its flexible tail with graded stiffness as a fifth limb and climbing aid. The tail also enables soft landings, preventing injury from falls. Inspired by this, tails have been incorporated into many climbing robots to enhance their mobility, mimicking lizards. These robotic tails are generally classified as either rigid (stiff) or flexible (soft). A rigid tail can provide a large preload for pitch-back prevention but has a limited contact area for surface adhesion to avoid sliding backward on slopes. In contrast, a flexible tail conforms to the terrain’s contours, increasing the contact area and thereby improving surface adhesion. However, it provides limited preload. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel hybrid rigid-flexible robotic tail (HIFLEX) that achieves a balanced combination of preload and contact area. The tail structure design features double-sided inclined ribs and is divided into three modular segments (base, middle, and tip), with graded stiffness decreasing progressively from the base to the tip. The asymmetric (inclined) ribbed structure allows the tail to generate anisotropic friction, resulting in high adhesion (tail-to-surface attachment) to prevent backward sliding and low friction (tail-to-surface release) to facilitate upward climbing. The proposed tail is attached to a climbing robot via an actuator capable of pressing the tail downward to generate sufficient preload. The experimental results demonstrate that this unique tail enhances the robot’s climbing performance on rough and deformable slopes while preventing damage to the robot during falls."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of safe visual servoing control of manipulators using an uncalibrated eye-in-hand camera based on control barrier functions (CBFs). Traditional CBFs are defined in the workspace, corresponding to the global coordinates of the base frame. However, when the camera’s position or orientation is adjusted for a better field of view, it becomes uncalibrated, making it challenging to obtain the precise positions of the robot and obstacles using onboard sensors like a camera. To address this, we propose a novel visual servoing control barrier function (VS-CBF) for manipulators, which depends only on the image and depth data sensed by an RGB-D camera. Given an uncalibrated camera, we develop an adaptive estimator for the unknown camera parameters. Based on this estimator, we also design a kinematic visual servoing control law as a nominal controller, ensuring the convergence of the robotic system. The safe controller is then obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem that incorporates the designed VS-CBF and the nominal controller. Finally, experimental results conducted on a UR3 manipulator are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "We present a novel machine learning framework and synthetic dataset for performing absolute localization on planetary surfaces where satellite navigation systems are unavailable. Current approaches involve manual surface-to-satellite image matching by human rover operators, limiting the rate of planetary exploration and scientific utilization. Our framework leverages deep neural networks to perform image similarity matching between a rover’s onboard cameras and corresponding ground-view images from a digital twin environment created from satellite and elevation maps. The rover views, satellite, and elevation maps are taken from a photorealistic lunar environment simulated in a 3D graphics engine (Unreal Engine 4). The synthetic twin ground-view re-projections are generated using an open-source 3D graphics software (Blender). In total, we generate a dataset of 1.68 million images at 210,000 locations. The images and corresponding metadata are then used to train a DINOv2 vision transformer image similarity model through supervised fine-tuning to determine matching locations between the rover views and candidate re-projections. Through this method, our model is able to determine the ground truth location within 5 m using just 2.5% of the search space, outperforming other deep learning and classical image comparison benchmarks."

    "abstract": "To avoid dangerous situations, such as collisions in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles must predict the risks of the current scene to take safe actions. Traditional rule-based risk prediction methods and existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which typically rely on manually designed driving decision rules or heuristic reward functions, often fail to capture the complexity of real-world dangerous scenarios, leading to suboptimal and unsafe driving decisions. To address this limitation, we develop a novel RL method, called Group Opinion Risk-Aware Reinforcement Learning (GORA-RL), for safer driving decisions that align with real-world conditions. Specifically, we first introduce surveys of human drivers to assess risk in real-world driving situations. Using these real group opinions as training data, we train a risk prediction model, referred to as the risk prediction model with a Transformer (RPT), that captures the crucial characteristics of these scenarios, resulting in more realistic and reliable risk predictions. This model is then integrated as a reward function to train an RL algorithm for making driving decisions in various scenarios. The experiments validate that our approach outperforms two state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in challenging congested scenarios, such as merging and intersections, in terms of reward and several other metrics.

    "abstract": "Behaviour trees (BTs) are popular within robotics due to their reactivity, reusability, and modularity. BTs are often designed by hand using expert domain knowledge. However, robot environments contain sources of uncertainty which affect robot behaviour. It is challenging for human designers to reason over the effects of uncertainty up to the task horizon, limiting robot performance. For example, the chance of an unexpected blockage late along a robot’s route should encourage the robot to take an alternate path. Therefore, in this paper we refine the task-level behaviour encoded in a BT through planning under uncertainty. The refinement process modifies when action nodes are executed by reasoning over the effects of uncertainty, improving task performance. We first extract a state space from the BT and learn a set of Bayesian networks (BNs) which model the stochastic dynamics of robot actions. We then use the extracted state space and BNs to construct and solve a Markov decision process which captures robot execution. This produces a policy which describes the refined behaviour. We empirically demonstrate how our approach reduces the completion time for robot navigation and search tasks."

A real case study in a University Hospital is presented, focusing on the scheduling and communication of consultations and imaging exams. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is used to map workflows, and TOC's Five Focusing Steps are applied to guide improvements. The analysis reveals recurrent problems, including the absence of clinical prioritization, ineffective patient communication, and technological limitations. The findings demonstrate TOC's potential as a practical and scalable management tool capable of delivering rapid and sustainable efficiency gains.

    "abstract": "Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture, incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system. Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture."

For this reason, stability concerns remain a key issue in the literature whenever new control schemes for pHRI applications are proposed. Due to the nonlinear nature of robots, stability analyses generally rely on passivity concepts and consider ideal models of robot manipulators. Therefore, the first objective of this paper is to conduct a detailed analysis of the sources of instability in proxy-based constrained admittance controllers for pHRI applications, taking into account parasitic effects such as transmission elasticity, motor velocity saturation, and actuation delay. The second objective of this paper is to perform a sensitivity analysis, supported by experimental results, to identify how the control parameters affect the stability of the overall system. Finally, the third objective is to propose an adaptation technique for the proxy parameters, with the goal of maximizing transparency in pHRI. The proposed adaptation method is validated through simulations and experimental tests."

The geometry of each taper panel is established to provide necessary parameters such as protrusion distance, taper angle, and crease thickness required for 3D modeling and FEA analysis. Simulations and experiments show that by optimizing these parameters, our design can achieve a tunable constant force output. Moreover, the origami-inspired soft gripper dynamically adapts to different shapes while preventing excessive forces, with potential applications in logistics, manufacturing, and other industrial settings that require stable and adaptive operations."

    "abstract": "To avoid being traced, threat actors frequently exploit anonymity-enhancing technologies, such as VPNs, to obscure their digital identity. This study presents an innovative framework for the real-time identification of secure web traffic transmitted via VPNs, with a specific focus on the HTTPS and QUIC (HTTP/3) protocols. When accessing a web server through a VPN, two round-trip times (RTTs) are defined from the server’s perspective: one between the web server and the VPN, and another encompassing the entire path from the server to the VPN and then to the client. The proposed detection framework leverages inconsistencies in packet RTTs and employs active probing techniques targeting VPN servers from the web server. In regions with stringent internet controls, obfuscated VPNs enable users to bypass censorship without revealing their VPN usage. This obfuscation is often achieved by routing VPN traffic through proxy servers that reshape it to resemble standard HTTPS flows. Our framework can detect traffic under such obfuscation strategies. By applying machine learning to analyze RTT patterns, the system can effectively identify intrusions that involve VPN-based anonymity. This research lays the groundwork for developing robust and adaptive VPN detection systems, which are essential for safeguarding the integrity and privacy of digital infrastructure."

The research shows that: 1) The increase of the default rate of downstream enterprises has damaged the competitive stability of upstream oligopoly enterprises, and affected the profits of upstream oligopoly enterprises, which is not conducive to the development of the whole market. Therefore, upstream oligopoly enterprises should also do a good job in risk assessment and early warning to avoid the default of downstream enterprises and strengthen the stability of enterprise output while ensuring their own development .2) The lower expected loss rate makes banks more willing to provide funds to oligopolistic enterprises, and oligopolistic enterprises have sufficient funds to maintain stable and balanced output and maintain their competitive position. The higher expected loss rate will make banks more cautious, and it is difficult for oligopolistic enterprises to borrow money from banks. The decrease of cash flow makes oligopolistic enterprises in trouble and difficult to maintain their competitive position. In order to maintain operation and cash flow, oligopolistic enterprises will take more radical cost control measures, including reducing prices to increase sales, so as to try to increase cash flow in the short term. This behavior leads to the intensification of market competition."

Based on survey data, three distinct conflict perception profiles were identified: low exposure–protected, moderate intensity–constructive, and high frequency–unresolved. Random forest analysis revealed that parental conflict frequency, intensity, and resolution, along with adolescents’ negative coping strategies, were the most important predictors of EPB, while bullying-related factors had a weaker yet notable effect. Further subgroup analyses using random forest regression demonstrated that adolescents from low-care or single-parent families showed a stronger link between bullying experiences and EPB, whereas those from high-care and intact families exhibited greater resilience. These findings highlight the central role of family dynamics in shaping adolescent behavior and demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering complex interaction mechanisms."

A vocabulary learning pathway was created based on the four motivational dimensions of the ARCS model—Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. By utilizing the Coze agent's ability to create authentic learning environments and provide personalized feedback, the study designed a closed-loop, adaptive instructional approach. A six-week experimental study conducted at T Middle School found that students using the agent-supported learning pathway showed significant improvements in vocabulary performance and motivation compared to those using traditional methods. The results confirm the potential of LLM-driven intelligent agents in fostering sustained motivation, enhancing vocabulary transfer, and enriching the overall learning experience.

    "abstract": "To address the power budget limitations inherent in passive radar systems utilizing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals, this paper introduces a dimensionality-reduced generalized likelihood ratio function (DR-GLRF) framework for simultaneous target detection and spatial localization. Delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) are generated in the frequency domain, collapsed into one-dimensional delay profiles, and transformed into the spatial domain through proposed method. Spatial diversity gains are achieved by fusing data across multiple satellites, yielding a sequence of spatially resolved DR-GLRF frames. Target motion between consecutive frames is tracked using a dynamic programming algorithm (DPA), mitigating the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints of GNSS-based detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a maximum detection range of 5,794.61 m, representing a 230.34% improvement over the 1,754.12 m range of conventional approaches. Experiments employing BeiDou B3I signals confirm enhanced detection performance, reduced susceptibility to bistatic radar cross-section (RCS) scintillation, and superior positioning accuracy compared to traditional methods. Notably, the DR-GLRF approach exhibits a lower detection threshold significance level than DDM-based alternatives, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.00 m for aerial targets—77.82% lower than the 27.05 m RMSE of time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithms. Critically, the proposed framework enables reliable detection and localization even when traditional methods fail to resolve faint target echoes."

Fed-KD leverages knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from complex teacher networks to simpler student models in order to reduce communication overhead in bandwidth-constrained environments. Fed-TKD improves communication efficiency further by applying tensor decomposition to reduce parameter redundancy. Experimental results using an industrial IoT radar imagery dataset show that both methods can significantly reduce communication costs while maintaining a high model accuracy, making them especially suitable for privacy-preserving industrial IoT sensing applications. Furthermore, experimental results with both IID and non-IID data distributions confirm the robustness of the proposed methods in heterogeneous environments."

    "abstract": "Medical microwave imaging (MMWI) prototypes have demonstrated potential in various clinical applications. For successful clinical translation, these systems must be reliable and yield consistent results, that is, they must demonstrate high repeatability. This systematic review critically appraises the existing literature on repeatability in MMWI, with particular attention to the protocols, metrics, and outcomes reported. A systematic search of Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PubMed was conducted on April 29th 2025, identifying 21 studies that quantitatively evaluated repeatability in MMWI. Two reviewers independently performed full-text screening and data extraction, with disagreements resolved through consultation with a third reviewer. Descriptive analyses were performed using tables and figures to characterise study design, methodologies, and findings. Considerable heterogeneity was observed in sample size, imaging protocols, and the selection of repeatability metrics. Almost all studies were restricted to breast imaging applications. Frequently reported sources of variability included subject repositioning, tissue changes, and hardware-related factors. Although most studies reported acceptable repeatability, the absence of standardised protocols and metrics limits cross-study comparison and the establishment of benchmarks. The review concludes with recommendations to harmonise approaches that contribute to accelerate the clinical translation of MMWI systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, anti-resonant hollow-core fibers (AR-HCFs) have made remarkable progress, surpassing the loss limit of conventional silica solid-core fibers, and achieving attenuation below 0.1 dB/km. Due to their ultra-low latency, negligible nonlinearity, and broad transmission bandwidth, AR HCFs have attracted significant attention from both academia and industry, positioning them as a foundational technology for optical communications over the next half-century. However, large-scale industrial production of AR-HCFs remains underdeveloped, and prior research has been largely confined to laboratory-scale experiments using short fiber segments, failing to fully explore their performance potential or identify deployment-related challenges. To address this gap, we present the field deployments of four structurally distinct AR-HCF cables spanning 10∼42.7 km. Post-deployment measurements demonstrate an average link loss reduction from 0.599 dB/km to 0.113 dB/km, with the lowest recorded span loss reaching 0.065 dB/km, scoring the world's first fiber cable deployment to break the 0.1 dB/km. Leveraging these deployed links, we conduct real-time coherent transmission experiments at 800 Gb/s to 1.2 Tb/s across S-, C-, and L-bands, validating the feasibility of co-time co-frequency full-duplex (CCFD) transmission in hollow-core fibers and characterizing the impact of gas absorption (e.g., CO₂ and H₂O) on system performance. Despite these impairments, we achieve the first field demonstration of real-time terabit-scale coherent transmission over the S+C+L band, delivering a record aggregate capacity of 114.9 Tb/s over 137.36 km using 105 channels."

    "abstract": "The increasing presence of non-linear loads in electrical power systems (EPS) has driven extensive research into mitigating the associated problems, particularly the presence of harmonic content. This phenomenon can cause undesirable effects in EPS and shorten the useful life of electrical equipment. One effective solution to reduce harmonic distortion is the strategic allocation of Active Power Filters (APFs), which use DC-AC converters to produce alternating voltage or current with desirable waveforms. Optimally placing these devices, in order to achieve better technical and economic performance, represents a complex optimization challenge, as it involves solving a nonlinear, multi-modal problem. Various techniques can be employed to address this issue, including metaheuristic approaches. Among them, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stands out due to its effectiveness and ease of implementation. This paper presents a methodology for the optimal allocation of APFs in electrical distribution systems using PSO, with the objective of minimizing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current signals. The proposed methodology has been implemented computationally, and OpenDSS has been used to perform the harmonic analysis. The IEEE 13-Bus Feeder system serves as the test case for evaluating the proposed method."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a robot active task cognition framework for Situation-Aware Task Planning (SATP), leveraging visual scene understanding to generate action sequences. By integrating object knowledge, user preferences, and Large Language Models (LLMs), SATP interprets the robot’s current visual perception, and creates procedural actions that align with what the robot “sees”. Diverging from conventional methods requiring explicit verbal commands, our SATP framework autonomously performs task cognition, actively formulating robot-executable action sequences directly from visual input. Initially, a novel approach for describing the visual scene is presented, enabling the robot to grasp detailed object-level properties and inter-object relationships based on its observations. Building on this, a knowledge base for active task cognition is constructed using ontology technology. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage dual-feedback task planner, ReProg+, powered by LLMs, specifically designed for situation-aware task planning grounded in visual data. The efficacy, reliability, and advantages of our solution are thoroughly validated in real-world visual scenarios. Additionally, SATP has been tested with a real robot, with results confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "With the growing need to ensure data freshness in time-sensitive applications, the Age of Information (AoI) has become a critical performance metric, particularly in IEEE 802.15.6 time-slotted wireless systems. In these systems, each data sample carries significant informational value, making it critical to maintain the freshness of all collected samples without loss. However, limited time and bandwidth resources pose a significant challenge, underscoring the importance of maximizing resource utilization. To address this issue, we propose an on-demand burst transmission mechanism that combines buffer-aware scheduling with block-based data transmission. This hybrid approach eliminates idle slots and reduces acknowledgment overhead, thereby improving slot efficiency and significantly lowering the AoI of all sampled data under tight resource constraints. To further enhance the robustness of on-demand burst transmissions in lossy wireless environments, we incorporate predictive channel awareness into the burst scheduling process, enabling adaptive and reliable transmission decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms conventional AoI schedulers, especially in resource-constrained and dynamically varying network conditions."

In this work, we introduce a unified, learning-based loco-manipulation framework for quadrupedal robots, allowing them to utilize the external environment as support to extend their workspace and enhance their manipulation capabilities. Specifically, our method proposes a unified policy that takes limited onboard sensors and proprioception as input, generating whole-body actions that enable the robot to manipulate objects. To guide the policy learning for environment-in-the-loop manipulation, we design a set of rewards that address challenges such as imprecise perception and center-of-mass shifts. Additionally, we employ curriculum learning to train both teacher and student policies, ensuring effective skill transfer in complex tasks. We train the policy in simulation and conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating that our approach allows robots to manipulate previously inaccessible objects, opening up new possibilities for enhancing quadrupedal robot capabilities without the need for hardware modifications or additional costs.

This work proposes an approach to SoC estimation by combining machine learning (ML) models - long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) - with statistical replication using the maximum entropy bootstrap (MEB), followed by post-processing with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The precision of the proposed model was confirmed using experimental data collected from the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) battery group, conducted on the A123 battery cell under three dynamic profiles: DST, US06, and FUDS. Results demonstrate that the LSTM model achieved the best performance, with approximately 77 % lower mean absolute error compared to SVR and 69 % lower than RF on the DST profile, and also excelled on the US06 profile, while SVR performed better for the FUDS profile."

This paper presents a novel method for generating sarcasm that employs advanced techniques such as text enhancement, transfer learning, along with assessment strategies. Our technique begins with pretraining a Transformer-based T5 model on a large dataset of sardonic and non-sarcastic texts. The model is then fine-tuned with an updated dataset produced by Recurrent Generational Adversarial Networks (RGAN). We improve the generation process by using sampling approaches to encourage a variety of outputs, and we evaluate the model's effectiveness with sarcasm detection systems.

We integrate the regular Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a novel pose optimization mechanism to more efficiently mitigate disturbances (such as human behavioral uncertainties or robot actuation noise) during the task. The core of our methodology involves a two-step iterative design: At each planning horizon, we determine the optimal pose of the robotic arm (joint angle configuration) from a candidate set, aiming to achieve the lowest estimated control cost. This selection is based on solving a disturbance-aware Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE), which also determines the optimal inputs for the robot’s whole body control (including both the mobile base and the robotic arm). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide theoretical derivation for the disturbance-aware DARE and perform simulated experiments and hardware demos using a Fetch robot under varying conditions, including different trajectories and different levels of disturbances. The results reveal that our proposed approach outperforms baseline algorithms."

    "abstract": "Resection of pathological tissue is a common procedure in surgical oncology for treating tumors. In robot-assisted electrosurgery, the use of predefined markers to guide autonomous robotic resection is gaining traction. Accurate tracking of these markers and minimizing electrocautery damage are critical for the safe and effective autonomous resection of tumors. This paper introduces a safety enhanced autonomous resection method for laparoscopic surgery, designed to mitigate the risks posed by tissue deformation during the resection process. Initially, we pre-plan the cutting path and design a switching strategy for navigation waypoints based on a preview tracking mechanism. Then, we develop a depth-fused navigation controller and a safe withdrawal motion controller. Next, an inertial tracking mechanism is established to evaluate tissue deformation over short periods. Finally, we develop a confidence generator to fuse the two controllers, ensuring that tissue deformation during the resection process does not cause additional electrocautery damage. Simulation and phantom experiments were conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. This work represents a significant step toward achieving autonomous robotic resection."

    "abstract": "Behavior cloning (BC) has become a staple imitation learning paradigm in robotics due to its ease of teaching robots complex skills directly from expert demonstrations. However, BC suffers from an inherent generalization issue. To solve this, the status quo solution is to gather more data. Yet, regardless of how much training data is available, out-of-distribution performance is still sub-par, lacks any formal guarantee of convergence and success, and is incapable of allowing and recovering from physical interactions with humans. These are critical flaws when robots are deployed in ever-changing human-centric environments. Thus, we propose Elastic Motion Policy (EMP), a one-shot imitation learning framework that allows robots to adjust their behavior based on the scene change while respecting the task specification. Trained from a single demonstration, EMP follows the dynamical systems paradigm where motion planning and control are governed by first-order differential equations with convergence guarantees. We leverage Laplacian editing in full end-effector space, ℝ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> ×SO(3), and online convex learning of Lyapunov functions, to adapt EMP online to new contexts, avoiding the need to collect new demonstrations. We extensively validate our framework in real robot experiments, demonstrating its robust and efficient performance in dynamic environments, with obstacle avoidance and multi-step task capabilities. https://elastic-motion-policy.github.io/EMP/"

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for robotic navigation, allowing robots to learn through trial and error. However, real-world robotic tasks often suffer from sparse rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal policies due to sample inefficiency of RL. In this work, we introduce Confidence-Controlled Exploration (CCE), a novel method that improves sample efficiency in RL-based robotic navigation without modifying the reward function. Unlike existing approaches, such as entropy regularization and reward shaping, which can introduce instability by altering rewards, CCE dynamically adjusts trajectory length based on policy entropy. Specifically, it shortens trajectories when uncertainty is high to enhance exploration and extends them when confidence is high to prioritize exploitation. CCE is a principled and practical solution inspired by a theoretical connection between policy entropy and gradient estimation. It integrates seamlessly with on-policy and off-policy RL methods and requires minimal modifications. We validate CCE across REINFORCE, PPO, and SAC in both simulated and real-world navigation tasks. CCE outperforms fixed-trajectory and entropy-regularized baselines, achieving an 18% higher success rate, 20-38% shorter paths, and 9.32% lower elevation costs under a fixed training sample budget. Finally, we deploy CCE on a Clearpath Husky robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex outdoor environments."

The proposed TFL combines time-domain reconstruction fidelity with frequency-domain spectral preservation, addressing the limitations of purely temporal loss functions that may fail to maintain physiologically critical spectral characteristics. Applying the mechanism on baseline models (1D U-Net, EEGDnet, fullyconnected neural networks, and LSTM architectures) indicates that the proposed approach leads to superior spectral preservation, highlighting TFL’s efficacy in EEG denoising tasks."

    "abstract": "Cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) in monocular 3D object detection transfers LiDAR’s accurate depth information to compensate for the limitations of camera model. However, current methods directly align the intermediate features of the teacher and student networks, in which the modality gap between LiDAR and camera hinders their effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, we design two modules, namely, Consistent Alignment Module (CAM) and Deformable Adapter Module (DAM) to reduce the modality gap of CMKD. The CAM transforms intermediate features of LiDAR and camera into some consistent features through a lightweight Target Head. It is based on the observation that some high-level features such as heatmaps and depths are highly correlated in CMKD, though modality gap appears between LiDAR and camera. Therefore, these features can be effectively transferred from teacher to student in CMKD. The DAM introduces a deformable adapter for the intermediate features of the student network to reduce background noise in CMKD. This helps to dynamically align its intermediate features with the teacher network. We then propose a Consistent Feature Alignment network (MonoCFA) for CMKD to boost monocular 3D object detection. Our network integrates the two designed modules at different levels of the teacher and student networks, in order to align the intermediate features of LiDAR and camera more accurately and reliably. Our model can be widely applied to existing monocular 3D object detection models. For validation, we choose the representative MonoDLE, GUPNet, and DID-M3D as base models. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method significantly outperforms the three base models by 39%, 15.5%, and 15%, respectively, and achieves state-of-the-art when compared to other CMKD models."

Most existing targetless calibration methods cannot apply to ground vehicles with the LiDAR-IMU-camera combination system. To address this issue, in this paper we propose GLIC-Calib: a carefully designed targetless and one-shot spatial-temporal calibration method of LiDAR-IMU-camera for ground vehicles. First, we recover the real-time camera scale by constant camera height and visual ground points. Then we initialize 6-DoF extrinsic of LiDAR-IMU and camera-IMU as well as their time offsets by raw motion measurements and ground constraints. Finally we refine spatial-temporal parameters of LiDAR-IMU and camera-IMU by high accurate LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameter obtained from environmental association. Experiments conducted on the self-collected datasets with different sensor configurations show the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods compared with others.

Our work is based on FruitNeRF [6], which employs a neural semantic field combined with a fruit-specific clustering approach. The requirement for adaptation for each fruit type limits the applicability of the method, and makes it difficult to use in practice. To lift this limitation, we design a shape-agnostic multi-fruit counting framework, that complements the RGB and semantic data with instance masks predicted by a vision foundation model. The masks are used to encode the identity of each fruit as instance embeddings into a neural instance field. By volumetrically sampling the neural fields, we extract a point cloud embedded with the instance features, which can be clustered in a fruit-agnostic manner to obtain the fruit count. We evaluate our approach using a synthetic dataset containing apples, plums, lemons, pears, peaches, and mangoes, as well as a real-world benchmark apple dataset. Our results demonstrate that FruitNeRF++ is easier to control and compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods."

This study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot’s electrical power profile. Our approach diverges from conventional CPU-based evaluations and instead leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization coefficient (f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">U</inf>), the energy conversion metric (f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</inf>), and the reliability coefficient (f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</inf>), to capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution. Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric (α) provides further insight into long-term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment-centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and cost reduction."

However, most existing works on CBF synthesis focus on fully known settings. Synthesizing CBFs online based on perception data in unknown environments poses particular challenges. Specifically, this requires the construction of CBFs from high-dimensional data efficiently in real time. This paper proposes a new approach for online synthesis of CBFs directly from local Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). Inspired by steady-state thermal fields, we show that the smoothness requirement of CBFs corresponds to the solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation with suitably chosen boundary conditions. By leveraging the sparsity of the coefficient matrix in Laplace’s equation, our approach allows for efficient computation of safety values for each grid cell in the map. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the results show that our CBFs can be synthesized in an average of milliseconds on a 200×200 grid map, highlighting its real-time applicability."

In addition, we present a novel, efficient, and cost-free data generation method specifically designed for dual-arm cooperative tasks, overcoming the lack of sufficient training data. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our approach improves the success rate by 26.3% compared to existing planning methods and by 54.7% compared to end-to-end methods.

However, this type of perception still relies on LiDAR data to construct ground truth databases, a process that is both cumbersome and time-consuming. Additionally, most mass-produced autonomous driving systems are equipped solely with surround camera sensors and lack the LiDAR data necessary for precise annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fine-tuning method for BEV perception network based on visual 2D semantic perception, aimed at enhancing the model’s generalization capabilities in new scene data. Leveraging the maturity of 2D perception technologies, our method utilizes only 2D semantic segmentation labels and monocular depth estimations, thereby significantly reducing the dependence on expensive BEV ground truths and offering strong potential for industrial deployment. Extensive experiments and comparative analyses on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, it improves mAP and NDS by 2.51% and 1.93% on nuScenes, and by 1.21% and 0.78% on Waymo, respectively, validating its practical utility and robustness across diverse domains."

This study introduces a new electromagnetically modulated resistance mechanism to achieve compact and efficient passive force feedback in wearable devices. The proposed system employs two electromagnets to dynamically modulate tendon tension, generating resistance forces for the fingers. This approach enables passive force feedback without bulky mechanisms, complex actuation, or intricate control strategies. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, we developed a kinesthetic wearable device for the index finger and thumb. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the device achieved a peak tendon locking force of 5.8N with a current of 0.1A at 9V. A user study with nine participants assessed stiffness discrimination using resistive force feedback in three tasks: index finger only, thumb only, and pinch action. The study yielded accuracy rates of 75%, 66%, and 69%, respectively.

While machine learning models have been increasingly used to predict the kinematics of CTRs, there is a lack of an established framework for evaluating generative inverse kinematic models, which are able to solve the inverse kinematic problem by providing various joint solutions for a desired end position. In this study, we introduce a workspace-based measure to assess the diversity of solutions produced by three generative models: an invertible neural network (INN), a conditional invertible neural network (cINN), and a conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE). We find that all three models record similar end position errors (3-6 mm) on dexterous subsets of the workspace, but that a cINN outperforms the others in generating diverse solutions using a workspace-based 1-Wasserstein distance by at least 2.38 standard deviations. To further test the applicability of these models, we integrate the best-performing cINN into a CTR controller and demonstrate the first use of a generative CTR model with real-time teleoperation under task-based constraints."

A joint optimization framework, which simultaneously considers the UAV trajectory, antenna position, transmit radar and communication beamforming, is developed. The objective is to maximize the achievable communication data rate, subject to the constraints on the UAV mobility, radar beampattern gain and power budget. To efficiently solve the resulting non-convex problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) scheme is used to optimize the antenna positions, while beamforming and trajectory variables are updated via a successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design achieves significant performance improvements over conventional UAVDFRC systems with fixed antenna arrays (FPA)."

    "abstract": "We present a low-cost, soft tactile sensor using common, easily sourced materials that can be integrated with existing robotic gripper systems without requiring complex fabrication techniques or expensive components. Our approach includes two designs: a flexible linear sensor constructed from a rubber tube and a planar sensor made with a rubber membrane stretched over an enclosure. Both sensors contain an embedded speaker and microphones that leverage active acoustic sensing to map the unique acoustic resonant response of the cavity’s structure to deformations that occur when the robotic gripper is grasping an object. Experimental results demonstrate that, using a support vector machine, the linear sensor achieves contact point estimation with an RMSE of 6 mm, while the planar sensor achieves an RMSE of 0.57–0.62 mm. Additionally, the planar sensor classifies six objects with an accuracy of 97.7%. These results demonstrate the potential for active acoustics to be an accessible method for enabling tactile sensing capabilities for robotic systems."

    "abstract": "The steerability of catheter is critical to the success of interventional procedure. In this paper, a magnetic continuum robot is presumably mounted to the distal of a catheter to pull it in the narrow, bifurcate, tortuous pathways of the blood vessels. The continuum robot is actuated by a permanent magnet. It is linear and soft, which complicates its interaction with the magnet. However, it generates the omnidirectional deflection at its tip and improves its steerability instead. In the non-uniform field generated by a permanent magnet, besides magnetic torque, magnetic force is acting on the robot as well, and both are used to derive the dynamic equations to govern the interaction between the robot and the magnet, in terms of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. An iterative algorithm to calculate the magnet pose is proposed to generate an optimal moving magnetic field and actuate the robot to follow the planned trajectory at its tip. A robot prototype is fabricated, and the experimental results show that this prototype can accurately track the planned trajectories in 2D space by the magnet manipulation with a robot arm."

    "abstract": "In recent years, tactile sensors have become essential for robotic systems, particularly in tasks requiring high-precision interaction and manipulation. The Vision-Based Tactile Sensor (VBTS) represents a significant advancement in tactile sensing, utilizing cameras to monitor the deformation of soft materials at the sensor tip. Pressure applied to the sensor alters the light propagation path, thereby changing the image captured by the camera. By combining image processing and deep learning, VBTS provides highly accurate estimates of contact position and force, achieving micrometer-level resolution. This paper presents a novel VBTS design that leverages a light-conductive plate and a silicone membrane to enhance the sensor’s sensitivity to force perception. The soft, thin nature of the silicone membrane allows for precise detection of minimal forces, making it suitable for tasks involving highly deformable objects. Experimental results demonstrate the sensor’s capability in detecting contact areas and force distributions, which can be applied in diverse domains such as soft object assembly, medical assistance, and food processing. Moreover, the proposed VBTS outperforms traditional sensors by utilizing computationally efficient algorithms that maintain real-time performance without compromising resolution."

    "abstract": "A long-cherished vision of drones is to autonomously traverse through clutter to reach every corner of the world using onboard sensing and computation. In this paper, we combine onboard 3D lidar sensing and sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) to enable autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Compared to vision sensors, lidars appear to be more straightforward and accurate for geometric modeling of surroundings, which is one of the most important cues for successful obstacle avoidance. On the other hand, sim-to-real RL approach facilitates the realization of low-latency control, without the hierarchy of trajectory generation and tracking. We demonstrate that, with design choices of practical significance, we can effectively combine the advantages of 3D lidar sensing and RL to control a quadrotor through a low-level control interface at 50Hz. The key to successfully learn the policy in a lightweight way lies in a specialized surrogate of the lidar’s raw point clouds, which simplifies learning while retaining a fine-grained perception to detect narrow free space and thin obstacles. Simulation statistics demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system over alternatives, such as performing easier maneuvers and higher success rates at different speed constraints. With lightweight simulation techniques, the policy trained in the simulator can control a physical quadrotor, where the system can dodge thin obstacles and safely traverse randomly distributed obstacles."

    "abstract": "The multi-drone waypoint traversal has significant potential for aerial robot swarms in various applications. However, it still faces challenges including low time efficiency, susceptibility to local minima, poor resilience to external disturbances, high computational complexity, and high communication burden. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage swarm planning framework by integrating an offline global trajectory generator and an online distributed local trajectory planner. This approach not only ensures time-optimality but also enhances resistance to external disturbances. Specifically, a complementary progress constraint (CPC)-based global trajectory planning method is first presented to generate globally optimal reference trajectories. Then, by taking these trajectories as global guidance, a local planner is designed to guarantee collision-free traversal. In the local planner, we present a distributed local re-planning algorithm by embedding the positional constraints constructed by Voronoi diagrams into the model predictive contouring control (MPCC). The drones only exchange their position information, significantly reducing the communication load. Additionally, the Voronoi-based spatial constraints allow the swarms to eliminate the collision risk caused by asynchronous communication. To reduce onboard computational resource requirements, the local planner adopts the real-time iteration (RTI) technique, executing the optimization only once per control cycle. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of waypoint tracking accuracy, safety, and global time optimality."

The mapping process entails Sentinel-2 multispectral (10-20 m) data (level 2 processed) and Landsat-8 OLI data integrated in GEE with cloud masking and radiometric calibration as preprocessing steps. The Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) mapping was carried out based on the supervised classification through CART and Random Forest algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 92.53 percent and a Kappa coefficient of 0.91, and the accuracy of the 1,000 validation samples. NIR-NDVI and SAVI indices were used to classify the crop health, and temporal NDVI trends and phenological measures were used to predict yield. The comparative analysis indicates that the time spent on processing with the use of GEE is more than 70 percent shorter than the desktop workflow, allowing for conducting near-real-time tracking, as well as data sharing. Although it has been demonstrated to be efficient, Scopus-collected literature has shown that there is minimal use of GEE in agricultural studies (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;2$</tex> percent of the accessed LULC research articles), implying there is room to broadly adopt in the application of agricultural studies in regions where climate variability, food insecurity, and infrastructure inadequacy prevail."

Existing 3D MOT methods based on the Tracking-by-Detection framework typically use a single motion model to track an object throughout its entire tracking process. However, objects may change their motion patterns due to variations in the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce the Interacting Multiple Model filter in IMM-MOT, which accurately fits the complex motion patterns of individual objects, overcoming the limitation of single-model tracking in existing approaches. In addition, we incorporate a Damping Window mechanism into the trajectory lifecycle management, leveraging the continuous association status of trajectories to control their creation and termination, reducing the occurrence of overlooked low-confidence true targets. Furthermore, we propose the Distance-Based Score Enhancement module, which enhances the differentiation between false positives and true positives by adjusting detection scores, thereby improving the effectiveness of the Score Filter. On the NuScenes Val dataset, IMM-MOT outperforms most other single-modal models using 3D point clouds, achieving an AMOTA of 73.8%. Our project is available at https://github.com/Ap01lo/IMM-MOT."

This paper introduces Nezha-T, a novel, ultra-lightweight HAUV featuring a dual-stable floating state capability. This is achieved through an innovative center-of-gravity (CoG) arrangement method, which enables seamless transitions between upright and horizontal floating postures. This ability to stably floating in either orientation is crucial for stable water entry and exit, mitigating impact forces on the vehicle and its payload. Furthermore, to counteract the residual buoyancy inherent in this design, a zero-lift pitch angle is incorporated into the control system, improving depth-keeping and pitch control performance. The proposed design were rigorously validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, pool experiments, and open-water field tests. The results confirm the feasibility of the dual-stable floating states, demonstrate stable cross-domain traversal, verify the effectiveness of the depth-keeping control system, and validate the vehicle’s fixed-wing flight capability."

Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability. Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides. Extensive simulations show a 10–20% increase in throughput and a significant reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant factories."

More importantly, to compensate for the control performance sacrificed by GP linearization and reduce on-chip GP computations, we design active data collection strategies using Bayesian optimization with additive GP, reducing the performance sacrifice as much as possible. Specifically, we decompose the performance into force and trajectory partitions, where the force model is for the downstream controller, and the trajectory model is used to guide collection.

A method for estimating the direction of arrival of a radio signal based on maximizing the modulus of the vector sum of complex signals of two receiving channels with the introduction of an artificial phase shift has been developed and experimentally verified. An automated direction-finding complex with an adaptive antenna base installation system based on a ball-screw transmission has been implemented, providing an optimal interelement distance for different frequencies.

However, LiDAR-based one-shot global localization methods encounter challenges, including local feature matching errors, sensitivity to dynamic objects, and computational complexity in the absence of an initial pose. To address these issues, we propose a one-shot LiDAR-semantic-graph-based global localization method. To mitigate the interference of dynamic objects on localization, we extract stable semantic objects from LiDAR point clouds using dynamic curved voxel clustering and subsequently construct a semantic graph. Furthermore, we leverage the distribution characteristics of the semantic objects to quickly filter candidate retrievals and construct a cost matrix for the Hungarian algorithm, utilizing a semantic topological histogram to solve vertex matching. This yields a coarse pose estimate, which is subsequently refined using Fast-GICP. We demonstrate the superior localization performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple large-scale outdoor datasets, including MulRan, MCD, and Apollo. Our method will be open-sourced and accessible at: https://github.com/Hfx-J/SGGL."

    "abstract": "Continuum robots, known for their compliance in unstructured environments, face limitations due to the lack of rotational degrees of freedom (DOFs) about the backbone. This prevents them from compensating undesired torsional deformation and performing 6-DOF control of the end-effector, thereby restricting their mobility. This paper presents a continuum robot with integrated dual rotational DOFs. One is integrated at the arm base to compensate for torsional deformation caused by external loads, while the other one, located at the arm tip, enables full 6-DOF control of the end-effector. To control the robot, a screw-theory-based kinematic model and a kinematic control framework are proposed to enable real-time, simultaneous control of the end-effector’s position and orientation. Experimental results show that the arm base rotational joint can fully compensate for undesired torsional deformation caused by a 1000 g payload. Thanks to the arm tip’s DOF and the proposed kinematic control framework, the robot’s end-effector can maintain a constant orientation while achieving open-loop path-tracking errors of only 3.3% of the arm’s length (930 mm), and successfully executing valve-closing tasks with coordinated 6-DOF motion, demonstrating the robot’s potential for industrial maintenance, human-robot interaction, and confined-space manipulation."

Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness.

    "abstract": "Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is crucial in developing advanced prosthetics, neurorobotics, and human-robot interaction (HRI). Surface electromyography (sEMG) and high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) have gained attention for their ability to capture the muscle activity underlying hand gestures. Although many models achieve high performance within the same subjects, generalizing across different subjects remains a significant challenge, limiting the practical application of these systems in real-world settings. Furthermore, most conventional approaches primarily focus on the steady phase of gestures, which slows down real-time prediction. To address these issues, we propose a cross-subject dynamic hand gesture recognition (DHGR) framework based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, referred to as ViT-DHGR. Our model focuses explicitly on the signal transient phase before gesture stabilization to reduce gesture prediction latency and counteract system control delays. By incorporating subject embeddings and transfer learning strategies, the proposed ViT-DHGR framework for 34 dynamic hand gestures achieved an accuracy of 76.44% for 10 subjects using only 1 repetition of gesture data, which improved to 85.03% with 2 repetitions. In addition, our proposed framework achieves over 16% higher average accuracy across test subjects using 1 repetition of data compared to training subject-specific models from scratch. This work demonstrates the potential of HD-sEMG for capturing dynamic hand gestures and highlights the benefits of cross-user knowledge transfer in reducing data requirements and enhancing practicality for robotic applications."

The micro-marker (2.4 mm-per side, 400 μm×400 μm each square) is used for positioning the end-effector under microscopic view. After the fabrication of the markers, the camera's internal parameter matrix was first calibrated. Subsequently, we conducted the detection effect of macro- and micro-markers. Since the observation effect of micro-markers is different under the microscope, the detection distance of the micro-marker was corrected and compensated, and the fixed reference marker was introduced for the correction in different focus heights. Finally, based on detection markers, a robotic manipulator, integrated with a microfluidic chip as an end-effector, was employed to demonstrate the micromanipulation of loading oocytes. The proposed strategy has a potential application in the biology laboratory automation."

    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation social robots need to track pedestrian movements in real-time with high precision to optimize path planning and avoid collisions. However, the main challenge of pedestrian tracking lies in the significant variations in human posture, which differ from rigid-body structures like vehicles. In this paper, we propose an Efficient LiDAR-based 3D Pedestrian Tracking Network (ELPTNet). First, our ELPTNet employs a 3D object detector to extract directional 3D pedestrian bounding boxes from LiDAR point clouds. Then, our ELPTNet employs a Constant Acceleration (CA) model and prediction confidence for target trajectory prediction. During the data association process, it integrates geometric, appearance, and motion features to enhance the robustness and real-time performance of 3D MOT when targets are temporarily occluded. Experimental results demonstrate that our ELPTNet achieves the highest ranking on the large-scale JRDB dataset for the 3D tracking task, outperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with improvements of 8.4% in MOTA and 6.6% in HOTA. Additionally, our ELPTNet attains an inference speed of 61 frames per second (FPS) on a single CPU. Therefore, our method enables accurate and real-time tracking of multiple pedestrians.

The proposed approach generates a geometric path to the target location. At each waypoint, the minimum distance between the drone’s convex hull and surrounding obstacles is determined, allowing the computation of the velocity constraints. By slowing down near obstacles and accelerating in open spaces, the method enhances both safety and maneuverability. The framework is validated through real-world experiments using the OmniOcta UAV, demonstrating its ability to navigate through constrained spaces. Furthermore, we present an experimental study to investigate key sources of tracking deviations, including propeller dynamics and aerodynamic interactions near obstacles."

The 6D pose tracking results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose tracking.

Traditional methods focus on optimizing the visiting order of frontiers based on current observations, which may lead to local-minimal results. Recently, by predicting the structure of the unseen environment, the exploration efficiency can be further improved. However, in a cluttered environment, due to the randomness of obstacles, the ability to predict is weak. Moreover, this inaccuracy will lead to limited improvement in exploration. Therefore, we propose FPUNet which can be efficient in predicting the layout of noisy indoor environments. Then, we extract the segmentation of rooms and construct their topological connectivity based on the predicted map. The visiting order of these predicted rooms is optimized which can provide high-level guidance for exploration. The FPUNet is compared with other network architectures which demonstrates it is the SOTA method for this task. Extensive experiments in simulations show that our method can shorten the path length by 2.18% to 34.60% compared to the baselines."

    "abstract": "The goal of extrinsic calibration is the alignment of sensor data to ensure an accurate representation of the surroundings and enable sensor fusion applications. From a safety perspective, sensor calibration is a key enabler of autonomous driving. In the current state of the art, a trend from target-based offline calibration towards targetless online calibration can be observed. However, online calibration is subject to strict real-time and resource constraints which are not met by state-of-the-art methods. This is mainly due to the high number of parameters to estimate, the reliance on geometric features, or the dependence on specific vehicle maneuvers. To meet these requirements and ensure the vehicle's safety at any time, we propose a miscalibration detection framework that shifts the focus from the direct regression of calibration parameters to a binary classification of the calibration state, i.e., calibrated or miscalibrated. Therefore, we propose a contrastive learning approach that compares embedded features in a latent space to classify the calibration state of two different sensor modalities. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the feature embeddings and challenging calibration errors that highlight the performance of our approach. As a result, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of detection performance, inference time, and resource demand.

However, to become long-term companions, such robots must learn user-specific preferences and adapt their behaviors in real time. We propose a Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework for modeling human safety preferences over representative variables like force, velocity, and proximity. These variables are modeled as adaptive linear constraints, with a belief over their upper bounds that is updated online based on noisy human feedback. By modeling the belief as phase dependent, the model captures varying preferences across different task phases. The robot then solves a hierarchical optimization to select actions that respect both the learned constraints and robot motion limits. Our method does not require offline training data and can be applied directly to diverse physical interaction tasks and operation modes (tele-operated or autonomous). A pilot study shows that our approach effectively learns user preferences and improves perceived safety while reducing user effort compared to baselines."

Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the physical sensor’s outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor’s output.

However, methods that use neural networks in a simple L2-regression setup fail to approximate multi-modal (set-valued) solution distributions caused by local optima found by the numerical solver or nonconvex constraints, such as obstacles, significantly limiting the applicability of approximate MPC in practice. We solve this issue by using diffusion models to accurately represent the complete solution distribution (i.e., all modes) up to kilohertz sampling rates. This work shows that diffusion-based AMPC significantly outperforms L2-regression-based approximate MPC for multi-modal action distributions. In contrast to most earlier work on IL, we also focus on running the diffusion-based controller at a higher rate and in joint space instead of end-effector space. Additionally, we propose the use of gradient guidance during the denoising process to consistently pick the same mode in closed loop to prevent switching between solutions. We propose using the cost and constraint satisfaction of the original MPC problem during parallel sampling of solutions from the diffusion model to pick a better mode online. We evaluate our method on the fast and accurate control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator both in simulation and on hardware deployed at 250 Hz, achieving a speedup of more than 70 times compared to solving the MPC problem online and also outperforming the numerical optimization (used for training) in success ratio."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a robust wrench-feasible control framework. First, we design a payload controller based on an extended state observer to estimate and compensate for the total disturbance acting on the payload. Next, a piecewise wrench adjustment strategy (PWAS) is proposed to ensure that the payload wrench balances feasibility and path-tracking ability. Finally, we propose an adaptive cable configuration strategy (ACCS) inspired by capacity margin. When external disturbances approach the system’s wrench capacity, ACCS can dynamically adjust cable configuration to maximize the capacity margin.

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.Project Website: https://macsclab.github.io/LLM_FCCA"

    "abstract": "Air pollutants significantly impact human health, from mild symptoms to premature death. The devastating earthquake in Kahramanmaraş on February 6, 2023, increased air pollution risks due to debris and heating activities. Estimating post-earthquake air quality is crucial for controlling pollutants like PM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</inf> and SO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, which affect respiratory health. This study applies machine learning methods to assess air quality using pollutant concentration data from Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, and Adana, sourced from the Ministry of Environment’s Air Monitoring Stations. Five machine learning algorithms were evaluated; the Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy (0.9987 and 0.9910), while Logistic Regression performed the worst. Results indicate that the proposed model can effectively predict air quality and support authorities in mitigating pollution-related risks."

This paper introduces a new approach for MAMP based on Mixed Integer Conic Programming (MICP) formulation that complements these existing approaches. We show that our formulation is valid and test our approach against various baselines, including a graph-based method that combines search and sampling, as well as different MIP formulations. The numerical results show that the solutions found by our approach are sometimes eight times closer to the true optimum than the ones found by the baseline when given the same amount of runtime limit. We also verify our approach with multiple drones in a lab setting."

    "abstract": "With a growing number of robots being deployed across diverse applications, robust multimodal anomaly detection becomes increasingly important. In robotic manipulation, failures typically arise from (1) robot-driven anomalies due to an insufficient task model or hardware limitations, and (2) environment-driven anomalies caused by dynamic environmental changes or external interferences. Conventional anomaly detection methods focus either on the first by low-level statistical modeling of proprioceptive signals or the second by deep learning-based visual environment observation, each with different computational and training data requirements. To effectively capture anomalies from both sources, we propose a mixture-of-experts framework that integrates the complementary detection mechanisms with a visual-language model for environment monitoring and a Gaussian-mixture regression-based detector for tracking deviations in interaction forces and robot motions. We introduce a confidence-based fusion mechanism that dynamically selects the most reliable detector for each situation. We evaluate our approach on both household and industrial tasks using two robotic systems, demonstrating a 60% reduction in detection delay while improving frame-wise anomaly detection performance compared to individual detectors."

    "abstract": "In indoor parking lots, the use of RTK/GNSS for vehicle localization is often impractical due to the significantly smaller space compared to outdoor roads, which demands higher precision in both mapping and localization. Although feature point based visual SLAM algorithms have achieved high localization accuracy, they impose significant storage demands on embedded systems, and the visual feature point maps are not time-stable and are sensitive to lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose a real-time mapping and localization system for multi-floor parking lot. For the mapping part, we introduce a map-free SLAM method for precise ego-pose estimation, along with an efficient incremental map update framework that supports loop closure and multi-session mapping tasks. In the localization part, a semantic map is reused for vehicle localization based on bidirectional incentive descriptors. We incorporate degenerate cases into our optimization process, which greatly enhances the localization results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive system proposed for multi-floor parking lots. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art mapping and localization accuracy in multi-floor environments on embedded platforms."

    "abstract": "This paper presents Virtual Teach and Repeat (VirT&R): an extension of the Teach and Repeat (T&R) framework that enables GPS-denied, zero-shot autonomous ground vehicle navigation in untraversed environments. VirT&R leverages aerial imagery captured for a target environment to train a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model so that dense point clouds and photo-textured meshes can be extracted. The NeRF mesh is used to create a high-fidelity simulation of the environment for piloting an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to virtually define a desired path. The mission can then be executed in the actual target environment by using NeRF-generated point cloud submaps associated along the path and an existing LiDAR Teach and Repeat (LT&R) framework. We benchmark the repeatability of VirT&R on over 12 km of autonomous driving data using physical markings that allow a sim-to-real lateral path-tracking error to be obtained and compared with LT&R. VirT&R achieved measured root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 19.5 cm and 18.4 cm in two different environments, which are slightly less than one tire width (24 cm) on the robot used for testing, and respective maximum errors were 39.4 cm and 47.6 cm. This was done using only the NeRF-derived teach map, demonstrating that VirT&R has similar closed-loop path-tracking performance to LT&R but does not require a human to manually teach the path to the UGV in the actual environment."

    "abstract": "Traditional zoo enrichment methods often lack flexible, non-food-based interactive elements that support animal autonomy, agency, and meaningful engagement. Enrichment that responds dynamically to animal behavior offers promising alternatives to support species-typical activities while giving animals meaningful choices in their experience. We present the design and evaluation protocol for an interactive acoustic enrichment system that transforms a familiar swing into an agency-based interface for zoo-housed black-and-white colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza). Our system maps swing amplitude to progressive soundscape layers—stream, insect, and bird sounds—allowing monkeys to control the complexity of their auditory environment through natural swinging behavior. Unlike passive enrichment, this approach gives animals direct control over their sensory experience, rewarding physical activity with increasingly rich acoustic feedback. The system offers dual audio outputs: an embedded speaker for direct animal enrichment and an external speaker for visitor education, with zookeepers controlling configuration through a mobile application. We propose a three-phase evaluation protocol comparing passive and interactive swing usage through sensor data, behavioral observations, and keeper assessments. This work contributes to Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research by illustrating how zoo infrastructure can be augmented into responsive interfaces, providing a methodological framework for developing species-specific, enrichment systems that give animals meaningful control over their environment."

This study addresses the challenges associated with State Grid Corporation's internal process of medical insurance claims, including demanding workload, varying medical insurance policies in different regions, and medical documents with changing formats and unqualified image quality. It innovatively presents a novel insurance claims processing workflow integrated with intelligent techniques. This solution works with an intelligent mechanism for claims process automation, risk management, and business data monitoring, in a bid to transform claims processing into an AI-powered, efficient system. Using this solution, OCR can automatically extract key information, including units and amounts from medical invoices, while with the support of natural language processing, the conditions and prescriptions listed in diagnosis certificates can be analyzed quickly. Furthermore, it thoroughly screens and verifies medical content, prices and other cost details from medical insurance data. The rule-based system that the system hinges on automatically matches insurance claims with insurance policies, making the verification of medical insurance premiums and corresponding compensation faster and more efficient. In addition to reducing labor costs and raising processing efficiency, this technology also allows for an intelligent compensation self-service procedure, which is conducive to enterprises’ transformation into the digital environment and scale both their economic and societal value creation."

The method, called Semantic Similarity Understanding Network (SSUN), combines a Transformer encoder for identifying semantic relationships between data entries with a text-to-text generation model for producing contextually appropriate answers. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments by using paraphrased queries and compared SSUN with several baseline models, including T5-Base, T5-Small, BART, and ProphetNet. The results indicate that SSUN achieves higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in handling queries that are semantically equivalent but phrased differently. Notably, SSUN can also detect and appropriately respond to out-of-domain questions by returning “no relevant information” instead of generating inaccurate results. These findings suggest that SSUN provides a more flexible and semantically aware interface for querying structured bibliographic data through natural language."

This paper proposes a co-construction scheme of credit risk control model for small and medium-sized banks based on federated transfer learning, and designs an improved federated adversarial transfer learning algorithm. The algorithm strengthens the extraction of key risk features through the attention mechanism, optimizes cross-domain knowledge transfer by using adversarial networks, and realizes model aggregation by adaptive weight adjustment. The experiment uses the UCI credit data set and simulated small and medium-sized bank data, and is carried out under the FATE federated learning framework. The algorithm is compared with five algorithms including FedAvg and XGBoost. The results show that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches 92.3%, which is 7.8 percentage points higher than FedAvg and 5.2 percentage points higher than XGBoost; the recall rate is 89.5%, which is 6.2 and 4.1 percentage points higher than the comparison algorithm respectively; the F1 value reaches 90.9%, which is the best. The model converged stably within 150 iterations, and the convergence speed was 30% higher than that of the traditional algorithm. The privacy attack experiment showed that the scheme could reduce the success rate of member reasoning attacks to 3.2%, significantly protecting data privacy. The experiment confirmed that the scheme effectively improved the performance of the credit risk control model of small and medium-sized banks and achieved safe and efficient model co-construction."

We also outline practical strategies for implementing co-creative tutoring, including task allocation between humans and AI based on Bloom's Taxonomy,multi-modal interaction design,and guidelines for teacher-AI collaboration. The proposed approach aims to leverage AI's strengths in data processing and content generation alongside human strengths in critical thinking and emotional intelligence,creating a synergistic learning environment.

    "abstract": "Digital images are inherently fragile and vulnerable to malicious tampering, significantly compromising their authenticity and integrity. Image recovery is crucial for restoring altered content and preserving the reliability of digital images. Traditional fragile watermarking methods achieve high-quality recovery but fail under post-processing attacks, while existing deep learning-based approaches offer some robustness, yet often produce lower-quality recovered images, typically with a PSNR of around 28 dB. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Symmetric Self-embedding Mechanism for High-Fidelity Image Recovery against tampering (SSEM-HIR), which is capable of restoring tampered images with high quality while maintaining some robustness against common attacks. Unlike existing methods that use the fragility of watermarking solely for tampering localization, SSEM-HIR is the first work to integrate fragility with spatial symmetry, enabling high-quality tampering recovery. Specifically, our SSEM-HIR employs a hierarchical watermark embedding module to embed an inverted version of the original image, utilizing spatial symmetry to retrieve lost information from the extracted watermark. To further improve recovery quality, we design a Dual-branch Region-based Self-Recovery module, where a Spatial-based Watermark Extraction block restores tampered regions using embedded watermark information, while a Frequency-assisted Image Repair block compensates for quality degradation in the untampered area. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves an average PSNR of 34.14 dB under common attack scenarios, including noise addition, image scaling, Gaussian blurring, and no post-processing. This represents an improvement of over 5 dB and 18% in recovered image quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

Two examples are finally given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed result."

    "abstract": "Natural ester insulating oils are environmentally friendly alternatives to mineral oils, but their high viscosity limits their applicability in cold regions. To address this challenge, this study proposes a virtual screening framework that uses GAN to generate insulating oil molecules and a viscosity prediction model to select low-viscosity candidate molecules. The GAN model generates 4,034 candidate triglyceride structures, which are evaluated using an XGBoost model with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> value ranging from 0.84 to 0.92. From these, nine low-viscosity candidates are selected based on their predicted viscosity and molecular weight. Next, Density Functional Theory (DFT) is performed to calculate key properties such as molecular ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA) and HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which in turn identifies molecules with good insulating properties. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that the selected molecules exhibit a 26.23% reduction in kinematic viscosity at 273.15 K compared to commercial ester oils. These findings provide theoretical guidance for the molecular-level design of insulating oils suitable for low-temperature scenarios, offering a computational foundation for developing eco-friendly alternatives with optimized properties."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of ultra-high voltage power transmission, large-capacity, compact oil-immersed transformers have emerged as a new trend in green power equipment development. Natural ester (NE) insulating liquid, known for its high flash point and environmental friendliness, is gradually replacing conventional mineral insulating oil. However, the presence of unsaturated C=C double bonds and β-H functional groups in NE promotes the formation of significant amounts of stray gas. Currently, effective methods to suppress stray gas are lacking. To address this issue, this study constructs a composite system of NE and TMPN-NE based on Amsterdam Modeling Suite (AMS) software to investigate trimethylolpropane nonanoate (TMPN) component regulation on NE and the suppression mechanism of stray gas. The molecular-level decomposition behavior of the TMPN-NE system is analyzed using the ReaxFF reactive force field. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient of oxygen molecules is calculated to elucidate the mechanism behind TMPN’s gas suppression effect. This study provides essential theoretical evidence for transformer condition monitoring and gas suppression."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a robust trajectory tracking control problem of an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) subject to external disturbances, model uncertainties, actuator saturation and faults. The underactuated problem is solved by introducing a coordinate transformation method that takes the hand position point as an output, which in turn simplifies the controller design. On that basis, two fault-tolerant super-twisting controllers are proposed to solve two different cases of the problem. The first controller is designed to address lumped disturbances with known boundaries. In order to overcome the disturbances more efficiently, a leakage-type adaptive (LTA) law is employed in the second controller to update the control gains and compensates the disturbances without their prior information about the derivative boundaries. Also, an anti-windup compensator is integrated in the controller design to solve the saturation non-linearity problem by incorporating auxiliary variables. Since the designed control law is continuous, it can effectively attenuate the chattering phenomenon and ensure that the tracking errors converge in finite time. Finally, the simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the presented approach."

    "abstract": "Video summarization aims to generate a compact, informative, and representative synopsis of raw videos, which is crucial for browsing, analyzing, and understanding video content. Dominant approaches in video summarization primarily rely on recurrent or convolutional neural networks, and more recently on encoder-only transformer architectures.However, these methods typically suffer from several limitations in parallelism, modeling long-range dependencies, and providing explicit generative capabilities.To address these issues, we propose a transformer-like architecture named FullTransNet with two-fold ideas. First, it uses a full transformer with an encoder-decoder structure as an alternative architecture for video summarization. As the full transformer is specifically designed for sequence transduction tasks, its direct application to video summarization is both intuitive and effective. Second, it replaces the standard full attention mechanism with a combination of local and global sparse attention, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies while significantly reducing computational costs. This local-global sparse attention is applied exclusively at the encoder side, where the majority of computations occur, further enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SumMe and TVSum, demonstrate that our model achieves F-scores of 54.4% and 63.9%, respectively, while maintaining relatively low computational and memory requirements. These results surpass the second-best performing methods by 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of FullTransNet."

    "abstract": "Leveraging video pre-trained models for video downstream tasks has recently emerged with promising performance. Except for the full fine-tuning paradigm, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) exists as a promising way and has not yet been fully explored in video-to-video transfer learning. While current PETL approaches succeed to reduce parameter quantity and computation cost, they overlook the critical spatiotemporal property in video modality. In this paper, we first propose a novel metric to quantify the spatiotemporal information bias across video datasets and uncover its impact on transfer preferences through systematic analysis. Based on the analysis, we introduce an innovative parameter-efficient transfer learning method, named Adaptive SpatioTemporal Adapter (AST-Adapter). Our approach automatically adjusts layer-wise architectures with different spatiotemporal adapter modules to exploit the intrinsics of downstream tasks to achieve adaptive spatiotemporal learning, thus delivering robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on five datasets across action recognition and action detection task show that AST-Adapter surpasses both video-to-video and image-to-video approaches, whilst keeping the advantage of parameter efficiency. Notably, AST-Adapter achieves 89.9% on Kinectics-400, 80.3% on HMDB51 and 97.7% on UCF101 while introduces only 1% to 10% tunable parameters.

    "abstract": "Linear embeddings support interactive visual exploration by mapping high-dimensional (nD) data into a two-dimensional space. Despite their popularity, selecting meaningful projection parameters remains a key challenge due to the infinite 2n-dimensional parameter space. Once an informative projection is found, users often seek similar ones that emphasize specific items differently while preserving global structure. For instance: Do clusters become outliers under slight changes? Can grouped items separate-or merge-through parameter adjustments? Which changes to the embedding parameters lead to such projections - and do they exist at all? Answering these questions efficiently is critical for effective visual search. Yet, current methods-such as projection tours or manual parameter tuning-are time-consuming and risk overlooking important views, including those of specific interest. We propose Composition Operators, a mathematical foundation for a novel set-of-point manipulation concept for linear embeddings-such as Star Coordinates-as an alternative approach to selecting informative embedding parameters in a more controllable manner with respect to the desired outcome. Users specify item-based constraints on the projection result; the corresponding 2n parameters are then derived automatically, eliminating the need to exhaustively search the entire parameter space to get a similar outcome. Neither the embedding space nor the set of parameters is altered - only the mechanism for navigating and selecting parameters is redefined. We provide closed-form solutions for this and demonstrate our interactive prototype on nD datasets from the UCI repository."

    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GPs) have attracted considerable attention in assisting evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to solve computationally expensive optimization problems (EOPs) because they can directly provide information about the uncertainty of their predictions. However, the computational complexity of GPs grows cubically as the amount of data increases, which severely limits their computational efficiency in high-dimensional expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs). To address this limitation, we propose a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA) that integrates multilayer perceptron (MLP) grouping with sparse GPs, referred to as MLPSGP-SAEA. First, the MLP grouping selects a subspace from the original space by evaluating the impact of each decision variable on the objective functions. Then, for each objective function, a sparse GP model is employed, and the locations of pseudo-input points are optimized to enhance computational efficiency while improving model accuracy. Moreover, an adaptive sparse and diverse (ASD) infill criterion is proposed, based on the characteristics of the sparse GP model predictive distribution, to better balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four benchmark suites and an aerodynamic design optimization problem. The experimental results demonstrate that MLPSGP-SAEA exhibits significant competitive advantages over the state-of-the-art SAEAs."

    "abstract": "The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of multirobot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This article defines the multiobjective agricultural multielectrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task-sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA’s superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA’s competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multirobot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation."

Second, an ultralocal prediction model of BIPMSM is developed and an ESO is constructed to estimate the unknown disturbances in the ultralocal model and perform feedforward compensation. In addition, the reference voltage is calculated with the deadbeat principle. Finally, the proposed MFPC control method is verified through simulation and experimental tests under various operating conditions, including load disturbances and parameter variations. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFPC method exhibits strong disturbance rejection capability, parameter robustness, and excellent static and dynamic response characteristics."

This paper proposes a signal-path recognition method to help with the auto-generation of readable analytical PZ expressions from a circuit netlist. Prior symbolic PZ extraction methods have limitations in either requiring numerical references or yielding insufficiently compactness after simplification. The proposed method circumvents these limitations via a two-phase process: a topology simplification phase and a term simplification phase. In the topology simplification phase, signal paths of a multi-stage Op-Amp are detected via programmable routines, capturing the main amplification stages and frequency compensation paths, based on which the transfer function and PZs can be generated. In the term simplification phase, we propose a method that only makes reference to the magnitude orders of terms by assuming elementary device parameter orders based on a technology file. Sixteen test cases featuring varied compensation strategies are employed to demonstrate the applicability of this research. Our implementation delivers a fully automated netlist-to-PZ workflow, which can generate informative PZ expressions in compact and readable forms within minutes, offering useful insights to the circuit designer."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving sequential decisionmaking problems, yet deploying these algorithms on resource-constrained edge devices remains a significant challenge due to limited power and area budgets. While prior FPGA-based research has centered on Q-learning implementations, studies on Actor–Critic methods remain relatively limited, particularly in the context of low-cost embedded platforms. This paper addresses this gap by presenting a hardware–software co-design of an Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) framework tailored for edge deployment on a low-cost Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We propose and evaluate three distinct hardware architectures, focusing on resource consumption and latency. Our hybrid computation model offloads feedforward (FF) and backpropagation (BP) operations to the FPGA’s programmable logic while leveraging the processing system to perform weight updates with PyTorch, enabling flexible optimizer selection. Evaluated in CartPole-v1, Acrobot-v1, and LunarLander-v2 environments, the resource-efficient design achieves higher power efficiency than an Intel i9-11900K CPU. A low-latency variant with four compute units demonstrates a throughput increase of up to 3.4×, 21.7× better power efficiency, and 21.6× greater energy efficiency. These results confirm the viability of deploying A2C algorithms on resource-constrained FPGAs, enabling efficient RL-based solutions for practical edge-computing applications."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a zero-voltage-switched (ZVS) half-bridge modular equalizer that utilizes a capacitively coupled AC link to enable scalable module-to-cell (M2C) energy redistribution in a series-connected battery string. The proposed architecture transfers charges to any lower voltage cell(s) within the battery module naturally without sensing the individual cell voltage. Each half-bridge converter converts the voltage of its corresponding battery module to an AC signal, which is then transmitted to the AC link via a transformer and two decoupling capacitors. Since all modules are interconnected via the shared AC link, any low-voltage battery cell(s) receives energy from the link, thereby enabling effective energy transfer among modules. The proposed equalizer enables an adaptive current distribution among cells without relying on any selection switches. A 16-cell prototype (two modules of eight 3.6V 18650 cells each) was built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology. The equalization performances of the equalizer under single-module operation and dual-module operation have been evaluated. The proposed equalizer offers advantages in scalability, control complexity, and efficiency over conventional approaches, which makes it well suited for large-scale energy storage applications."

    "abstract": "Learning based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress in recent years, and they can now produce solutions to complex tasks. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e. they cease to move beyond a small region of states, often indefinitely, when they reach certain states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency. However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach, Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger manipulation."

The system confers two primary benefits: it facilitates simultaneous UAVs co-localization and real-time dense map reconstruction, and it recovers the metric scale even in GNSS-denied conditions. To achieve these advantages, Ultrawideband (UWB) measurements, monocular Visual Odometry (VO), and co-visibility observations are jointly employed to recover both relative positions and global UAV poses, thereby ensuring optimality at both local and global scales. In the proposed methodology, a two-stage optimization strategy is proposed to reduce optimization burden. Initially, relative Sim3 transformations among UAVs are swiftly estimated, with UWB measurements facilitating metric scale recovery in the absence of GNSS. Subsequently, a global pose optimization is performed to effectively mitigate cumulative drift. By integrating UWB, VO, and co-visibility data within this framework, both local geometric consistency and global pose accuracy are robustly maintained. Through comprehensive simulation and empirical real-world testing, we demonstrate that our system not only improves UAV positioning accuracy in challenging scenarios but also facilitates the high-quality, online integration of dense point clouds in large-scale areas. This research offers valuable contributions and practical techniques for precise, real-time map reconstruction using an autonomous UAV fleet, particularly in GNSS-denied environments."

The complexity of the task arises from its multi-objective nature, the large exploration space, and the sim-to-real gap. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. In the first stage, we randomly search for a reward function that balances key objectives: directed flight, obstacle avoidance, formation maintenance, and zero-shot policy deployment. The second stage applies this reward function to more complex scenarios and utilizes curriculum learning to accelerate policy training. Additionally, we incorporate an attention-based observation encoder to improve formation maintenance and adaptability to varying obstacle densities. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method outperforms both planning-based and RL-based baselines in terms of collision-free rates and formation maintenance across static, dynamic, and mixed obstacle scenarios. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our curriculum learning strategy and attention-based encoder.

    "abstract": "Physical laboratory experiments occupy an important role in the training curricula for many technical professions in spite of the practical challenges their execution poses for educators and students. Virtual laboratories offer a solution to some of these challenges, but raise their own issues related to student experience and pedagogic effectiveness. In this study, a serious game in a custom e-learning platform was developed to simulate hematology laboratory methods taught within a bachelor's program in biomedical engineering. Feedback was collected from student users to assess how the design of the platform affected their experience, and how their experiences af-fected learning outcomes. A systematic mixed methods approach is demonstrated for analyzing this feedback to guide iterative revisions to the platform toward improved user experience and learning outcomes."

This article explores how environmental factors, such as carbon dioxide (CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) and particulate matter (PM), act as physiological stressors that can impact the effectiveness of the recovery process. A machine learning analysis was implemented to analyze HRV variations across diverse air quality conditions. The analysis shows that elevated concentrations of PM are significantly correlated with a reduction in HRV, indicating physiological stress that could hinder a patient’s recovery. The proposed system, which integrates real-time physiological and environmental monitoring using IoT devices, offers a new tool for personalizing rehabilitation. This study demonstrates the potential of using integrated monitoring systems and machine learning to optimize rehabilitation strategies, which can lead to more effective, personalized patient care and improved recovery outcomes."

However, traditional IL methods are limited by their reliance on high-quality, often scarce, expert data, and suffer from covariate shift. To address these challenges, recent advances in offline IL have incorporated suboptimal, unlabeled datasets into the training. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance policy learning from mixed-quality offline datasets by leveraging task-relevant trajectory fragments and rich environmental dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a state-based search framework that stitches state-action pairs from imperfect demonstrations, generating more diverse and informative training trajectories. Experimental results on standard IL benchmarks and real-world robotic tasks showcase that our proposed method significantly improves both generalization and performance.

    "abstract": "Despite the nuclear industry’s reliance on advanced robots being operated by humans, much of the existing research overlooks the operator’s perspective in the context of nuclear decommissioning. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the specific needs and requirements of robot operators in nuclear environments. Three focus groups of experienced robot operators from the UK Atomic Energy Authority and Sellafield Ltd. were conducted to explore key themes, including the operator’s role, tasks where robots are employed, and the risks associated with robot use. Findings reveal that: (1) robots in critical tasks are typically controlled by a team of operators; (2) for human-robot interfaces safety and reliability are the most important features, before effectiveness, intuitiveness and task focus; (3) due to high task variety operators see a need for various types of robots; and (4) operator error is regarded as the most significant and unpredictable risk. Based on these insights, a comprehensive set of 10 robot-specific requirements and 10 overall user requirements has been formulated. The paper provides recommendations for robot operators and designers, detailing how these identified requirements can inform the development of future teleoperated robots for nuclear decommissioning tasks."

In this paper, we present a novel variable-stiffness neck exoskeleton with pneumatic-driven tensile actuators for prolonged head flexion assistance. Its innovative design facilitates unrestricted head movement while providing expected neck support, thereby minimizing strain on antagonist muscle groups. Comprehensive experimental evaluations were conducted to assess the system’s performance. Transitional response times between flexible and rigid states were 0.28 s and 0.46 s, respectively. Experimental trials involving five healthy subjects demonstrated that the average muscular activity reduction of the splenius capitis and the sternocleidomastoid muscles were 38.8 ± 2.0% and 9.7 ± 2.5%, respectively. These experimental results demonstrated great potential of the exoskeleton in practical application for alleviating the physical burden during prolonged head flexion."

While existing approaches primarily rely on low-level state information and isolated visual features, lacking the high-level semantic understanding that humans use to reason about movement and posture, we propose HeStIa, a novel framework that bridges visual perception, natural language understanding, and robotic control through multimodal learning. Our framework leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to establish a semantic bridge between visual observations and motion control, enabling robots to understand and adjust their locomotion through both visual and linguistic modalities. By leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), HeStIa establishes a semantic connection between visual observations and motion control, enabling robots to comprehend and adapt their locomotion through both visual and linguistic modalities. Our approach extracts spatiotemporal visual features from robot movements and transforms them into a cross-modal embedding space shared with textual descriptions. HeStIa incorporates an innovative vision-language-motion fusion mechanism to provide informed, context-aware feedback during the dynamic learning process. Through an asynchronous design, HeStIa effectively mitigates the inference delays typically associated with MLLMs while maintaining real-time performance in dynamic scenarios. The cross-modal representations learned by HeStIa facilitate more intuitive and efficient locomotion learning by grounding visual observations in natural language descriptions. Our comprehensive evaluation shows substantial improvements in motion naturalness, stability, and adaptability across diverse environmental conditions."

We introduce a method for identifying such risks in an underwater scene in the context of AUV debris search and removal tasks. Our approach integrates a vision language model (VLM) with monocular depth estimation to effectively classify and localize objects in a marine scene, specifically submerged marine debris. We use the pixel distance and depth difference using the monocular depth map to identify entities that are sensitive to harm in proximity to the debris. We collect and annotate a custom dataset containing images in three different marine and aquatic environments containing debris and other such sensitive entities, and compare classification performance for different types of prompts. We observe that the prompts describing the debris properties (e.g., \"eroded trash\") demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy compared to the use of object names directly as prompts. Our method successfully identifies debris that is safe to remove in complex scenes and turbid water conditions, highlighting the potential of using VLMs for risk assessment in AUV operations in the diverse underwater domain."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable potential for generalizable robotic manipulation. The performance of VLA models can be improved by integrating with action chunking, a critical technique for effective control. However, action chunking linearly scales up action dimensions in VLA models with increased chunking sizes. This reduces the inference efficiency. Therefore, accelerating VLA integrated with action chunking is an urgent need. To tackle this problem, we propose PD-VLA, the first parallel decoding framework for VLA models integrated with action chunking. Our framework reformulates autoregressive decoding as a nonlinear system solved by parallel fixed-point iterations. This approach preserves model performance with mathematical guarantees while significantly improving decoding speed. In addition, it enables training-free acceleration without architectural changes, as well as seamless synergy with existing acceleration techniques. Extensive simulations validate that our PD-VLA maintains competitive success rates while achieving 2.52× execution frequency on manipulators (with 7 degrees of freedom) compared with the fundamental VLA model. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the most effective settings for acceleration. Finally, real-world experiments validate its high applicability across different tasks."

While this SS-based approach is effective under specific environments, it fails to perform well across other common environmental factors such as different seasons, hours of the day, weather and illumination levels. In this work, we propose Robust Structural Semantic Segmentation (RSSS), a novel patch to the existing SS solution without requiring re-training for new environments. The core idea is to “Let Strong Help Weak”, where the results of semantic segmentation obtained under favorable/strong conditions are utilized to enhance the weaker ones in adverse settings. This improvement is achieved by leveraging house structures and spatial layouts, which remain largely invariant across various environments. Our evaluation shows that RSSS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and significantly enhances the robustness of SS and drone delivery across various environments.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning faces a critical challenge in synthesizing high-reward trajectories from suboptimal datasets while robustly handling the stochasticity inherent in real-world decision-making. While combination of return-conditioned sequence models, such as Decision Transformers (DT), and dynamics programming critics shows great potential in trajectory synthesis, their deterministic action generation and scale Q value critic often fails to distinguish intentional behavioral variability from detrimental noise, leading to suboptimal policy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Distributional Decision Transformer (DDT), a novel framework that unifies probabilistic return distribution modeling with autoregressive action generation. DDT introduces two key innovations: (1) a Gaussian stochastic return mechanism that reparameterizes target returns as samplable distributions, enabling diverse action candidate generation; and (2) an Implicit Quantile Network (IQN) critic embedded within the deciding loop, which evaluates actions across the full spectrum of return distributions (quantiles τ ~ U(0, 1)). In D4RL benchmarks, DDT achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 91.6 average normalized score in MuJoCo locomotion and 69.3 in sparse-reward settings. The results establish DDT as a principled solution for synthesis of risk-aware trajectory in offline RL."

Unlike previous vision-based teleoperation systems, we design novel low-cost devices to provide haptic feedback to the operator, enhancing immersion. Our system prioritizes safety by incorporating collision and singularity avoidance while maintaining real-time performance through innovative designs. Bunny-VisionPro outperforms prior systems on a standard task suite, achieving higher success rates and reduced task completion times. Moreover, the high-quality teleoperation demonstrations improve downstream imitation learning performance, leading to better generalizability. Notably, Bunny-VisionPro enables imitation learning with challenging multi-stage, long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks, which have rarely been addressed in previous work. Our system’s ability to handle bimanual manipulations while prioritizing safety and real-time performance makes it a powerful tool for advancing dexterous manipulation and imitation learning.

This targeted reconstruction focuses the world model on learning dynamics-relevant information, thereby reducing computational overhead and model complexity. Additionally, we incorporate prioritized experience replay to accelerate learning in newly explored regions of the maze and implement an autonomous marble reloader to eliminate manual resets. Together, these enhancements reduce the required collected experience from 5 hours to 1.5 hours while achieving comparable performance, and enable fully autonomous learning without human supervision."

The system consists of 3 omni wheel-based mobile robot for robust track following and a 1-DOF revolute joint-based manipulator for gait enhancement during track-based gait guidance. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, we conducted a pilot experiment with one stroke patient on a 15 m track. The experimental results showed that the robot could guide the patient along the track and enhance symmetry and balance, especially in the curved section of the track. Furthermore, the preferred walking speed of the participant on the track improved.

While these models are effective in predicting long-horizon state trajectories in deterministic environments, they face challenges in dynamic settings with moving obstacles. Effective collision avoidance demands continuous monitoring and adaptive decision-making. While re-planning at every time step could ensure safety, it introduces substantial computational overhead due to the repetitive prediction of overlapping state sequences—a process that is particularly costly with diffusion models, known for their intensive iterative sampling procedure. We propose an adaptive generative planning approach that dynamically adjusts re-planning frequency based on the uncertainty of action predictions. Our method minimizes the need for frequent, computationally expensive, and redundant re-planning while maintaining robust collision avoidance performance. In experiments, we obtain a 13.5% increase in the mean trajectory length and 12.7% increase in mean reward over long-horizon planning, indicating a reduction in collision rates, and improved ability to navigate the environment safely."

However, the limited flexibility of flexible needles and their complex interactions with tissues make it challenging to avoid critical organs along the puncture path. Preoperative path planning, which generates feasible collision-free trajectories, can effectively reduce repeated punctures and mitigate patient discomfort. To address this challenge, a flexible needle with increased maximum curvature is designed, which introduces more complex kinematic characteristics and poses greater challenges for trajectory planning under kinematic constraints. Then, for the first time, a convex feasible set (CFS)-based flexible needle trajectory planning method is developed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem posed by obstacle avoidance in unstructured surgical environments. Specifically, our method explicitly incorporates kinematic and curvature constraints, enabling direct generation of feasible trajectories without additional post-processing. Finally, comparative experiments on a self-developed robotic-assisted flexible needle system demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. In particular, the proposed trajectory generation method allows the flexible needle to effectively avoid obstacles and accurately reach the target."

The adopted concept is based on the advanced technique of cross-limit control with the purpose of maintaining the mixing ratio between 2 products in a system consisting of a total of 6 transfer functions. The control system was developed through a TIA Portal V16 simulator in the Siemens S7-1512 programmable logic controller interconnected to a remote station in the Profinet network connected to the transfer functions via OPC DA InduSoft. The method chosen to tune the simulator is Internal Model Control, highlighting specific performance criteria for each process variable.

    "abstract": "In multi-agent safety-critical scenarios, traditional autonomous driving frameworks face significant challenges in balancing safety constraints and task performance. These frameworks struggle to quantify dynamic interaction risks in real-time and depend heavily on manual rules, resulting in low computational efficiency and conservative strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a Dynamic Residual Safe Reinforcement Learning (DRS-RL) framework grounded in a safety-enhanced networked Markov decision process. It’s the first time that the weak-to-strong theory is introduced into multi-agent decision-making, enabling lightweight dynamic calibration of safety boundaries via a weak-to-strong safety correction paradigm. Based on the multi-agent dynamic conflict zone model, our framework accurately captures spatiotemporal coupling risks among heterogeneous traffic participants and surpasses the static constraints of conventional geometric rules. Moreover, a risk-aware prioritized experience replay mechanism mitigates data distribution bias by mapping risk to sampling probability. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in safety, efficiency, and comfort. Specifically, it reduces the collision rate by up to 92.17%, while the safety model accounts for merely 27% of the main model’s parameters."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework based on velocity obstacles to address dynamic obstacle avoidance problem for constrained mobile robots. The framework establishes a nonlinear mapping from the control domain to the velocity space based on the robot’s kinematic model and input constraints. This mapping defines the Velocity Feasible Region (VFR) as the set of reachable velocities at the next time step. Utilizing the VFR, we propose a gradient field, called the Dynamically Constrained Gradient Velocity Obstacle (DGVO), to represent the feasible motion region for mobile robots. DGVO preserves the original feasible region of the mobile robot. Based on DGVO, we formulate an unconstrained gradient descent optimization problem to compute collision-free velocities in real time. This framework enables real-time online computation of collision-free velocities for any constrained mobile robot, and it exhibits strong robustness to sensor noise. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Visual localization methods often present a trade-off between the high efficiency of specialized approaches, such as scene coordinate regression, and the need for rich, versatile scene representations for broader robotics tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the use of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which enables a unified, photorealistic encoding of 3D geometry and appearance. We propose GSplatLoc, a self-contained framework that tightly integrates structure-based keypoint matching with rendering-based pose refinement. Our two-stage procedure first distills robust descriptors from the lightweight XFeat extractor into the 3DGS model, enabling coarse pose estimation via 2D-3D correspondences without external dependencies. In the second stage, the initial pose is refined by minimizing a photometric warp loss, which leverages the fast, differentiable rendering of 3DGS. Benchmarking on widely used indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among neural rendering-based localization methods and highlights the framework’s robustness in challenging dynamic scenes.

Based on a popular maximum entropy criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of each observation for the partition function based on the current estimate of the cost function parameters, guiding the algorithm towards better estimates in the following iterations. In addition, it does not need a large sample set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments."

Additionally, we present a first investigation and approach for ZKTP that leverages a large language model (LLM) to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and generate behavior trees (BTs) for execution. If errors arise during task execution, the approach also uses an LLM to adjust the BTs on-the-fly in a refinement loop. Experimental validation in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness in improving overall task performance compared to alternative approaches that leverage task-specific knowledge. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to effectively address several aspects of the ZKTP problem, providing a robust framework for automated behavior generation with no task-specific setup."

    "abstract": "Surgical automation requires precise guidance and understanding of the scene. Current methods in the literature rely on bulky depth cameras to create maps of the anatomy; however, this does not translate well to space-limited clinical applications. Monocular cameras are small and allow minimally invasive surgeries in tight spaces, but additional processing is required to generate 3D scene understanding. We propose a 3D mapping pipeline that uses only RGB images to create segmented point clouds of the target anatomy. To ensure the most accurate reconstruction, we compare different structure from motion algorithms’ performance on mapping the central airway obstructions, and test the pipeline on a downstream task of tumor resection. In several metrics, including post-procedure percentage tissue charring, our pipeline performs comparably to RGB-D cameras and, in some cases, even surpasses their downstream task performance. These promising results demonstrate that automation guidance can be achieved in minimally invasive procedures with monocular cameras. This study is a step toward the complete autonomy of surgical robots."

    "abstract": "Catching flying objects with a cushioning process is a skill commonly performed by humans, yet it remains a significant challenge for robots. In this paper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to achieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a high-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the optimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC) planner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as possible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that leverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and positional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to effectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following this, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by the P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences between humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both simulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of 98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in impact torques.

This approach was developed as an improvement over our earlier work, where microcontroller-based control introduced timing drift and required per-channel sample reduction to avoid overlap. The current FPGA-based system resolves these timing issues and ensures high-fidelity capture of per-antenna IQ data for later direction finding or signal processing tasks."

The regularity conditions and the minimum error probability for 2-D wideband ZZB are derived first, along with its closed-form expression. In the asymptotic region with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the derived ZZB approaches the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). In contrast, in the prior performance region with a low SNR, the estimation error is distributed throughout the entire prior parameter space, and thus ZZB depends on the prior covariance matrix. Simulation results indicate that the derived ZZB provides a better performance benchmark than the widely accepted CRB in terms of tightness and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of intelligent manufacturing and the rise of emerging markets, global auto-mobile exports have surged, placing unprecedented demands on logistics infrastructure. Efficient coordination of multiple robots for vehicle autonomous transfer is essential in high-density storage environments. However, conventional navigation mode, where autonomous robots navigate the entire space, often leads to inefficiencies, congestion, and increased safety risks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic network topology framework to optimize large-scale vehicle transfers in high-density environments. The approach models free space as a network graph with directional, weighted movement costs. Leveraging yard operational characteristics, real-time transfer conditions, and robot specific capabilities, we introduce an event-triggered mechanism to update the network topology dynamically. This method continuously refines drivable space, effectively integrating yard areas with roadways to enhance routing flexibility in robot scheduling. Scenario-Based evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces traveled distance by up to 12.3% and task completion time by 19.3% compared to traditional operational networks, leading to lower operational costs and improved task efficiency. Notably, these benefits become more pronounced as the number of robots increases and the operational environment grows more complex."

It takes the T1c, T1n, T2w, and FLAIR modalities obtained from the BraTS 2024 dataset. Each modality is encoded with a separate encoder to retain modality-related information.

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing is an emerging computing paradigm that enhances the computational capabilities of mobile devices by offloading intensive tasks to edge servers. In robotic systems, MEC can significantly reduce response times and improve user experience. However, as robots move through their environments, factors such as the distance to edge servers and physical obstructions fluctuate, leading to variations in communication bandwidth and, consequently, communication delays. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an adaptive computing node offloading framework (ARDF) designed to optimize the dynamic deployment of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) nodes in robot-edge environments. The framework enables developers to flexibly deploy robotic computing tasks based on varying computational and network conditions. We validate its effectiveness through experiments involving robotic arm control, 3D detection applications, and numerically simulated ROS2 tasks under different bandwidth conditions.
