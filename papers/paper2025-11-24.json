    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in robotics and embodied AI is largely driven by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that directly assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across multiple plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose an HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes the complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance."

We replace the usual monotonicity of the coupling term with a weaker, local assumption on the stationary equilibrium (that need not be unique), stemming from a second-order strict positivity condition. This new stability assumption, together with a symmetry property of the system, allows us to derive an exponential turnpike property for those solutions that are close to the stationary one. Finally, through a fixed-point argument, we establish the actual existence of stable solutions, both on the finite horizon $[0,T]$ and on the infinite horizon, provided that the initial (and terminal) data are close enough to the stationary equilibrium."

Capitalizing on this capability, we have developed and deployed a real-time supernova monitoring system for the PandaX-4T experiment.

Multiband $BVR_cI_c$ photometric data were obtained at an observatory in Mexico, from which new times of minima were determined. All target systems also had available space-based TESS time-series data. Orbital period variations were studied for eight target systems, showing either linear or parabolic trends. The target systems exhibiting parabolic trends demonstrated a sustained decrease in their orbital periods over time. We modeled the light curves utilizing the PHOEBE Python code in combination with the BSN application. We revisited the relationship between orbital period and the temperature of the hotter component in contact binary systems using an empirical approach. Our analysis identified a clear break at P=0.27 days, separating the systems into two distinct groups for orbital periods shorter than 0.6 days. Following the determination of stellar extinction, absolute parameters for seven systems were estimated employing parallax measurements from Gaia DR3. Based on the components' effective temperatures and masses, the systems were classified into A- and W-subtypes. Their evolutionary states were illustrated using mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams."

    "abstract": "Group-based policy optimization methods like GRPO and GSPO have become standard for training multimodal models, leveraging group-wise rollouts and relative advantage estimation. However, they suffer from a critical \\emph{gradient vanishing} problem when all responses within a group receive identical rewards, causing advantage estimates to collapse and training signals to diminish. Existing attempts to mitigate this issue fall into two paradigms: filtering-based and sampling-based methods. Filtering-based methods first generate rollouts broadly and then retroactively filter out uninformative groups, leading to substantial computational overhead. Sampling-based methods proactively select effective samples before rollout but rely on static criteria or prior dataset knowledge, lacking real-time adaptability. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{VADE}, a \\textbf{V}ariance-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{D}ynamic sampling framework via online sample-level difficulty \\textbf{E}stimation. Our framework integrates three key components: online sample-level difficulty estimation using Beta distributions, a Thompson sampler that maximizes information gain through the estimated correctness probability, and a two-scale prior decay mechanism that maintains robust estimation under policy evolution. This three components design enables VADE to dynamically select the most informative samples, thereby amplifying training signals while eliminating extra rollout costs. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that VADE consistently outperforms strong baselines in both performance and sample efficiency, while achieving a dramatic reduction in computational overhead. More importantly, our framework can serves as a plug-and-play component to be seamlessly integrated into existing group-based RL algorithms.

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations."

Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide."

    "abstract": "When cooling liquids quickly enough, they bypass crystallization and instead enter a supercooled state and then a glass state. Previous studies have shown that the static structure factors of high-temperature liquids, supercooled liquids, and glasses exhibit only subtle differences, leading to the conclusion that the glass transition cannot be predicted solely from structure factor changes. Our research challenges this view. Specifically, we studied the difficulty of generating configurations corresponding to target structure factors using stochastic gradient descent optimizations. While such optimizations easily converge when targeting the structure factors of higher-temperature liquids, the difficulty significantly increases for lower temperature liquids and glasses. By quantifying this difficulty through the mean squared error achieved, we found a non-differentiable point at the onset temperature of glass dynamics. Our results suggest that the onset of glass dynamics can be explained by a fundamental change in the structure factor's realizability, even though the structure factor itself only changes slightly. Our results are currently based on computer simulations using original and modified Dzugutov interactions, and future work will determine whether our theory is applicable to other glass-forming systems."

Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction."

We present KernelBand, a novel framework that formulates kernel optimization as a hierarchical multi-armed bandit problem, enabling LLM agents to strategically navigate the optimization space by treating kernel selection and optimization strategy application as sequential decision-making processes. Our approach leverages hardware profiling information to identify promising optimization strategies and employs runtime behavior clustering to reduce exploration overhead across kernel candidates. Extensive experiments on TritonBench demonstrate that KernelBand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance with fewer tokens while exhibiting consistent improvement without saturation as computational resources increase."

Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises."

    "abstract": "Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information. Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets. In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area. By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly."

Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%.

To address these issues, we propose FedSTAR, a style-aware federated learning framework that disentangles client-specific style factors from shared content representations. FedSTAR aggregates class-wise prototypes using a Transformer-based attention mechanism, allowing the server to adaptively weight client contributions while preserving personalization. Furthermore, by exchanging compact prototypes and style vectors instead of full model parameters, FedSTAR significantly reduces communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that combining content-style disentanglement with attention-driven prototype aggregation improves personalization and robustness in heterogeneous environments without increasing communication cost."

However, the conventional method uses uniform scale downsampling to build these pyramids, leading to aliasing artifacts that compromise fine details and introduce unwanted jaggies and moiré patterns. To tackle this issue, we present \\textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \\emph{next-scale prediction} to \\emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \\textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \\textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \\textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, and enhances text readability, achieving superior performance with perfect compatibility to existing VAR frameworks."

We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face information overload when handling long contexts, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where extensive supporting documents often introduce redundant content. This issue not only weakens reasoning accuracy but also increases computational overhead. We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression, demonstrating the potential of stable linguistic features in context engineering."

    "abstract": "The scalability of video understanding models is increasingly limited by the prohibitive storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\\% points using only 0.13\\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method. Moreover, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-VL on HMDB51, VideoCompressa matches full-data performance using just 0.41\\% of the training data-outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61\\%."

    "abstract": "Despite being among the most common psychological disorders, anxiety-related conditions are still primarily identified through subjective assessments, such as clinical interviews and self-evaluation questionnaires. These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders"

    "abstract": "Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance."

Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines."

    "abstract": "While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical \"domain shift\" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Decision trees are a popular machine learning model which are traditionally trained by heuristic methods. Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets."

In recent years, hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) have been widely used to capture complex high-order relationships. However, most existing hypergraph neural network methods inherently rely on the homophily assumption, which often does not hold in real-world scenarios that exhibit significant heterophilic structures. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{HONOR}, a novel unsupervised \\textbf{H}ypergraph c\\textbf{ON}trastive learning framework suitable for both hom\\textbf{O}philic and hete\\textbf{R}ophilic hypergraphs. Specifically, HONOR explicitly models the heterophilic relationships between hyperedges and nodes through two complementary mechanisms: a prompt-based hyperedge feature construction strategy that maintains global semantic consistency while suppressing local noise, and an adaptive attention aggregation module that dynamically captures the diverse local contributions of nodes to hyperedges. Combined with high-pass filtering, these designs enable HONOR to fully exploit heterophilic connection patterns, yielding more discriminative and robust node and hyperedge representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate the superior generalization ability and robustness of HONOR. Empirically, extensive experiments further validate that HONOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under both homophilic and heterophilic datasets."

Icy bodies display a remarkable diversity of geological, geophysical, and atmospheric processes, which differ fundamentally from those of the rocky terrestrial planets. Evidence from past and ongoing spacecraft missions has revealed subsurface oceans, cryovolcanic activity, and tenuous but persistent atmospheres, showing that icy bodies are active and evolving worlds. At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies. Their findings, combined with continued Earth- and space-based observations and laboratory studies, will be critical for assessing the potential habitability of these environments and for placing them within a broader framework of planetary system formation and evolution."

    "abstract": "Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs.

Giant planets and brown dwarfs produce large Doppler signatures that are easily detectable by modern instrumentation, and legacy radial velocity (RV) surveys have now achieved full orbital coverage for periods $\\lesssim$30 years. However, the Doppler method's sensitivity to companion minimum mass $M_c \\sin i$ -- as opposed to true mass $M_c$ -- prevents unambiguous characterization using RVs alone, as purported giant planets may be brown dwarfs or stars on inclined orbits. Here we combined legacy RVs with absolute astrometry to re-fit the orbits of 195 companions from the California Legacy Survey. Nearly 50% (8/18) of the ``brown dwarfs\" ($M_c \\sin i$=13--80 $M_{Jup}$) we refit had true masses above 80 $M_{Jup}$. We incorporated our orbital posteriors and target sensitivity maps into a Poisson likelihood model to calculate occurrence as a function of true companion mass $M_c$ (0.8--80 $M_{Jup}$) and separation $a$ (0.3--30 AU). The semi-major axis distributions of objects in this range vary smoothly with mass, with Jupiter analogs favoring an abrupt increase in occurrence near 1 AU and brown dwarfs exhibiting a gradual enhancement at wider separations. Marginalized companion occurrence between 1--10 AU decreases smoothly with mass, with brown dwarfs having the lowest occurrence rate: $0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$%. Jupiter analogs are 10 times as common as brown dwarfs per mass interval in this range, demonstrating that the brown dwarf desert extends to 10 AU. The smooth variation in these distributions disfavors a sharp transition mass between ``bottom-up\" core accretion and ``top-down\" gravitational instability formation mechanisms, and rather suggests that these processes may produce companions in overlapping mass ranges."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of 6G systems demands advanced technologies to boost network capacity and spectral efficiency, particularly in the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Statistical inference from data generated by multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms is challenging due to their adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature. A classical manifestation is that sample averages of arm rewards under bandit sampling may fail to satisfy a central limit theorem. Lai and Wei's stability condition provides a sufficient, and essentially necessary criterion, for asymptotic normality in bandit problems. While the celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm satisfies this stability condition, it is not minimax optimal, raising the question of whether minimax optimality and statistical stability can be achieved simultaneously. In this paper, we analyze the stability properties of a broad class of bandit algorithms that are based on the optimism principle. We establish general structural conditions under which such algorithms violate the Lai-Wei stability criterion. As a consequence, we show that widely used minimax-optimal UCB-style algorithms, including MOSS, Anytime-MOSS, Vanilla-MOSS, ADA-UCB, OC-UCB, KL-MOSS, KL-UCB++, KL-UCB-SWITCH, and Anytime KL-UCB-SWITCH, are unstable. We further complement our theoretical results with numerical simulations demonstrating that, in all these cases, the sample means fail to exhibit asymptotic normality. Overall, our findings suggest a fundamental tension between stability and minimax optimal regret, raising the question of whether it is possible to design bandit algorithms that achieve both. Understanding whether such simultaneously stable and minimax optimal strategies exist remains an important open direction."

Linear stress recovery methods, which solve a single geometrically linear equilibrium problem on the imaged, already-loaded geometry, have been validated for static stress estimation, but their robustness to unknown imaging phase remains unexplored. We investigated whether imaging phase materially biases 99th percentile stress recovered linearly, and whether linear recovery agrees with non-linear analysis under matched loads. Two patient-specific AAAs from a public 4D-CTA cohort (Case 1: 5.5% strain; Case 2: 4.5% strain) were analyzed. For each, we analyzed diastolic and synthetic systolic geometry, the latter generated by warping the diastolic mesh via displacements from non-linear hyperelastic analysis. Linear stresses were recovered on both geometries under systolic pressure and compared via 99th-percentile maximum principal stress, stress distributions, and 3D stress differential contours. Linear stresses under pulse pressure were compared against non-linear stresses. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery on diastolic vs synthetic systolic geometries under systolic pressure differed by 8.6% (Case 1) and 3.5% (Case 2), within segmentation uncertainty. 99th-percentile stresses from linear recovery and non-linear analysis under pulse pressure agreed closely: 0% difference (Case 1) and 1.1% (Case 2), with nearly identical distributions. These findings support linear stress recovery for patient-specific AAA analysis in clinical settings with static single-phase imaging, offering a computationally efficient alternative without compromising accuracy or requiring patient-specific wall properties."

This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection."

Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical \"City-District-Grid\" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a \"produce-refine-evaluate\" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects."

    "abstract": "Information transmitted across modern communication platforms is degraded not only by intentional manipulation (disinformation) but also by intrinsic cognitive decay and topology-dependent social averaging (misinformation). We develop a continuous-fidelity field theory on multiplex networks with distinct layers representing private chats, group interactions, and broadcast channels. Our analytic solutions reveal three universal mechanisms controlling information quality: (i) groupthink blending, where dense group coupling drives fidelity to the initial group mean; (ii) bridge-node bottlenecks, where cross-community flow produces irreversible dilution; and (iii) a network-wide fidelity landscape set by a competition between broadcast truth-injection and structural degradation pathways. These results demonstrate that connectivity can reduce information integrity and establish quantitative control strategies to enhance fidelity in large-scale communication systems."

    "abstract": "Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \\textit{\\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released."

    "abstract": "The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for post-training visual generative models, with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) increasingly used to align generators with human preferences. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation."

    "abstract": "Topological maps are more suitable than metric maps for robotic exploration tasks. However, real-time updating of accurate and detail-rich environmental topological maps remains a challenge. This paper presents a topological map updating method based on the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD). First, the newly observed areas are denoised to avoid low-efficiency GVD nodes misleading the topological structure. Subsequently, a multi-granularity hierarchical GVD generation method is designed to control the sampling granularity at both global and local levels. This not only ensures the accuracy of the topological structure but also enhances the ability to capture detail features, reduces the probability of path backtracking, and ensures no overlap between GVDs through the maintenance of a coverage map, thereby improving GVD utilization efficiency. Second, a node clustering method with connectivity constraints and a connectivity method based on a switching mechanism are designed to avoid the generation of unreachable nodes and erroneous nodes caused by obstacle attraction. A special cache structure is used to store all connectivity information, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Finally, to address the issue of frontiers misjudgment caused by obstacles within the scope of GVD units, a frontiers extraction method based on morphological dilation is designed to effectively ensure the reachability of frontiers. On this basis, a lightweight cost function is used to assess and switch to the next viewpoint in real time. This allows the robot to quickly adjust its strategy when signs of path backtracking appear, thereby escaping the predicament and increasing exploration flexibility. And the performance of system for exploration task is verified through comparative tests with SOTA methods."

However, the utility of the trivial cladding in manipulating topological waves is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate two topologically distinct kagome photonic crystals (KPCs) based on different crystalline symmetries: \\mathbit{C}_\\mathbf{6}- symmetric KPCs exhibit a quantum spin Hall phase, while \\mathbit{C}_\\mathbf{3}-symmetric KPCs serve as trivial cladding. By tuning the geometric parameter of the trivial cladding, we observe that a pair of topological interface states featured with pseudospin-momentum locking undergoes a phase transition, accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of corner states in a finite hexagonal supercell. Such a geometry-induced band inversion is characterized by a sign change in the Dirac mass of the topological interface states and holds potential for applications such as rainbow trapping. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the corner states, which is a hallmark of higher-order topology, also depend critically on the trivial cladding. Our work highlights the crucial role of trivial claddings on the formation of topological boundary states, and offers a novel approach for their manipulation."

We focus on consensus ADMM as a scalable framework for generating collision-free, dynamically feasible motion plans in both trajectory optimization and receding-horizon control settings. In practice, however, these algorithms are sensitive to penalty tuning or adaptation schemes (e.g. residual balancing and adaptive parameter heuristics) that do not explicitly consider delays. To address this, we introduce a Delay-Aware ADMM (DA-ADMM) variant that adapts penalty parameters based on real-time delay statistics, allowing agents to down-weight stale information and prioritize recent updates during consensus and dual updates. Through extensive simulations in 2D and 3D environments with double-integrator, Dubins-car, and drone dynamics, we show that DA-ADMM significantly improves robustness, success rate, and solution quality compared to fixed-parameter, residual-balancing, and fixed-constraint baselines. Our results highlight that performance degradation is not solely determined by delay length or frequency, but by the optimizer's ability to contextually reason over delayed information. The proposed DA-ADMM achieves consistently better coordination performance across a wide range of delay conditions, offering a principled and efficient mechanism for resilient multi-robot motion planning under imperfect communication."

    "abstract": "In crystalline solids, the electronic polarization follows the \\emph{generalized Neumann's principle}, under which all crystallographic point groups can, in principle, support ferroelectric polarization. However, in high-symmetry structures, polarization is constrained by symmetry operations and becomes quantized into discrete values. We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \\emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch. By establishing QP as a fundamental bulk invariant, our work uncovers a universal mechanism governing interfacial electronic phenomena and opens new pathways for the design of functional quantum materials through engineered polarization mismatch."

To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR. Both methods adopt spherical spatial representations to effectively capture fisheye geometry. In light of the lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks, we release Fisheye3DOD, a new open dataset synthesized using CARLA and featuring both standard pinhole and fisheye camera arrays.

This paper aims to determine the multiplier of the PPI strategy to maximise the expected utility of the terminal cushion, where the terminal cushion is penalised proportionally to the realised volatility of stocks issued by firms operating in carbon-intensive sectors. We model the risky assets' dynamics using geometric Brownian motions whose drift rates are modulated by an unobservable common stochastic factor to capture market-specific or economy-wide state variables that are typically not directly observable. Using classical stochastic filtering theory, we formulate a suitable optimization problem and solve it for CRRA utility function. We characterise optimal carbon penalised PPI strategies and optimal value functions under full and partial information and quantify the loss of utility due incomplete information. Finally, we carry a numerical analysis showing that the proposed strategy reduces carbon emission intensity without compromising financial performance."

    "abstract": "A critical barrier to the trustworthiness of sixth-generation (6G) agentic autonomous networks is the uncertainty neglect bias; a cognitive tendency for large language model (LLM)-powered agents to make high-stakes decisions based on simple averages while ignoring the tail risk of extreme events. This paper proposes an unbiased, risk-aware framework for agentic negotiation, designed to ensure robust resource allocation in 6G network slicing. Specifically, agents leverage Digital Twins (DTs) to predict full latency distributions, which are then evaluated using a formal framework from extreme value theory, namely, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). This approach fundamentally shifts the agent's objective from reasoning over the mean to reasoning over the tail, thereby building a statistically-grounded buffer against worst-case outcomes. Furthermore, our framework ensures full uncertainty awareness by requiring agents to quantify epistemic uncertainty -- confidence in their own DTs predictions -- and propagate this meta-verification to make robust decisions, preventing them from acting on unreliable data. We validate this framework in a 6G inter-slice negotiation use-case between an eMBB and a URLLC agent. The results demonstrate the profound failure of the biased, mean-based baseline, which consistently fails its SLAs with a 25\\% rate. Our unbiased, CVaR-aware agent successfully mitigates this bias, eliminating SLA violations and reducing the URLLC and eMBB p99.999 latencies by around 11\\%. We show this reliability comes at the rational and quantifiable cost of slightly reduced energy savings to 17\\%, exposing the false economy of the biased approach. This work provides a concrete methodology for building the trustworthy autonomous systems required for 6G."

Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells."

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation."

In this work, we propose a Value-of-Information aware Low-latency Communication(VIL2C) scheme that proactively adjusts the latency distribution to mitigate its effects in MARL systems. Specifically, we define a Value of Information (VOI) metric to quantify the importance of delayed message transmission based on each delayed message's importance. Moreover, we propose a progressive message reception mechanism to adaptively adjust the reception duration based on received messages. We derive the optimized VoI aware resource allocation and theoretically prove the performance advantage of the proposed VIL2C scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VIL2C outperforms existing approaches under various communication conditions. These gains are attributed to the low-latency transmission of high-VoI messages via resource allocation and the elimination of unnecessary waiting periods via adaptive reception duration."

    "abstract": "The Fermilab Linac experiences longitudinal beam phase drift, leading to increased particle loss, conventionally corrected through labor-intensive manual RF adjustments. This project explores machine learning-based automation for drift correction, employing a prototype-based classification approach. Our model utilizes a 34-dimensional feature set (RF settings and BPM readings) and leverages a 7x27 response matrix for system modeling. To overcome limited real-world data, we generate synthetic data, enhancing model training and generalizability. Custom loss functions, including a surrogate energy-consistent loss and a temporal smoothness constraint, ensure physically plausible drift predictions. The goal is a robust system for autonomous phase adjustments, ensuring stable beam acceleration and reduced manual intervention."

    "abstract": "Small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is a persistent challenge, hindered by low resolution and background clutter. While fusing RGB and infrared (IR) data offers a promising solution, existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency. In this letter, we introduce MambaRefine-YOLO. Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability. Our work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications."

Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection."

    "abstract": "Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction coupled with uncertainty quantification remains a critical challenge in aerospace prognostics. This research introduces a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that learns aleatoric uncertainty directly through probabilistic modeling, an approach unexplored in existing CMAPSS-based literature. Our hierarchical architecture integrates multi-scale Inception blocks for temporal pattern extraction, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks for sequential modeling, and a dual-level attention mechanism operating simultaneously on sensor and temporal dimensions. The innovation lies in the Bayesian output layer that predicts both mean RUL and variance, enabling the model to learn data-inherent uncertainty. Comprehensive preprocessing employs condition-aware clustering, wavelet denoising, and intelligent feature selection. Experimental validation on NASA CMAPSS benchmarks (FD001-FD004) demonstrates competitive overall performance with RMSE values of 16.22, 19.29, 16.84, and 19.98 respectively. Remarkably, our framework achieves breakthrough critical zone performance (RUL <= 30 cycles) with RMSE of 5.14, 6.89, 5.27, and 7.16, representing 25-40 percent improvements over conventional approaches and establishing new benchmarks for safety-critical predictions. The learned uncertainty provides well-calibrated 95 percent confidence intervals with coverage ranging from 93.5 percent to 95.2 percent, enabling risk-aware maintenance scheduling previously unattainable in CMAPSS literature."

    "abstract": "The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

    "abstract": "In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues."

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in large language models and agentic AI are driving the emergence of the Internet of Agents (IoA), a paradigm where billions of autonomous software and embodied agents interact, coordinate, and collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. A key prerequisite for such large-scale collaboration is agent capability discovery, where agents identify, advertise, and match one another's capabilities under dynamic tasks. Agent's capability in IoA is inherently heterogeneous and context-dependent, raising challenges in capability representation, scalable discovery, and long-term performance. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel two-stage capability discovery framework. The first stage, autonomous capability announcement, allows agents to credibly publish machine-interpretable descriptions of their abilities. The second stage, task-driven capability discovery, enables context-aware search, ranking, and composition to locate and assemble suitable agents for specific tasks. Building on this framework, we propose a novel scheme that integrates semantic capability modeling, scalable and updatable indexing, and memory-enhanced continual discovery. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach enhances discovery performance and scalability. Finally, we outline a research roadmap and highlight open problems and promising directions for future IoA."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of IoT devices has led to an enormous amount of sensor data that requires transmission to cloud servers for processing, resulting in excessive network congestion, increased latency and high energy consumption. This is particularly problematic in resource-constrained and remote environments where bandwidth is limited, and battery-dependent devices further emphasize the problem. Moreover, in domains such as agriculture, consecutive sensor readings often have minimal variation, making continuous data transmission inefficient and unnecessarily resource intensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an analytical prediction algorithm designed for edge computing environments and validated through simulation. The proposed solution utilizes a predictive filter at the network edge that forecasts the next sensor data point and triggers data transmission only when the deviation from the predicted value exceeds a predefined tolerance. A complementary cloud-based model ensures data integrity and overall system consistency. This dual-model strategy effectively reduces communication overhead and demonstrates potential for improving energy efficiency by minimizing redundant transmissions. In addition to reducing communication load, our approach leverages both in situ and satellite observations from the same locations to enhance model robustness. It also supports cross-site generalization, enabling models trained in one region to be effectively deployed elsewhere without retraining. This makes our solution highly scalable, energy-aware, and well-suited for optimizing sensor data transmission in remote and bandwidth-constrained IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Collective vigilance describes how animals in groups benefit from the predator detection efforts of others. Empirical observations typically find either a many-eyes strategy with all (or many) group members maintaining a low level of individual vigilance, or a sentinel strategy with one (or a few) individuals maintaining a high level of individual vigilance while others do not. With a general analytical treatment that makes minimal assumptions, we show that these two strategies are alternate solutions to the same adaptive problem of balancing the costs of predation and vigilance. Which strategy is preferred depends on how costs scale with the level of individual vigilance: many-eyes strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise gently at low levels but become steeper at higher levels (convex; e.g. an open field); sentinel strategies are preferred where costs of vigilance rise steeply at low levels and then flatten out (concave; e.g. environments with vantage points). This same dichotomy emerges whether individuals act selfishly to optimise their own fitness or cooperatively to optimise group fitness. The model is extended to explain discrete behavioural switching between strategies and differential levels of vigilance such as edge effects."

However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach."

Significant alterations in these patterns have been observed during our study e.g., in April and May of 2020, the power demand decreased by approximately 15.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. We have used a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to predict the load profile of 2020 excluding COVID-19 effects. This model is compared with the actual load profile to determine the degree to which COVID-19 has impacted. The comparison indicates that the average power demand decreased by approximately 19.5% in April 2020 and 18.3% in May 2020, relative to its projected value. The study also investigates system stability by analyzing transmission loss and load factor, and the environmental effect by analyzing the Carbon Dioxide emission rate.

We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline.

This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$π$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range."

    "abstract": "Message passing graph neural networks are widely used for learning on graphs, yet their expressive power is limited by the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman test and can fail to distinguish structurally different nodes. We provide rigorous theory for a Laplacian positional encoding that is invariant to eigenvector sign flips and to basis rotations within eigenspaces. We prove that this encoding yields node identifiability from a constant number of observations and establishes a sample-complexity separation from architectures constrained by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. The analysis combines a monotone link between shortest-path and diffusion distance, spectral trilateration with a constant set of anchors, and quantitative spectral injectivity with logarithmic embedding size. As an instantiation, pairing this encoding with a neural-process style decoder yields significant gains on a drug-drug interaction task on chemical graphs, improving both the area under the ROC curve and the F1 score and demonstrating the practical benefits of resolving theoretical expressiveness limitations with principled positional information."

    "abstract": "Tunable control of polar landscape in ferroelectrics is crucial for exploring new functionalities in nanoelectronics and materials science. While ferroelectric epitaxial thin films have been studied as transferred membranes on flexible substrates, the degree of control over membrane curvature and local polarization remains limited, being tied to spontaneous fold patterns or uniaxial mechanical deformations. To address this challenge, we introduce a versatile, high-precision optical method for engineering the bending and associated polarization landscapes in ferroelectric membranes. Our approach, based on a photosensitive polymer-assisted patterning technique, enables the creation of on-demand bending strain patterns at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate deterministic 90° and 180° polarization rotations in a ferroelectric BaTiO3 membrane, driven by in-plane strain and flexoelectric effects associated with strain gradients respectively. Such a patterning method is compatible with any oxide membrane, providing a versatile platform for studying strain dependent domain architectures, designing custom ferroelectric landscapes, and investigating flexoelectric behavior with unprecedented control capabilities."

Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \\underline{l}ayer\\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \\underline{f}eature d\\underline{e}coupling, termed \\textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \\href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\\texttt{Life-IQA}}."

    "abstract": "Preference learning has recently emerged as a pivotal strategy for post-training alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly rely on external human-annotated preference data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. In this work, we propose OrdMoE, a novel preference alignment framework that bypasses the reliance on external human preferences entirely by leveraging intrinsic signals within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. Specifically, we observe that the router's expert selection scores implicitly encode a quality-aware ranking of responses (i.e. higher-scoring experts consistently generate higher-quality outputs). Building on this insight, OrdMoE constructs an internal preference hierarchy by grouping experts into ranked tiers based on their per-token routing scores and activating each tier separately to produce a sequence of responses with increasing quality. This yields a zero-cost, self-supervised preference ordering over generated responses, which can be directly optimized using standard preference learning objectives. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demnstrate that OrdMoE significantly enhances both alignment and overall performance of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, achieving competitive results without requiring any human-annotated preference data."

    "abstract": "This study uses a Design-Based Research (DBR) cycle to refine the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high school programming education. The initial problem was identified in an Intervention Group where, in an unguided setting, a higher proportion of executive, solution-seeking queries correlated strongly and negatively with exam performance. A contemporaneous Comparison Group demonstrated that without guidance, these unproductive help-seeking patterns do not self-correct, with engagement fluctuating and eventually declining. This insight prompted a mid-course pedagogical intervention in the first group, designed to teach instrumental help-seeking. The subsequent evaluation confirmed the intervention's success, revealing a decrease in executive queries, as well as a shift toward more productive learning workflows. However, this behavioral change did not translate into a statistically significant improvement in exam grades, suggesting that altering tool-use strategies alone may be insufficient to overcome foundational knowledge gaps. The DBR process thus yields a more nuanced principle: the educational value of an LLM depends on a pedagogy that scaffolds help-seeking, but this is only one part of the complex process of learning."

We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest."

Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations.

To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned representation of the teacher's full generative capabilities. This leads us to question whether this reliance on data is truly necessary for successful flow map distillation. In this work, we explore a data-free alternative that samples only from the prior distribution, a distribution the teacher is guaranteed to follow by construction, thereby circumventing the mismatch risk entirely. To demonstrate the practical viability of this philosophy, we introduce a principled framework that learns to predict the teacher's sampling path while actively correcting for its own compounding errors to ensure high fidelity. Our approach surpasses all data-based counterparts and establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin. Specifically, distilling from SiT-XL/2+REPA, our method reaches an impressive FID of 1.45 on ImageNet 256x256, and 1.49 on ImageNet 512x512, both with only 1 sampling step. We hope our work establishes a more robust paradigm for accelerating generative models and motivates the broader adoption of flow map distillation without data."

HBEST models log power spectra using a truncated cosine basis expansion with a novel global-local coefficient decomposition, enabling simultaneous estimation of population-level and individual-level power spectra and accommodating time series of varying lengths. The fully Bayesian framework provides shrinkage priors for regularized estimation and efficient information sharing. Simulations demonstrate HBEST's advantages over competing methods in computational efficiency and estimation accuracy.

Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation is analyzed via Hörmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane, reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow. The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations. Explicit formulas are given in a form suitable for numerical computation and visualization of phase-space dynamics."

Here the version the Staruszkiewicz model is presented to describe the relativistic system of two massless charged particles interacting as follows: the retarded field of the first particle acts on the second particle, the advanced field of the second particle acts on the first particle, and a radiation reaction is neglected. The model is formulated within the Hamiltonian formalism with constraints. The system is invariant with respect to 15-parametric conformal group. The corresponding conserved canonical generators and the relativistic Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector provide a superintegrability of the system.

By implementing both frameworks on a shared Time-Conditioned U-Net backbone using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that Flow Matching significantly outperforms Diffusion in efficiency. Our geometric analysis reveals that Flow Matching learns a highly rectified transport path (Curvature $\\mathcal{C} \\approx 1.02$), which is near-optimal, whereas Diffusion trajectories remain stochastic and tortuous ($\\mathcal{C} \\approx 3.45$). Furthermore, we establish an ``efficiency frontier'' at $N=10$ function evaluations, where Flow Matching retains high fidelity while Diffusion collapses. Finally, we show via numerical sensitivity analysis that the learned vector field is sufficiently linear to render high-order ODE solvers (Runge-Kutta 4) unnecessary, validating the use of lightweight Euler solvers for edge deployment. \\textbf{This work concludes that Flow Matching is the superior algorithmic choice for real-time, resource-constrained generative tasks.}"

It then employs a branch-and-bound (BB) search to eliminate operations out of PEs, ensuring that the input DFGs successfully map onto the resulting CGRAs, eventually returning an optimized heterogeneous CGRA. Experimental evaluation with 12 DFGs and 9 target CGRA sizes reveals that the framework reduces the number of operations by 68.7% on average, resulting in a reduction of CGRA area by almost 70% and of power by over 51%, all compared to the initial full layout. HeLEx generates CGRAs that are on average only within 6.2% of theoretically minimum CGRAs that support exactly the number of operations needed by the input DFGs.

We compare the impact of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss LLMs in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency."

    "abstract": "A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline."

The aim is to develop distributed protocols enabling nonfaulty/normal followers to accurately track a dynamic/time-varying reference value of the leader while they may receive misinformation from adversarial neighbors. Our methodologies employ the mean subsequence reduced algorithm with agents engaging with neighbors using multi-hop communication. We accordingly derive a necessary and sufficient graph condition for our algorithms to succeed; also, our tracking error bounds are smaller than that of the existing method. Furthermore, it is emphasized that even when agents do not use relays, our condition is tighter than the sufficient conditions in the literature. With multi-hop relays, we can further obtain more relaxed graph requirements. Finally, we present numerical examples to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation."

    "abstract": "Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages."

Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency."

Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency."

    "abstract": "Characterizing topological phases for strongly interacting fermions in the mixed-state regime remains a major challenge. Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles."

    "abstract": "Coherent crystalline interfaces form when a pair of joined crystals share lattice sites. Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids."

This mechanism has only one degree of freedom (DoF) and thus makes for efficient and reliable deployment without loss of structural integrity. It employed a systematic design approach starting from a triple scissors links modular unit to a 25m aperture assembly. Different configurations constituting variable numbers of modular units were analyzed in SolidWorks to identify the deployable mechanism with lowest deformation. While the 24 units configuration offered superior stowage compactness, it exhibited higher deformation (0.01437mm), confirming the 12 units configuration as the optimal balance between structural stability and deployment efficiency. Screw theory was employed to analyze the kinematic properties, and numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB and SolidWorks. The deployable space antenna showed transition from stowed to fully deployed state in just 53 seconds with high stability throughout the deployment process. The TSDAM attained a storage ratio of up to 15.3 for height and volume with 0.01048mm of deformation for a 12 units configuration. Mesh convergence analysis proved the consistency of the simulation results for 415314 tetrahedral shaped elements. The virtual experiments in SolidWorks verified the analytical Screw theory based model and ensured that the design was smooth and flexible for deployment in operational conditions. The research establishes a robust design framework for future deployable antennas, offering enhanced performance, simplified structure, and improved reliability"

    "abstract": "We investigate the Two-Stream Instability in a strongly coupled plasma using classical molecular dynamics simulations with long-range Coulomb interactions between particles. The nonlinear evolution of the instability is identified by the emergence of a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) mode. Our simulations capture key microscopic effects, such as inter-particle correlations, collisional dynamics, and coherent wave-particle interactions-features often absent in traditional fluid and kinetic models, including Particle-In-Cell and Vlasov approaches. In the linear regime, the instability grows rapidly and saturates within a few tens of plasma periods. As the system transitions into the nonlinear saturation phase, a single BGK mode emerges. This mode (or phase-space hole) becomes dynamically unstable in the nonlinear regime, characterized by a continuous decay of electrostatic energy over time. An energy budget analysis reveals a bump in an otherwise thermal spectrum, indicating the excitation of a coherent mode, further confirmed through a numerical rendering of the dispersion relation. The pairwise interaction plays a crucial role: pronounced instability and BGK mode formation occur with long-range Coulomb forces, while such structures are suppressed under shielded Coulomb interactions. We observe the emergence of a single BGK mode across all coupling strengths in the fluid regime, provided the streaming velocity exceeds a critical threshold."

    "abstract": "Perovskite solar cells are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. However, their performance as multi-scale devices is determined by complex interactions between their constituent layers. This creates a vast combinatorial space of possible materials and device architectures, making the conventional experimental-based screening process slow and expensive. Machine learning models try to address this problem, but they only focus on individual material properties or neglect the important geometric information of the perovskite crystal. To address this problem, we propose to predict perovskite solar cell power conversion efficiency with a geometric-aware co-attention (Solar-GECO) model. Solar-GECO combines a geometric graph neural network (GNN) - that directly encodes the atomic structure of the perovskite absorber - with language model embeddings that process the textual strings representing the chemical compounds of the transport layers and other device components. Solar-GECO also integrates a co-attention module to capture intra-layer dependencies and inter-layer interactions, while a probabilistic regression head predicts both power conversion efficiency (PCE) and its associated uncertainty. Solar-GECO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming several baselines, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) for PCE prediction from 3.066 to 2.936 compared to semantic GNN (the previous state-of-the-art model). Solar-GECO demonstrates that integrating geometric and textual information provides a more powerful and accurate framework for PCE prediction."

Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response."

To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions.

To assess feasibility, we constructed a sample of 650 white dwarf candidates identified within PLATOs Southern LOPS2 field using the PLATO complementary science catalogue combined with Gaia DR3, and derived atmospheric parameters through photometric modeling. This sample comprises 118 DA white dwarfs (including 23 ZZ Ceti candidates), and 41 non-DAs (including 35 DBV candidates). Simulated observations using PlatoSim demonstrate that PLATO will be capable of detecting white dwarf pulsation modes with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mma depending on stellar magnitude, observation duration, pixel location, and the number of contributing cameras. We provide detailed detection limits and visibility forecasts for known pulsators across a representative range of these parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize strong synergies with Gaia astrometry, TESS photometry, and targeted spectroscopic campaigns, which together will enable robust mode identification and detailed stellar modeling. Collectively, these efforts will unlock unprecedented insights into white dwarf origins, evolution and internal physics, and the fate of their planetary systems."

In this paper, we propose an efficient controller for trajectory tracking of marine vehicles under unknown disturbances by combining a convex error-state MPC on the Lie group with an online learning module to compensate for these disturbances in real time. This design enables adaptive and robust control while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations in numerical simulations, the Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulator, and real-world field experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior tracking accuracy under various disturbance scenarios compared with existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications."

    "abstract": "We present a topology-informed inverse rendering approach for reconstructing high-genus surface meshes from multi-view images. Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces."

    "abstract": "Neural representations for 3D meshes are emerging as an effective solution for compact storage and efficient processing. Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD)."

To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions."

Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., \"look at the ball\" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment."

We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound."

This power law appears to hold despite the fact that neither the density $ρ(r)$ nor velocity dispersion $σ(r)$ follow universal power law relations individually, even at fixed mass. We analyze 246 host halos from the Symphony suite of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations, to consistently measure PPSD profiles across host masses from $10^{11}$ to $10^{15} M_\\odot$. We find that the PPSD systematically deviates from a power law, and that halos with larger deviations from Jeans equilibrium systematically develop steeper average PPSD slopes. This result suggests that the PPSD is not universal; instead, it is linked to a halo's degree of dynamical equilibrium, which is ultimately set by halo formation history. As a result, we show that secondary halo properties such as concentration and accretion rate inherit significant correlations with the PPSD slope. Moreover, our hosts' PPSD profiles are remarkably consistent with predictions from 1D self-similar fluid collapse models, indicating that three-dimensional structure, velocity anisotropy, and cosmological environment all play negligible roles in shaping the PPSD. These findings imply that the PPSD does not follow a universal power law, but is instead determined by halo mass assembly history alone."

For many average-case problems, there does not currently exist strong evidence via reductions that they are hard. However, we can still attempt to predict their polynomial time tractability by proving lower bounds against restricted classes of algorithms. Geometric approaches to predicting tractability typically study the \\emph{optimization landscape}. For optimization problems with random objectives or constraints, ideas originating in statistical physics suggest we should study the \\emph{overlap} between approximately-optimal solutions. Formally, properties of \\emph{Gibbs measures} and the \\emph{Franz--Parisi potential} imply lower bounds against natural local search algorithms, such as Langevin dynamics. A related theory, the \\emph{Overlap Gap Property (OGP)}, proves rigorous lower bounds against classes of algorithms which are stable functions of their input. A remarkable recent work of Li and Schramm showed that the shortest path problem in random graphs admits lower bounds against a class of stable algorithms, via the OGP. Yet this problem is polynomial time tractable. We further investigate this. We find that both the OGP and the Franz--Parisi potential predict that: (1) local search will fail in the optimization landscape of shortest paths, but (2) local search should succeed in the optimization landscape for shortest path \\emph{trees}, which is true. Using the Franz--Parisi potential, we explain an analogy with results from combinatorial optimization -- submodular minimization is tractable via local search on the Lovász extension, even though ``naive'' local search over sets or the multilinear extension provably fails."

We applied this approach to a series of newly designed carbazole-based prototypical organic dyes, doping the bridge at positions 1, 2, and 3 with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to generate mono-, di-, and tri-doped variants. Our results demonstrate a clear and progressive enhancement in charge transfer as the degree of nitrogen or oxygen doping increases from mono- to di- to tri-doped systems. For mono-doped dyes, the highest forward charge transfer from donor to bridge to acceptor (D$\\xrightarrow{}$B$\\xrightarrow{}$A) occurs when a heteroatom (N or O) is placed in the terminal ring of the bridge, closer to the acceptor. In di-doped dyes, the largest forward charge transfer is observed when heteroatoms occupy both terminal positions, with one atom (N or S) adjacent to the donor and the other (N) near the acceptor. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the organic dye doped with three nitrogen atoms at the bridge exhibits the most efficient and highest directional donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (42.6\\%), making it the most promising candidate for potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, our calculations predict weak charge separation in all systems, indicating that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor."

Ejection of CEs leads to tightened stellar orbits capable of forming compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. As these mergers are seen by gravitational-wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK), we ask what the merger rates of compact binaries in LVK tell us about the fraction of LRNe that lead to the formation of compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Using the observed volumetric rates of LRNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and of compact binary mergers from LVK observations, we derive limits on the fraction of LRNe that produce compact binaries that merge in Hubble time. Assuming the LRNe rate closely follows the star formation rate at any redshift, we use the delay time distribution models for compact binaries to compute the compact binary merger rate. A comparison of this merger rate with the latest volumetric rates of compact binary mergers from the fourth GW transient catalog (GWTC-4) at the present epoch of LVK allows us to constrain the above fraction. We find that only a fraction as small as $\\sim 10^{-3}$ (median) of the LRNe correspond to the GW-observed binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers. This potentially implies that the majority of the LRNe population will not lead to mergers of compact objects, but other end products, such as stellar mergers."

For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler.

However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks.

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume.

In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the Lévy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a Lévy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework."

    "abstract": "This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature. In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions."

Specifically, a neural network (NN) is used to learn the mapping from problem parameters to optimal integer solutions, while a differentiable QP layer is integrated to compute the corresponding continuous variables given the predicted integers and problem parameters. Moreover, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which combines a supervised loss with respect to the global optimal solution, and a self-supervised loss derived from the problem's objective and constraints.

A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new class of error-correcting codes constructed from the ideal lattices of finite commutative ternary Gamma-semirings (TGS). Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks. A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method. These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems."

We develop an optimization framework to maximize task offloading admission rate while balancing the energy consumption and delay requirements. Accounting for satellite visibility and limited computing resources, our approach integrates dynamic path selection with frequency and computational resource allocation. Because the formulated problem is NP-hard, we reformulate it into a mixed-integer convex form using disjunctive constraints and convex relaxation techniques, enabling efficient use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Simulation results show that, compared to a standalone LEO network, the proposed hybrid LEO-MEO architecture improves the task admission rate by 15\\% and reduces the average delay by 12\\%.

While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods."

    "abstract": "Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo."

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) represent a novel approach that enables flexible adjustments to antenna positions, effectively altering the channel environment and thereby enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. However, conventional MA implementations often adopt fully digital beamforming (FDB), which requires a dedicated RF chain for each antenna. This requirement significantly increase hardware costs, making such systems impractical for multi-antenna deployments. To address this, hardware-efficient analog beamforming (AB) offers a cost-effective alternative. This paper investigates the physical layer security (PLS) in an MA-enabled multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system with an emphasis on AB. In this scenario, an MA-enabled transmitter with AB broadcasts common confidential information to a group of legitimate receivers, while a number of eavesdroppers overhear the transmission and attempt to intercept the information. Our objective is to maximize the multicast secrecy rate (MSR) by jointly optimizing the phase shifts of the AB and the positions of the MAs, subject to constraints on the movement area of the MAs and the constant modulus (CM) property of the analog phase shifters. This MSR maximization problem is highly challenging, as we have formally proven it to be NP-hard. To solve it efficiently, we propose a penalty constrained product manifold (PCPM) framework. Specifically, we first reformulate the position constraints as a penalty function, enabling unconstrained optimization on a product manifold space (PMS), and then propose a parallel conjugate gradient descent algorithm to efficiently update the variables. Simulation results demonstrate that MA-enabled systems with AB can achieve a well-balanced performance in terms of MSR and hardware costs."

    "abstract": "Conformal Prediction (CP) has emerged as a powerful statistical framework for high-stakes classification applications. Instead of predicting a single class, CP generates a prediction set, guaranteed to include the true label with a pre-specified probability. The performance of different CP methods is typically assessed by their average prediction set size. In setups where the classes can be partitioned into semantic groups, e.g., diseases that require similar treatment, users can benefit from prediction sets that are not only small on average, but also contain a small number of semantically different groups. This paper begins by addressing this problem and ultimately offers a widely applicable tool for boosting any CP method on any dataset. First, given a class partition, we propose augmenting the CP score function with a term that penalizes predictions with out-of-group errors. We theoretically analyze this strategy and prove its advantages for group-related metrics. Surprisingly, we show mathematically that, for common class partitions, it can also reduce the average set size of any CP score function. Our analysis reveals the class similarity factors behind this improvement and motivates us to propose a model-specific variant, which does not require any human semantic partition and can further reduce the prediction set size. Finally, we present an extensive empirical study, encompassing prominent CP methods, multiple models, and several datasets, which demonstrates that our class-similarity-based approach consistently enhances CP methods."

Previous work and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automating the generation of reward functions. However, existing methodologies often require preliminary evaluation metrics, human-engineered feedback for the refinement process, or the use of environmental source code as context. To address these limitations, this paper introduces LEARN-Opt (LLM-based Evaluator and Analyzer for Reward functioN Optimization). This LLM-based, fully autonomous, and model-agnostic framework eliminates the need for preliminary metrics and environmental source code as context to generate, execute, and evaluate reward function candidates from textual descriptions of systems and task objectives. LEARN-Opt's main contribution lies in its ability to autonomously derive performance metrics directly from the system description and the task objective, enabling unsupervised evaluation and selection of reward functions. Our experiments indicate that LEARN-Opt achieves performance comparable to or better to that of state-of-the-art methods, such as EUREKA, while requiring less prior knowledge. We find that automated reward design is a high-variance problem, where the average-case candidate fails, requiring a multi-run approach to find the best candidates. Finally, we show that LEARN-Opt can unlock the potential of low-cost LLMs to find high-performing candidates that are comparable to, or even better than, those of larger models. This demonstrated performance affirms its potential to generate high-quality reward functions without requiring any preliminary human-defined metrics, thereby reducing engineering overhead and enhancing generalizability."

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance."

Traditional team aggregation methods, such as voting, are susceptible to these AI errors, which can actively bias the behaviour of each individual and inflate the likelihood of an erroneous group decision. We hypothesised that a collaborative Brain-Computer Interface (cBCI) using neural activity collected before a behavioural decision is made can provide a source of information that is decoupled from this biased behaviour, thereby protecting the team from the deleterious influence of AI error. We tested this in a VR drone surveillance task where teams of operators faced high workload and systematically misleading AI cues, comparing traditional behaviour-based team strategies against a purely Neuro-Decoupled Team (NDT) that used only BCI confidence scores derived from pre-response EEG. Under AI deception, behaviour-based teams catastrophically failed, with Majority Vote accuracy collapsing to 44%. The NDT, however, maintained 98% accuracy, a statistically significant synergistic gain over even the team's best individual performer (p < .001). This was explained by a neuro-behavioural decoupling, where the BCI's predictions remained highly accurate while the operator's subjective confidence became an unreliable signal. We conclude that an implicit BCI provides resilience by learning to adapt its neural strategy, shifting from relying on signals of efficient, autopilot processing in simple conditions to interpreting signatures of effortful deliberation when confronted with cognitive conflict. This demonstrates a system that leverages the context of the neural signal to defend against AI-induced error in high-stakes environments."

To address this challenge, an ultrasonic flow meter was designed and developed, capable of simultaneously measuring both flow velocity and fluid level. To improve measurement accuracy, a flow profile correction factor (FPCF) was derived based on the velocity distribution characteristics and applied to the raw flow meter output. A dedicated open-channel flow loop incorporating a 250 mm diameter pipe was constructed to test and calibrate the system under controlled conditions. Flow rates in the loop varied from 2 to 6 liters per second. The accuracy of the flow meter was evaluated using the Flow-Weighted Mean Error (FWME) metric. Experimental results showed that applying the FPCF significantly improved accuracy, reducing the maximum flow measurement error from 8.51% to 2.44%. Furthermore, calibration led to a substantial decrease in FWME from 1.78% to 0.08%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The flow meter was also subjected to clogging scenarios by artificially obstructing the flow. Under these conditions, the device was able to reliably measure the flow and successfully detected the clogging, triggering an alarm to the operator to take necessary action."

    "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental challenge for understanding how information, influence, and contagion propagate through interconnected systems. Conventional centrality measures, particularly gravity-based models, often depend on pairwise interaction forces and a fixed radius of influence, which oversimplify the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of real networks. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel non-interactive, action-based model, termed Yukawa Potential Centrality (YPC), which adapts the physical Yukawa potential to the topology of complex networks. Unlike gravity models, YPC computes a scalar potential for each node rather than pairwise forces, dynamically adjusting its radius of influence according to local structural properties. This formulation establishes a physically interpretable bridge between potential theory and network science, while significantly reducing computational complexity, from quadratic to near-linear time. The model is evaluated across both synthetic and real-world social networks, and its node rankings are compared with classical centrality indices and epidemic spreading models (SI and SIS). Experimental findings reveal that YPC exhibits a strong positive correlation with the SIS model and effectively isolates key spreaders, even within highly irregular topologies. These results demonstrate that YPC provides a scalable, adaptive, and theoretically grounded framework for influence analysis in social, biological, and communication networks."

For a pointed Hopf algebra $H$ over $k$, we construct a well-ordered set $X$ such that: (1) $H$ is generated, as an algebra, by the subset $X_I$ of irreducible letters (with respect to the reduction order); and (2) $X_I$ is finite whenever $H$ is right Noetherian."

While neutral two-particle excitations (excitons) have been observed in tr-ARPES, signatures of trions -- three-quasiparticle bound states -- have only been probed via optical spectroscopy. Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics."

This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences."

With the growing presence of AI in society, it becomes increasingly important to develop methods that can explain and interpret the decisions made by these systems. To address this, mechanistic interpretability (MI) emerged as a promising and distinctive research program within the broader field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). MI is the process of studying the inner computations of neural networks and translating them into human-understandable algorithms. It encompasses reverse engineering techniques aimed at uncovering the computational algorithms implemented by neural networks. In this article, we propose a unified taxonomy of MI approaches and provide a detailed analysis of key techniques, illustrated with concrete examples and pseudo-code. We contextualize MI within the broader interpretability landscape, comparing its goals, methods, and insights to other strands of XAI. Additionally, we trace the development of MI as a research area, highlighting its conceptual roots and the accelerating pace of recent work. We argue that MI holds significant potential to support a more scientific understanding of machine learning systems -- treating models not only as tools for solving tasks, but also as systems to be studied and understood. We hope to invite new researchers into the field of mechanistic interpretability."

Individuals are either ignorants, spreaders, or stiflers; spreaders stop by contact with other spreaders or stiflers or after an independent random waiting time sampled from a given distribution, modeling a spontaneous loss of interest. The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states. The mean-field limit is described by a system of nonlinear integral equations, while fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian and governed by a system of stochastic integral equations with explicit covariance. Our results show how the topology and the law of spontaneous stifling jointly shape the speed and variability of rumor outbreaks. As a special case, our model reduces to the classical Maki-Thompson model when spontaneous stifling is absent."

Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes."

    "abstract": "Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces two major design bottlenecks: crafting dense reward functions and constructing curricula that avoid local optima in high-dimensional, non-stationary environments. Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training."

The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect."

We propose local entropy search (LES), a Bayesian optimization paradigm that explicitly targets the solutions reachable by the descent sequences of iterative optimizers. The algorithm propagates the posterior belief over the objective through the optimizer, resulting in a probability distribution over descent sequences. It then selects the next evaluation by maximizing mutual information with that distribution, using a combination of analytic entropy calculations and Monte-Carlo sampling of descent sequences. Empirical results on high-complexity synthetic objectives and benchmark problems show that LES achieves strong sample efficiency compared to existing local and global Bayesian optimization methods."

More broadly, feature engineering encompasses a wider set of practices aimed at enhancing predictive performance, and is typically performed as part of a data pre-processing step. In contrast, this paper integrates a substantial component of the feature engineering process directly into the modelling stage. This is achieved by introducing a novel general framework for embedding interpretable covariate transformations within multi-parameter Generalised Additive Models (GAMs). Our framework accommodates any sufficiently differentiable scalar-valued transformation of potentially high-dimensional and complex covariates. These transformations are treated as integral model components, with their parameters estimated jointly with regression coefficients via maximum a posteriori (MAP) methods, and joint uncertainty quantified via approximate Bayesian techniques. Smoothing parameters are selected in an empirical Bayes framework using a Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood, supported by efficient computation based on implicit differentiation methods. We demonstrate the flexibility and practical value of the proposed methodology through applications to forecasting electricity net-demand in Great Britain and to modelling house prices in London. The proposed methods are implemented by the gamFactory R package, available at https://github.com/mfasiolo/gamFactory."

In contrast, this work iteratively prunes the constraint set to synthesize an invariant set -- eliminating the need for a known, initial invariant set. Furthermore, we provide stability assurances by characterizing the asymptotic stability of the system relative to an invariant approximation of the minimal positive invariant set through synthesis of a discontinuous piecewise affine Lyapunov function over the computed invariant set.

    "abstract": "Sunspots depict large variability during the last 100 years, a period called the Modern Maximum (MM). However, other variables are needed to study the long-term evolution, e.g., of weaker fields and different radiative emissions. Recently, the relation between sunspots and the F10.7 and F30 radio fluxes and the MgII index (proxies of EUV irradiance) was found to vary during the last 70 years so that a relative sunspot dominance over EUV in the 1950s-1960s changed to EUV dominance in the 2000s (Mursula et al., 2024). Here we use data from eight long-operating observatories to calculate the yearly range of daily variation of the geomagnetic Y-component, the rY index, for the last 137 years. The rY index correlates very well with the MgII index and the solar F30 radio flux. These three indices have no trend relative to each other. On the other hand, the F10.7 flux has a significant trend with respect to the three co-varying EUV indices (MgII, F30, rY). Therefore, the rY index replaces F10.7 as the best long-term EUV proxy, and extends the MgII index by 90 years. We verify that all the four EUV proxies (rY, MgII, F30, F10.7) have an increasing trend with respect to sunspots during the last 50-70 years. This is valid both for sunspot numbers and group numbers. We find that the relation between rY index and sunspots has a quadratic evolution over the MM. The Sun has more sunspots relative to EUV irradiance during the growth and maximum of the MM, while the opposite is true during its decay. We estimate that the MgII index increases by 24\\% of its solar cycle variation with respect to the sunspot number during the last 70 years. Our results indicate a systematic difference in the evolution between sunspots (photosphere) and plages (chromosphere) with long-term solar activity. The implied varying spot-facula ratio has consequences to the stellar evolution of the Sun and Sun-like stars."

Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization."

Such states do not exist in the parallel Josephson junction array which is described by the standard discrete sine-Gordon equation. It is shown that there are compact fluxon and multi-fluxon states which either satisfy the top-bottom antisymmetry or are asymmetric. The anti-symmetric states have zero energy if their topological charge is even and the asymmetric states always have zero energy. Depending on the anisotropy constant the compact fluxons can either coexist with the non-compact states or only compact states are possible. External magnetic field prevents compact state existence."

    "abstract": "Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians."

    "abstract": "Neutron transport inside the reflector tank of the new Brazilian nuclear reactor, called the RMB (Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor), is investigated using the stochastic Monte Carlo method. One of the main characteristics of research nuclear reactors is the core power density, which is proportional to the neutron flux generated in the fission reaction. The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 Å to 1.19 Å. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $λ_{peak}$ = 1.18 Å increasing to $λ_{peak}$ = 1.21 Å."

Here, we consider the power of a measurement of $E_G$ using galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering with sources from the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We first update the theoretical framework for the covariance of $E_G$ to accommodate this Stage IV scenario. We then demonstrate that $E_G$ offers in principle a model-agnostic test of gravity using only linear-scale information, with the caveat that a careful treatment of galaxy bias is required. We finally address the persistent issue of $E_G$'s theoretical dependence on the measured value of $Ω_{\\rm M}^0$. We propose a framework that takes advantage of the posterior predictive test to consistently incorporate uncertainty on $Ω_{\\rm M}^0$ in tests of gravity with $E_G$, which should be of general use beyond the LSST+DESI scenario. Our forecasting study using this method shows that the prior information available for $Ω_{\\rm M}^0$ is instrumental in determining the power of $E_G$ in the LSST+DESI context. For the full survey dataset, with priors on $Ω_{\\rm M}^0$ from existing CMB data, we find that for some modified gravity scenarios considered, we are likely to be able to reject the GR null hypothesis."

In this work, we propose AvatarBrush, a framework that reconstructs fully animatable and locally editable avatars using only a monocular video input. We propose a three-layer model to represent the avatar and, inspired by mesh morphing techniques, design a framework to generate the Gaussian model from local information of the parametric body model. Compared to previous methods that require scanned meshes or multi-view captures as input, our approach reduces costs and enhances editing capabilities such as body shape adjustment, local texture modification, and geometry transfer. Our experimental results demonstrate superior quality across two datasets and emphasize the enhanced, user-friendly, and localized editing capabilities of our method."

On this basis, we develop an efficient algorithm to enumerate autocatalytic subnetworks and, as a special case, autocatalytic cores, i.e., minimal autocatalytic subnetworks, in full-size metabolic networks. The same algorithmic approach can also be used to determine autocatalytic cores only. As a showcase application, we provide a complete analysis of autocatalysis in the core metabolism of E. coli and enumerate irreducible autocatalytic subsystems of limited size in full-fledged metabolic networks of E. coli, human erythrocytes, and Methanosarcina barkeri (Archea).

While prior electroencephalogram (EEG) guided reinforcement learning studies have primarily focused on navigation or low-dimensional locomotion tasks, we aim to understand whether such neural evaluative signals can improve policy learning in high-dimensional manipulation tasks involving obstacles and precise end-effector control. We integrate error related potentials decoded from offline-trained EEG classifiers into reward shaping and systematically evaluate the impact of human-feedback weighting. Experiments on a 7-DoF manipulator in an obstacle-rich reaching environment show that neural feedback accelerates reinforcement learning and, depending on the human-feedback weighting, can yield task success rates that at times exceed those of sparse-reward baselines. Moreover, when applying the best-performing feedback weighting across all sub jects, we observe consistent acceleration of reinforcement learning relative to the sparse-reward setting. Furthermore, leave-one subject-out evaluations confirm that the proposed framework remains robust despite the intrinsic inter-individual variability in EEG decodability. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based reinforcement learning can scale beyond locomotion tasks and provide a viable pathway for human-aligned manipulation skill acquisition."

In this work, we challenge that perspective by showing that differential privacy can be integrated into a fairness-enhancing pipeline with minimal impact on fairness guarantees. We design a postprocessing algorithm, called DP2DP, that enforces both demographic parity and differential privacy. Our analysis reveals that our algorithm converges towards its demographic parity objective at essentially the same rate (up logarithmic factor) as the best non-private methods from the literature. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm our theoretical results, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness/privacy trade-offs."

    "abstract": "Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\\% higher inference speed and 53.4\\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities."

Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene.

Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we uncover strongly coupled spin, lattice, and orbital excitations. By varying the temperature, we identify the phonon-CFE coupling strength scales as sqrt(N), where N represents the effective ground-state population, which is a hallmark of Dicke cooperativity. Our findings verified the cooperative nature of the interaction between local Jahn-Teller ions and long-range phonons, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic and vibrational properties of materials through population control."

    "abstract": "Recently, fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained GNNs has yielded remarkable attention in adapting pre-trained GNN models for downstream graph learning tasks. One representative fine-tuning method is to exploit adapter (termed AdapterGNN) which aims to 'augment' the pre-trained model by inserting a lightweight module to make the 'augmented' model better adapt to the downstream tasks. However, graph data may contain various types of noise in downstream tasks, such as noisy edges and ambiguous node attributes. Existing AdapterGNNs are often prone to graph noise and exhibit limited generalizability. How to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of GNNs' fine tuning remains an open problem. In this paper, we show that the above problem can be well addressed by integrating uncertainty learning into the GNN adapter. We propose the Uncertainty-aware Adapter (UAdapterGNN) that fortifies pre-trained GNN models against noisy graph data in the fine-tuning process. Specifically, in contrast to regular AdapterGNN, our UAdapterGNN exploits Gaussian probabilistic adapter to augment the pre-trained GNN model. In this way, when the graph contains various noises,our method can automatically absorb the effects of changes in the variances of the Gaussian distribution, thereby significantly enhancing the model's robustness. Also, UAdapterGNN can further improve the generalization ability of the model on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and high generalization ability of the proposed UAdapterGNN method."

    "abstract": "Accurate proprioceptive odometry is fundamental for legged robot navigation in GPS-denied and visually degraded environments where conventional visual odometry systems fail. Current approaches face critical limitations: analytical filtering methods suffer from modeling uncertainties and cumulative drift, hybrid learning-filtering approaches remain constrained by their analytical components, while pure learning-based methods struggle with simulation-to-reality transfer and demand extensive real-world data collection. This paper introduces AutoOdom, a novel autoregressive proprioceptive odometry system that overcomes these challenges through an innovative two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 employs large-scale simulation data to learn complex nonlinear dynamics and rapidly changing contact states inherent in legged locomotion, while Stage 2 introduces an autoregressive enhancement mechanism using limited real-world data to effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap. The key innovation lies in our autoregressive training approach, where the model learns from its own predictions to develop resilience against sensor noise and improve robustness in highly dynamic environments. Comprehensive experimental validation on the Booster T1 humanoid robot demonstrates that AutoOdom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation metrics, achieving 57.2% improvement in absolute trajectory error, 59.2% improvement in Umeyama-aligned error, and 36.2% improvement in relative pose error compared to the Legolas baseline. Extensive ablation studies provide critical insights into sensor modality selection and temporal modeling, revealing counterintuitive findings about IMU acceleration data and validating our systematic design choices for robust proprioceptive odometry in challenging locomotion scenarios."

Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset."

To improve computational accuracy, Davidson corrections, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and core-valence electron correlations effects are incorporated into the calculations. The potential energy curves (PECs) of 21 electronic states associated with the two lowest dissociation limits are obtained. The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided. Based on the computed PECs, the spectroscopic constants of bound states are determined. The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states. Finally, the transition properties between excited states and the ground state are studied. Based on the computed transition dipole moments and Franck-Condon Factors, radiative lifetimes for the low-lying vibrational levels of excited states are evaluated."

Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240.

The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics. In this work, we present a novel theoretical approach for determining the CFPs. The procedure resembles the traditional extraction path but crucially accounts for the full $\\ket{J,M_J}$ space of an ion configuration with $L=3$ and $S=\\nicefrac{1}{2}$. By demonstrating the extraction procedure using the simplest case of a Ce$^\\text{III}$ 4f$^1$ ion with a crystal-field split $J \\in \\{\\nicefrac{5}{2}, \\nicefrac{7}{2}\\}$ manifold, it is shown for the first time that a unique set of CFPs describes the splitting and mixing both the $J$ manifolds. In fact, this $J/J^\\prime$ mixing is analogous to the ``spin mixing'' in binuclear transition metal complexes. At the employed level of calculation, we demonstrate that there is no spin-orbit coupling influence on the CFP values, contrary to previous beliefs.

We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy."

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning models for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) struggle with temporal irregularities, particularly stochastic event durations and overlapping timestamps, limiting their adaptability across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a dual input neural network strategy that separates event and sequence attributes, using a duration-aware pseudo-embedding matrix to transform temporal importance into compact, learnable representations. This design is implemented across two baseline families: B-LSTM and B-GCN, and their duration-aware variants D-LSTM and D-GCN. All models incorporate self-tuned hypermodels for adaptive architecture selection. Experiments on balanced and imbalanced outcome prediction tasks show that duration pseudo-embedding inputs consistently improve generalization, reduce model complexity, and enhance interpretability. Our results demonstrate the benefits of explicit temporal encoding and provide a flexible design for robust, real-world PPM applications."

Although prior work has demonstrated deep learning models with strong performance in the heart rate estimation task, in order to deploy these models on wearable devices, these models must also adhere to strict memory and latency constraints. In this work, we explore and characterize how large pre-trained PPG models may be distilled to smaller models appropriate for real-time inference on the edge. We evaluate four distillation strategies through comprehensive sweeps of teacher and student model capacities: (1) hard distillation, (2) soft distillation, (3) decoupled knowledge distillation (DKD), and (4) feature distillation. We present a characterization of the resulting scaling laws describing the relationship between model size and performance. This early investigation lays the groundwork for practical and predictable methods for building edge-deployable models for physiological sensing."

To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\\times$256."

    "abstract": "Ranking models have become an important part of modern personalized recommendation systems. However, significant challenges persist in handling high-cardinality, heterogeneous, and sparse feature spaces, particularly regarding model scalability and efficiency. We identify two key bottlenecks: (i) Representation Bottleneck: Driven by the high cardinality and dynamic nature of features, model capacity is forced into sparse-activated embedding layers, leading to low-rank representations. This, in turn, triggers phenomena like \"One-Epoch\" and \"Interaction-Collapse,\" ultimately hindering model scalability.(ii) Computational Bottleneck: Integrating all heterogeneous features into a unified model triggers an explosion in the number of feature tokens, rendering traditional attention mechanisms computationally demanding and susceptible to attention dispersion. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce STORE, a unified and scalable token-based ranking framework built upon three core innovations: (1) Semantic Tokenization fundamentally tackles feature heterogeneity and sparsity by decomposing high-cardinality sparse features into a compact set of stable semantic tokens; and (2) Orthogonal Rotation Transformation is employed to rotate the subspace spanned by low-cardinality static features, which facilitates more efficient and effective feature interactions; and (3) Efficient attention that filters low-contributing tokens to improve computional efficiency while preserving model accuracy. Across extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework consistently improves prediction accuracy(online CTR by 2.71%, AUC by 1.195%) and training effeciency (1.84 throughput)."

Using strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films as a model system, we resolve the Mn-3d eg orbital polarization with sub-angstrom precision. We show that compressive strain stabilizes 3z2-r2 occupation while tensile strain favors x2-y2. These results validate our approach against established X-ray measurements while achieving the ultimate single atomic-column sensitivity. We further demonstrate two optimized signal extraction protocols that adapt to experimental constraints without compromising sensitivity. This generalizable platform opens unprecedented opportunities to study symmetry-breaking phenomena at individual defects, interfaces, and in quantum materials where atomic-scale electronic anisotropy governs emergent functionality."

However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users."

We apply our theorem to find the largest intersecting family of $r$-independent sets in a family of graphs called ``depth-two claws\".

These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation."

Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) implements global convolutions via parameterizing the integral operators in Fourier space. However, it often results in over-smoothing solutions and fails to capture local details and high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we investigate incorporating the spatial-frequency localization property of Wavelet transforms into the Transformer architecture. We propose a novel Wavelet Attention (WA) module with linear computational complexity to efficiently learn locality-aware features. Building upon WA, we further develop the Spectral Attention Operator Transformer (SAOT), a hybrid spectral Transformer framework that integrates WA's localized focus with the global receptive field of Fourier-based Attention (FA) through a gated fusion block. Experimental results demonstrate that WA significantly mitigates the limitations of FA and outperforms existing Wavelet-based neural operators by a large margin. By integrating the locality-aware and global spectral representations, SAOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six operator learning benchmarks and exhibits strong discretization-invariant ability."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become valuable intellectual property of model owners, due to the substantial resources required for their development. To protect these assets in the deployed environment, recent research has proposed model usage control mechanisms to ensure models cannot be used without proper authorization. These methods typically lock the utility of the model by embedding an access key into its parameters. However, they often assume static deployment, and largely fail to withstand continual post-deployment model updates, such as fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation. In this paper, we propose ADALOC, to endow key-based model usage control with adaptability during model evolution. It strategically selects a subset of weights as an intrinsic access key, which enables all model updates to be confined to this key throughout the evolution lifecycle. ADALOC enables using the access key to restore the keyed model to the latest authorized states without redistributing the entire network (i.e., adaptation), and frees the model owner from full re-keying after each model update (i.e., lock preservation). We establish a formal foundation to underpin ADALOC, providing crucial bounds such as the errors introduced by updates restricted to the access key. Experiments on standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Caltech-256, and Flowers-102, and modern architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, demonstrate that ADALOC achieves high accuracy under significant updates while retaining robust protections. Specifically, authorized usages consistently achieve strong task-specific performance, while unauthorized usage accuracy drops to near-random guessing levels (e.g., 1.01% on CIFAR-100), compared to up to 87.01% without ADALOC. This shows that ADALOC can offer a practical solution for adaptive and protected DNN deployment in evolving real-world scenarios."

This effect are less pronounced with smaller stopping times, stronger gaseous turbulence or imperfect sticking. Regarding planetary migration, we find that CMs make outward migration require $τ\\gtrsim 0.3$ ($τ$ is dimensionless stopping time) with typical turbulent strength and dust coagulation efficiency. We demonstrate that the torque variations are reasonable and arise from phase shifts between the density and stopping time perturbations in the coagulation modes."

While machine learning-based intrusion detection has been widely explored, such methods have not demonstrated detection and mitigation within the required real-time budget. In contrast, cryptographic authentication has emerged as a practical candidate for real-time cyber defense, as specified in IEC 62351. In addition, lightweight rule-based intrusion detection that validates IEC 61850 semantics can provide specification-based detection of anomalous or malicious traffic with minimal processing delay. This paper presents the design logic and implementation aspects of three potential real-time mitigation techniques capable of countering GOOSE-based attacks: (i) IEC 62351-compliant message authentication code (MAC) scheme, (ii) a semantics-enforced rule-based intrusion detection system (IDS), and (iii) a hybrid approach integrating both MAC verification and Intrusion Detection System (IDS). A comparative evaluation of these real-time mitigation approaches is conducted using a cyber-physical system (CPS) security testbed. The results show that the hybrid integration significantly enhances mitigation capability. Furthermore, the processing delays of all three methods remain within the strict delivery requirements of GOOSE communication. The study also identifies limitations that none of the techniques can fully address, highlighting areas for future work."

These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity."

    "abstract": "Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks."

    "abstract": "Mutual trust is a key determinant of decision-making in economic interactions, yet actual behavior often diverges from equilibrium predictions. This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior."

We propose the first deep learning framework for this task, employing a TimeMIL model trained on Log-Mel Spectrogram features and enhanced with pseudo-labeling. On intra-operative recordings, the method achieved 91.17 % +/- 2.79 % accuracy, demonstrating reliable estimation of stem stability. Comparative experiments further show that reducing the diversity of femoral stem brands improves model performance, although limited dataset size remains a bottleneck.

    "abstract": "Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity.

However, it is limited by static deployment and limited adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the complementary relationship between LAE and CPN and propose a novel air-ground collaborative intelligent service provision with an agentification paradigm. Through synergy between LAE and CPNs, computing and communication services are jointly scheduled and collaboratively optimized to enhance the execution efficiency of low-altitude services and improve the flexibility of CPNs. It also integrates LAE's strengths in aerial sensing, mobile coverage, and dynamic communication links, forming a cloud-edge-air collaborative framework. Hence, we review the characteristics and limitations of both LAE and CPN and explore how they can cooperate to overcome these limitations. Then we demonstrate the flexibility of the integrated CPN and LAE framework through a case study. Finally, we summarize the key challenges in constructing an integrated air-ground computing and communication system and discuss future research directions toward emerging technologies."

To address these challenges, we introduce GRIT-LP, a graph transformer explicitly designed for polar ice-layer thickness estimation from polar radar imagery. Accurately estimating ice layer thickness is critical for understanding snow accumulation, reconstructing past climate patterns and reducing uncertainties in projections of future ice sheet evolution and sea level rise. GRIT-LP combines an inductive geometric graph learning framework with self-attention mechanism, and introduces two major innovations that jointly address challenges in modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of ice layers: a partitioned spatial graph construction strategy that forms overlapping, fully connected local neighborhoods to preserve spatial coherence and suppress noise from irrelevant long-range links, and a long-range skip connection mechanism within the transformer that improves information flow and mitigates oversmoothing in deeper attention layers. We conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that GRIT-LP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 24.92\\% improvement in root mean squared error. These results highlight the effectiveness of graph transformers in modeling spatiotemporal patterns by capturing both localized structural features and long-range dependencies across internal ice layers, and demonstrate their potential to advance data-driven understanding of cryospheric processes."

We present Neuron Chunking, an I/O-efficient sparsification strategy that operates on chunks (i.e., groups of contiguous neurons in memory) and couples neuron importance with storage access cost. The method models I/O latency through a lightweight abstraction of access contiguity and selects chunks with high utility, defined as neuron importance normalized by estimated latency. By aligning sparsification decisions with the underlying storage behavior, Neuron Chunking improves I/O efficiency by up to 4.65x and 5.76x on Jetson Orin Nano and Jetson AGX Orin, respectively."

Leveraging pretrained LLMs, we propose a channel quality prediction method empowered by LLMs to optimize AMC, termed LLM4AMC. We freeze most parameters of the LLM and fine-tune it to fully utilize the knowledge acquired during pretraining while better adapting it to the AMC task. We design a network architecture composed of four modules, a preprocessing layer, an embedding layer, a backbone network, and an output layer, effectively capturing the time-varying characteristics of channel quality to achieve accurate predictions of future channel conditions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves link performance and exhibits potential for practical deployment."

    "abstract": "Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings."

Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants."

The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets."

These events accelerate electrons, generating hard X-ray emissions and often display Quasi Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) across the energy spectra. However, the energy transfer process remains poorly constrained, with competing theories proposing different acceleration mechanisms. We investigate electron acceleration and transport in a flaring coronal loop by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. Our model incorporates transient turbulent acceleration, simulating the effects of impulsive energy input to emulate the dynamics of time-dependent reconnection processes. We compute the density-weighted electron flux, a diagnostic directly comparable to observed X-ray emissions, across the energy and spatial domains from the corona to the chromosphere. We investigate different time-dependent functional forms of the turbulent acceleration, finding that the functional form of the acceleration source maintains its signature across energy bands (1 to 100 keV) with a response time that is energy dependent (with higher energy bands displaying a longer response time). In addition, we find that (a) for a square pulse the switch on and off response time is different; (b) for a sinusoidal input the periodicity is preserved; and (c) for a damped sinusoidal the decay rate increases with density and higher energy bands lose energy faster. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing electron acceleration and transport in flares driven by time-dependent sources."

    "abstract": "A suitable choice of the representation of candidate solutions is crucial for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms and related metaheuristics. We focus on problems in permutation spaces, which are at the core of numerous practical applications of such algorithms, e.g. in scheduling and transportation. Inversion vectors (also called Lehmer codes) are an alternative representation of the permutation space $S_n$ compared to the classical encoding as a vector of $n$ unique entries. In particular, they do not require any constraint handling. Using rigorous mathematical runtime analyses, we compare the efficiency of inversion vector encodings to the classical representation and give theory-guided advice on their choice. Moreover, we link the effect of local changes in the inversion code space to classical measures on permutations like the number of inversions. Finally, through experimental studies on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems, we demonstrate the practical efficiency of inversion vector encodings."

    "abstract": "Connected clustering denotes a family of constrained clustering problems in which we are given a distance metric and an undirected connectivity graph $G$ that can be completely unrelated to the metric. The aim is to partition the $n$ vertices into a given number $k$ of clusters such that every cluster forms a connected subgraph of $G$ and a given clustering objective gets minimized. The constraint that the clusters are connected has applications in many different fields, like for example community detection and geodesy. So far, $k$-center and $k$-median have been studied in this setting. It has been shown that connected $k$-median is $Ω(n^{1- ε})$-hard to approximate which also carries over to the connected $k$-means problem, while for connected $k$-center it remained an open question whether one can find a constant approximation in polynomial time. We answer this question by providing an $Ω(\\log^*(k))$-hardness result for the problem. Given these hardness results, we study the problems on graphs with bounded treewidth. We provide exact algorithms that run in polynomial time if the treewidth $w$ is a constant. Furthermore, we obtain constant approximation algorithms that run in FPT time with respect to the parameter $\\max(w,k)$. Additionally, we consider the min-sum-radii (MSR) and min-sum-diameter (MSD) objective. We prove that on general graphs connected MSR can be approximated with an approximation factor of $(3 + ε)$ and connected MSD with an approximation factor of $(4 + ε)$. The latter also directly improves the best known approximation guarantee for unconstrained MSD from $(6 + ε)$ to $(4 + ε)$."

    "abstract": "Multimode fiber~(MMF) imaging using deep learning has high potential to produce compact, minimally invasive endoscopic systems. Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions."

Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules."

Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its widespread integration into mobile software applications have received significant attention, highlighting the growing prominence of AI capabilities in modern software systems. However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques. To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%)."

In this article, stable equivalences between centralizer matrix algebras over arbitrary fields are completely characterized in terms of a new equivalence relation on matrices. Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions. Our methods also show that algebras stably equivalent to a centralizer matrix algebra over a field have the same number of non-isomorphic, non-projective simple modules. Thus the Auslander--Reiten conjecture on stable equivalences holds true for centralizer matrix algebras."

In this study, we delve into the evolution of the critical current density ($J_{\\rm{c}}$) with doping in FeSe${_{1-x}}$(Te/S)${_{x}}$ single crystals, focusing on the behavior within the two superconducting domes. Surprisingly, three maxima of $J_{\\rm{c}}$ were found in the two superconducting domes, with two sharp peaks in $J_{\\rm{c}}$ observed precisely at the endpoints of the nematic phases, at $x$(Te) $\\sim$ 0.5 for Te-doped and $x$(S) $\\sim$ 0.17 for S-doped FeSe. The mechanisms of vortex pinning and the influence of quantum critical fluctuations have been extensively explored, emphasizing the contribution of quantum critical fluctuations in modulating $J_{\\rm{c}}$. Additionally, an increase in $J_{\\rm{c}}$ was also noted near FeSe$_{0.1}$Te$_{0.9}$, where its origin has been explored and discussed. This finding provides crucial clues about the existence of an ordered phase endpoint beneath the superconducting dome, offering an initial basis for further investigation into the potential presence of a QCP beneath it."

In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones."

To address this challenge, MASt3R-SLAM utilizes learned 3D reconstruction priors, enabling more efficient and accurate estimation of both 3D structures and camera poses. However, MASt3R-SLAM is limited to single-agent operation. In this paper, we extend MASt3R-SLAM to introduce the first multi-agent monocular dense SLAM system. Each agent performs local SLAM using a 3D reconstruction prior, and their individual maps are fused into a globally consistent map through a loop-closure-based map fusion mechanism. Our approach improves computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining similar mapping accuracy when evaluated on real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "We develop a weakly nonlinear, multi-mode theory for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) on a time-varying spherical interface, fully incorporating mode couplings and the Bell-Plesset (BP) effects arising from interface convergence. Our model extends prior analyses, which have been largely restricted to static backgrounds, 2D cylindrical geometries, or single-mode initial conditions. We present a framework capable of evolving arbitrary, fully three-dimensional initial perturbations on a dynamic background. At the first order, mode amplitudes respond to the time-varying interface acceleration with an exponential-like growth, in qualitative agreement with classic static results. At second order, nonlinear mode coupling reveals a powerful selection rule: energy is preferentially channeled into axisymmetric (m=0) modes. We find that the BP effects dramatically amplify the instability growth by a few orders of magnitude, with this amplification being even more significant for second order couplings. Despite this strong channeling, the second order amplitudes remain small relative to the first order, validating the perturbative approach. These findings offer new physical insights into time-dependent interface instabilities relevant to applications such as astrophysical shell collapse and inertial confinement fusion, highlighting the uniquely dominant role of axisymmetric modes in BP-driven convergent flows."

Specifically, we initiate the study of characterizing the graph families that are $H$-\\emph{testable} in this model. A graph family $\\mathcal{F}$ is $H$-testable if, for every graph $H$, $H$-\\emph{freeness} (that is, not having a subgraph isomorphic to $H$) is testable with one-sided error on all inputs from $\\mathcal{F}$. Czumaj and Sohler showed that for any $H$-testable family of graphs $\\mathcal{F}$, the family of testable properties of $\\mathcal{F}$ has a known characterization, a major goal in the study of property testing. Consequently, characterizing the collection of $H$-testable graph families will not only result in new characterizations, but will also exhaust this method of characterizing testable properties. We believe that our result is a substantial step towards this goal. Czumaj and Sohler further showed that the family of planar graphs is $H$-testable, as is any family of minor-free graphs. In this paper, we provide a sufficient and much broader criterion under which a family of graphs is $H$-testable. As a corollary, we obtain new characterizations for many families of graphs including: families that are closed under taking topological minors or immersions, geometric intersection graphs of low-density objects, euclidean nearest-neighbour graphs with bounded clique number, graphs with bounded crossing number (per edge), graphs with bounded queue- and stack number, and more. The criterion we provide is based on the \\emph{$r$-admissibility} graph measure from the theory of sparse graph families initiated by Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. Proving that specific families of graphs satisfy this criterion is an active area of research, consequently, the implications of this paper may be strengthened in the future."

This paper proposes Cluster-based Routing using Deep Reinforcement Learning (CR-DRL), an adaptive routing approach that integrates an Actor-Critic learning framework with a heuristic function. CR-DRL enables real-time optimal relay selection and dynamic cluster overlap adjustment to maintain connectivity while minimizing redundant transmissions and enhancing routing efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. CR-DRL extends node lifetimes by up to 21%, overall energy use is reduced by 17%, and nodes remain active for 15% longer. Communication performance also improves, with up to 10% higher delivery ratio, 28.5% lower delay, 7% higher throughput, and data requiring 30% fewer transmission steps across the network."

This transformation is facilitated by a specific redistribution of the nanoparticle ions, which effectively compensates the emerging polar facets at the moment of transition. These insights offer a deeper understanding of oxide nanoparticle formation, which should ultimately help the design of materials with targeted structural features."

Such a setup has applications in cognitive radio networks. For this blind OFDM parameter estimation problem, we provide a novel method based on eigen-spectral analysis of the covariance matrix corresponding to the received data. In particular, we show that the covariance matrix exhibits a distinctive rank property under correct segmentation of the received symbols, reflecting a characteristic behavior in its eigenvalue spectrum that facilitates accurate estimation of the number of subcarriers. The proposed method is more general than existing approaches in the literature, as it can detect an arbitrary number of subcarriers and its performance remains independent of the modulation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed method accurately detects the number of subcarriers with high probability even at low SNR."

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate powerful capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet they also harbor safety vulnerabilities. To enhance LLM safety, various jailbreak defense methods have been proposed to guard against harmful outputs. However, improvements in model safety often come at the cost of severe over-refusal, failing to strike a good balance between safety and usability. In this paper, we first analyze the causes of over-refusal from a representation perspective, revealing that over-refusal samples reside at the boundary between benign and malicious samples. Based on this, we propose MOSR, designed to mitigate over-refusal by intervening the safety representation of LLMs. MOSR incorporates two novel components: (1) Overlap-Aware Loss Weighting, which determines the erasure weight for malicious samples by quantifying their similarity to pseudo-malicious samples in the representation space, and (2) Context-Aware Augmentation, which supplements the necessary context for rejection decisions by adding harmful prefixes before rejection responses. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in mitigating over-refusal while largely maintaining safety. Overall, we advocate that future defense methods should strike a better balance between safety and over-refusal."

Some leave their country for the first time, others return to places they once called home, or move on to new destinations. However, most models focus only on who arrives, missing the full picture of how migrant populations evolve. We introduce a model for diaspora flows that estimates both arrivals and exits using daily migration flow rates, disaggregated by age and nationality. Drawing on high-resolution administrative data from Austria covering over 1.8 million foreign nationals, the model allocates these movements across more than 2,000 municipalities based on the size of local diaspora communities. We find that exits are not exceptions but a consistent and predictable feature across all groups. Migration rejuvenates Austria's population, as both arriving and departing migrants are younger than the average resident. This effect has distinct age-geography patterns: younger migrants are drawn to cities, while older migrants are more evenly distributed in the country. By capturing both arrivals and exits simultaneously, our approach provides a more comprehensive and interpretable picture of migration dynamics, how populations change over time, and how they are influenced by space, age, and national origins."

Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU."

In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation."

The CPRs demonstrate a pronounced $\\varphi_0$ of the order of unity and a pronounced Josephson diode effect with the diode efficiency $ \\lesssim 0.3$. Moreover, the efficiency can be controlled via rotation of in-plane magnetization in the interlayer. The prospects for utilizing alternative magnetic $Ln$-based materials of the $LnT_2X_2$ family ($T$ is a transition metal and $X$ is a $p$-element from groups III-V) for the implementation in $\\varphi_0$-S/F/S JJs are also discussed."

    "abstract": "One of the desirable objectives in feedback control design is to formulate and solve the design problem as an optimisation problem that is convex, so that an optimal solution can be found efficiently. Unfortunately many control design problems are non-convex: approximations, relaxations, or iterative schemes are usually employed to solve them. Several such approaches have been developed in the literature, for example Sum-of-Squares (SOSs) methods have been used for systems described by polynomial dynamics. Alternatively, and relevant to this paper, one can choose a (non-unique) linear-like representation of the system and solve the resulting state-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) or use SOSs optimisation techniques to derive a control law. This SOS method has been shown to effectively design polynomial and rational controllers for nonlinear polynomial systems, offering a broader class of controllers and the potential for improved performance and robustness guarantees. In this paper, we start off by considering rational functions as controllers for nonlinear systems and propose a procedure for designing such controllers by iteratively solving convex SOS optimisation problems. Our approach decouples the controller structure from the system dynamics and incorporates it as a constraint within the optimisation problem, which results in an optimisation that co-designs aspects of the controller and the Lyapunov function at the same iterative step. We theoretically establish the properties of this procedure by showing that several existing rational controller design methods can be recovered as special cases of this procedure. The proposed method is evaluated on various nonlinear benchmark system examples, demonstrating improved performance and robustness over both polynomial controllers and rational controllers obtained by existing approaches."

The disk around the Herbig star HD 100453 presents one such environment, with an inner disk that is significantly misaligned with respect to the outer disk. This paper expands the existing H-band (PIONIER) and K-band (GRAVITY) interferometric studies of the HD 100453 inner disk to the L-band with the MATISSE VLTI instrument. With snapshot data spanning approximately four years we aim for a more comprehensive understanding of the inner disk structures and their potential time evolution. Based on the MATISSE data obtained, we use a combination of analytical models and image reconstruction to constrain the disk structure. Additionally, we fit a temperature gradient model to the selected wavelength range of PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE to derive physical properties of the inner regions. Our parametric model finds an inclination of $\\sim 47.5^\\circ$ and a position angle of $\\sim 83.6^\\circ$, which corroborates the case of strong inner-outer disk misalignment. From the symmetric temperature gradient we derive an inner disk radius around $\\sim0.27$ au, with dust surface densities of $Σ_{\\rm{subl}} \\approx 10^{-3.2}$ g/cm$^2$ and vertical optical depth $τ_{\\rm{z, subl}} \\approx 0.1-0.06$. Same-night MATISSE and GRAVITY observations indicate the necessity for higher-order asymmetries to explain the interferometric signals, which is further supported by a MATISSE snapshot image reconstruction. The chromatic interferometric data reveal the likely need for higher-order asymmetries to explain the inner disk of HD~100453, suggesting a possible origin in dynamic interactions or disk instabilities. Coordinated multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations with GRAVITY and MATISSE will be crucial to confirm these findings and uncover its underlying nature."

To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements."

However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants."

It remains a mystery whether the ULAs can make up a fraction of DM or DE. Although theoretical predictions indicate that the ULAs may leave distinct imprints on cosmological signals, these signatures may exist in a broad spatial and temporal scales, and may be degenerate with the known effects of the standard model. The ULA signatures are extremely subtle and the observational evidence of the ULAs remain elusive. In this work, we infer the ULA properties using both the early and late universe observations from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We validate modeling of the ULA effects using the CMB and BAO mock data and perform different tests to cross-check the results. By analyzing the Planck 2018 CMB measurements and the BAO measurements from the Data Release 2 of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we constrain the energy density fraction ratio of the ULAs to total dark matter $Ω_a/Ω_d$ and obtain a new upper bound of $Ω_a/Ω_d$. Future CMB and BAO measurements will achieve unprecedented precision and will be crucial for understanding the nature of the ULAs."

    "abstract": "Movable antennas (MAs) have emerged as a promising technology to improve wireless communication and sensing performance towards sixth-generation (6G) networks through flexible antenna movement. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless sensing system based on MA arrays to enhance multi-target spatial angle estimation performance. We begin by characterizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) matrix for multi-target angle of arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the antenna's positions in MA arrays, thereby establishing a theoretical foundation for antenna position optimization. Then, aiming at improving the sensing coverage performance, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the expectation of the trace of the CRB matrix over random target angles subject to a given distribution by optimizing the antennas' positions. To tackle the formulated challenging optimization problem, the Monte Carlo method is employed to approximate the intractable objective function, and a swarm-based gradient descent algorithm is subsequently proposed to address the approximated problem. In addition, a lower-bound on the sum of CRBs for multi-target AoA estimation is derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-based design achieves superior sensing performance compared to conventional systems using fixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays and single-target-oriented MA arrays, in terms of decreasing both CRB and the actual AoA estimation mean square error (MSE). Fundamentally, the designed MA array geometry exhibits low correlation and high effective power of sensitivity vectors for multi-target sensing in the angular domain, leading to significant CRB performance improvement. The resultant low correlation of steering vectors over multiple targets' directions further helps mitigate angle estimation ambiguity and thus enhances MSE performance."

    "abstract": "The earliest phase of the Milky Way's evolution involved a transition from a dispersion-supported proto-galaxy to a rotationally supported disk. A key chemical signature of this transition is the moderate rise in [$α$/Fe] near $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\\approx-1.3$, which we previously interpreted as evidence for $α$-enhanced gas accretion fueling early disk formation. However, this trend alone does not uniquely constrain the trade-off between initial gas mass, inflow rate, and star formation efficiency (SFE), leaving the physical condition of the proto-Milky Way uncertain. To break this degeneracy, we analyze the metal-poor tail ($-3<\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-2$) of the Milky Way's metallicity distribution function (MDF) using Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) metallicities from ten catalogs. After applying recommended quality cuts, all catalogs exhibit a single-slope exponential tail with slopes $k\\simeq0.5$--2.0. Comparison with one-zone galactic chemical-evolution (GCE) models that replicated the [$α$/Fe]-rise from Paper I shows that shallow tails ($k\\simeq0.6$) require a massive initial cold gas reservoir ($\\gtrsim10^9\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), while steeper tails ($k\\gtrsim1$) arise from small reservoirs that built up over time with weak inflow. MDFs with $k \\simeq 1.0$ are best reproduced under our GCE framework, which favor a proto-Galaxy with a moderate gas reservoir ($10^{8}$--$10^{9}\\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) sustained through weak continuous inflow ($\\sim 2 \\ \\mathrm{M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1}}$) and SFE comparable to today's value (a few $\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) during the first Gyr. This scenario is reinforced by MDFs of 30 Milky Way analogs in the Auriga simulations, which exhibit similar slopes ($k\\approx1.2$). The metal-poor MDF tail thus provides a quantitative constraint on the Milky Way's early gas accretion and star formation history."

This type of measurement makes it possible to characterise contacts in clusters of cylinders to simulate clusters of grains, or the properties of fibrous media in the transverse direction or, under certain conditions, to detect emerging thermal resistances (cracks perpendicular to the observation plane) by IR thermography. Here, the thermal model is simplified because the temperature field in relaxation on either side of the resistance can be considered isothermal with a separation of transfers in the plane and along the thickness. The mathematical model is then analytical (relaxation of a linear system), and the processing of the temperature field can be inversed thanks to the consideration of the logarithm of matrices, useful when studying the propagation of measurement noise. The method proposed in the case of two or three cylinders is a first step and a validation for applications to the study of more complex media (large number of cylinders, granular media)."

The aggregation behaviour in vitro is well understood and driven by the equilibration of a super-saturated protein solution to its aggregated equilibrium state. However, the situation is altered fundamentally in living systems where active processes consume energy to remove aggregates. It remains unclear how and why cells transition from a state with predominantly monomeric protein, which is stable over decades, to one dominated by aggregates. Here, we develop a simple but universal theoretical framework to describe cellular systems that include both aggregate formation and removal. Using a two-dimensional phase-plane representation, we show that the interplay of aggregate formation and removal generates cell-level bistability, with a bifurcation structure that explains both the emergence of disease and the effects of therapeutic interventions. We explore a wide range of aggregate formation and removal mechanisms and show that phenomena such as seeding arise robustly when a minimal set of requirements on the mechanism are satisfied. By connecting in vitro aggregation mechanisms to changes in cell state, our framework provides a general conceptual link between molecular-level therapeutic interventions and their impact on disease progression."

Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions."

    "abstract": "Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows."

These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures.

The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \\leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N. Building on this finding, we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N GHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that exhibit enhanced performance, as well as efficient excitation of bulk acoustic waves with low propagation losses. These results establish Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N as a promising platform for next-generation high-frequency electromechanical devices, with prospects for further piezoelectric enhancements through improved epitaxy."

    "abstract": "We extend non-invertible duality concepts from one-dimensional systems to two spatial dimensions by constructing a web of non-invertible dualities for lattice models with subsystem symmetries. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."

    "abstract": "Over the recent years, crossroads of magnetism and superconductivity led to the emerging field of superconducting spintronics. A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities."

    "abstract": "We propose a fully data-driven approach to designing mutual information (MI) estimators. Since any MI estimator is a function of the observed sample from two random variables, we parameterize this function with a neural network (MIST) and train it end-to-end to predict MI values. Training is performed on a large meta-dataset of 625,000 synthetic joint distributions with known ground-truth MI. To handle variable sample sizes and dimensions, we employ a two-dimensional attention scheme ensuring permutation invariance across input samples. To quantify uncertainty, we optimize a quantile regression loss, enabling the estimator to approximate the sampling distribution of MI rather than return a single point estimate. This research program departs from prior work by taking a fully empirical route, trading universal theoretical guarantees for flexibility and efficiency. Empirically, the learned estimators largely outperform classical baselines across sample sizes and dimensions, including on joint distributions unseen during training. The resulting quantile-based intervals are well-calibrated and more reliable than bootstrap-based confidence intervals, while inference is orders of magnitude faster than existing neural baselines. Beyond immediate empirical gains, this framework yields trainable, fully differentiable estimators that can be embedded into larger learning pipelines. Moreover, exploiting MI's invariance to invertible transformations, meta-datasets can be adapted to arbitrary data modalities via normalizing flows, enabling flexible training for diverse target meta-distributions."

Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations. To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both \"where to go\" and \"where not to go.\" To be formal, we propose \\textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones. On ImageNet-1K 256$\\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\\% and 35\\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

We also analyze PSR J0737-3039A according to its moment of inertia inferred from Bayesian modeling of nuclear equation of state. A recent multimessenger constraint on the tidal deformability is also studied, resulting in an estimate value of the trace anomaly $Δ_c = 0.1770^{+0.0365}_{-0.0432}$ at the center of a $1.4M_\\odot$ canonical neutron star.

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), where centralized critics leverage global information to guide decentralized actors. However, centralized-decentralized mismatch (CDM) arises when the suboptimal behavior of one agent degrades others' learning. Prior approaches mitigate CDM through value decomposition, but linear decompositions allow per-agent gradients at the cost of limited expressiveness, while nonlinear decompositions improve representation but require centralized gradients, reintroducing CDM. To overcome this trade-off, we propose the multi-agent cross-entropy method (MCEM), combined with monotonic nonlinear critic decomposition (NCD). MCEM updates policies by increasing the probability of high-value joint actions, thereby excluding suboptimal behaviors. For sample efficiency, we extend off-policy learning with a modified k-step return and Retrace. Analysis and experiments demonstrate that MCEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both continuous and discrete action benchmarks."

The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model. By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario."

The proposed method introduces a configurable framework that flexibly defines the evolutionary parameters, enabling the construction of adaptive circuits. Experimental evaluation of datasets, including Digits, Fashion, Wine, and Breast Cancer, demonstrates that GA-QSVMs achieve a comparable accuracy compared to classical SVMs and standard QSVMs. Furthermore, transfer learning results indicate that GA-QSVM's circuits generalize effectively across datasets.

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based localization algorithms presents potential for enhancing localization accuracy. Nevertheless, current standardization efforts in the third generation partnership project (3GPP) and the O-RAN Alliance do not support AI/ML-based localization. In order to close this standardization gap, this paper describes an O-RAN framework that enables the integration of AI/ML-based localization algorithms for real-time deployments and testing. Specifically, our framework includes an O-RAN E2 Service Model (E2SM) and the corresponding radio access network (RAN) function, which exposes the Uplink Sounding Reference Signal (UL-SRS) channel estimates from the E2 agent to the Near real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC). Moreover, our framework includes, as an example, a real-time localization external application (xApp), which leverages the custom E2SM-SRS in order to execute continuous inference on a trained Channel Charting (CC) model, which is an emerging self-supervised method for radio-based localization. Our framework is implemented with OpenAirInterface (OAI) and FlexRIC, democratizing access to AI-driven positioning research and fostering collaboration. Furthermore, we validate our approach with the CC xApp in real-world conditions using an O-RAN based localization testbed at EURECOM. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in enabling real-time AI/ML localization and show the potential of O-RAN in empowering positioning use cases for next-generation AI-native networks."

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies. This is further supported by the observation that higher O$_2$ pressures increase the conversion and that the catalyst remains stable and active over several cycles."

For all graphs $G$, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak (1995) proved that $\\frac{1}{χ(G)} \\leq \\mathscr{I}(G) \\leq \\frac{1}{ω(G)}$ where $χ(G)$ is the chromatic number, and $ω(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. So all graphs $G$ with $χ(G) = ω(G)$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(G) = \\frac{1}{χ(G)} = \\frac{1}{ω(G)}$. A construction of Zhu demonstrates that there exists a graph $G$ with $\\frac{1}{χ(G)} < \\mathscr{I}(G) < \\frac{1}{ω(G)}$, so neither equality holds in general. In response, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak conjectured that all wheel graphs $W_n$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(W_n) = \\frac{1}{χ(W_n)}$. For even wheels $W_{2t}$ this follows from the fact $χ(W_{2t}) = ω(W_{2t}) = 3$. Odd wheels of length at least $5$ present a more challenging case, since $χ(W_{2t+1}) = 4$ and $ω(W_{2t+1}) = 3$. First, we prove that odd wheels of length at least $7$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(W_{2t+1})\\leq \\frac{4t^2+6t}{3(2t+2)^2}<\\frac{1}{3}$, which provides the best upper bound for large odd wheels.

Here, we use a hierarchical Bayesian scheme, based on the formula for $\\langle n^{2} \\rangle$, to infer the population-level distribution of $n_{\\rm pl}+\\dot{K}_{\\rm dim}$ for a sample of $68$ young radio pulsars, observed for $\\gtrsim 10~{\\rm years}$ with Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope. Upon assuming that the $n_{\\rm pl}+\\dot{K}_{\\rm dim}$ values are drawn from a population-level Gaussian, $N(μ_{\\rm pl}, σ_{\\rm pl})$, the Bayesian scheme returns the mean $μ_{\\rm pl} = 9.95^{+5.58}_{-5.26}$ and standard deviation $σ_{\\rm pl}=10.89^{+5.14}_{-3.69}$. At a per-pulsar level it returns posterior medians satisfying $-13.86 \\leq n_{\\rm pl}+\\dot{K}_{\\rm dim} \\leq 30.38$. The secular anomaly dominates the stochastic anomaly, with posterior medians satisfying $|n_{\\rm pl} + \\dot{K}_{\\rm dim}| \\geq σ_{\\rm dim}$ in 10 out of 68 objects."

    "abstract": "Mechanical control systems such as aerial, marine, space, and terrestrial robots often naturally admit a state-space that has the structure of a Lie group. The kinetic energy of such systems is commonly invariant to the induced action by the Lie group, and the system dynamics can be written as a coupled ordinary differential equation on the group and the dual space of its Lie algebra, termed a Lie-Poisson system. In this paper, we show that Lie-Poisson systems can also be written as a left-invariant system on a semi-direct Lie group structure placed on the trivialised cotangent bundle of the symmetry group. The authors do not know of a prior reference for this observation and we are confident the insight has never been exploited in the context of tracking control. We use this representation to build a right-invariant tracking error for the full state of a Lie-Poisson mechanical system and show that the error dynamics for this error are themselves of Lie-Poisson structure, albeit with time-varying inertia. This allows us to tackle the general trajectory tracking problem using an energy shaping design metholodology. To demonstrate the approach, we apply the proposed design methodology to a simple attitude tracking control."

Prior work has focused on endpoint metrics (e.g., fidelity, likelihood, perceptual quality) while overlooking a deeper question: what do the sampling trajectories reveal? Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce kinetic path energy (KPE), a simple yet powerful diagnostic that quantifies the total kinetic effort along each generation path of ODE-based samplers. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-256, we uncover two key phenomena: ({i}) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic quality, indicating that semantically richer samples require greater kinetic effort, and ({ii}) higher KPE inversely correlates with data density, with informative samples residing in sparse, low-density regions. Together, these findings reveal that semantically informative samples naturally reside on the sparse frontier of the data distribution, demanding greater generative effort. Our results suggest that trajectory-level analysis offers a physics-inspired and interpretable framework for understanding generation difficulty and sample characteristics."

This extends the semigroup-fication procedure introduced by Bracci and Roth to non-univalent functions. We use our technique in order to obtain sharp estimates for the rate with which the orbits of $f$ converge to the attracting fixed point; a fundamental, yet underdeveloped, concept in discrete iteration. Moreover, our semigroup-fication allows us to evaluate the slope of the orbits of $f$, and prove that they behave similarly to quasi-geodesic curves precisely when they converge non-tangentially."

Two alternative solver-based algorithms are proposed, one that generates a minimal test suite, and another that does not ensure minimality. Both algorithms were implemented in a prototype that can be used generate test suites to help choose among alternative Alloy specifications. Our evaluation of this prototype against a large set of problems showed that the optimal algorithm is efficient enough for many practical problems, and that the non-optimal algorithm can scale up to dozens of candidate specifications while still generating reasonably sized test suites."

The algorithm's main component is the optimization of receiver configurations using a left-right heuristic combined with linear programming. Our approach is unique because, unlike others, we focus on optimizing available resources and observed frequencies, which was never done before. We experimentally compared the proposed algorithm with a greedy and the state-of-the-art method for construction of PSS schedules. In most of the considered scenarios, ResourceTune outperformed both algorithms, and in the most extreme case, its objective value was more than 2.7 times better than the values reached by other methods."

However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction."

To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline."

The corresponding subproblems are then solved by alternating direction method of multipliers to satisfy the specific stop criteria. In particular, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm guarantees the feasibility of each subsequent iteration point, and the cluster point of the resulting feasible sequence is shown to be a stationary point.

This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems."

    "abstract": "Multi-assembly methods rely at their core on a flow decomposition problem, namely, decomposing a weighted graph into weighted paths or walks. However, most results over the past decade have focused on decompositions over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This limitation has lead to either purely heuristic methods, or in applications transforming a graph with cycles into a DAG via preprocessing heuristics. In this paper we show that flow decomposition problems can be solved in practice also on general graphs with cycles, via a framework that yields fast and flexible Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations. Our key technique relies on the graph-theoretic notion of dominator tree, which we use to find all safe sequences of edges, that are guaranteed to appear in some walk of any flow decomposition solution. We generalize previous results from DAGs to cyclic graphs, by showing that maximal safe sequences correspond to extensions of common leaves of two dominator trees, and that we can find all of them in time linear in their size. Using these, we can accelerate MILPs for any flow decomposition into walks in general graphs, by setting to (at least) 1 suitable variables encoding solution walks, and by setting to 0 other walks variables non-reachable to and from safe sequences. This reduces model size and eliminates costly linearizations of MILP variable products. We experiment with three decomposition models (Minimum Flow Decomposition, Least Absolute Errors and Minimum Path Error), on four bacterial datasets. Our pre-processing enables up to thousand-fold speedups and solves even under 30 seconds many instances otherwise timing out. We thus hope that our dominator-based MILP simplification framework, and the accompanying software library can become building blocks in multi-assembly applications."

We implement our model within a Penalized Spline framework and estimate it using Generalized Linear Array Model techniques, resulting in a computationally fast, interpretable, and parsimonious method. Crucially, it can readily incorporate sudden mortality shocks, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, making it highly versatile for real-world demographic and epidemiological challenges. We demonstrate its application by estimating life expectancy and age-specific mortality inequalities in over 4,800 small areas across the Greater London Authority from 2002 to 2024."

While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation."

In particular, the predicted first-order region is found to be small, in line with the most recent lattice QCD analyses. We also examine the critical behavior along the second-order boundaries and the tricritical region, finding that the critical exponents exhibit mean-field scaling characteristic of classical holographic constructions. Integrating machine learning with holographic QCD significantly enhances the efficiency of parameter optimization, providing a robust and practical strategy for improving the predictive power of holographic modeling of QCD thermodynamics."

Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights.

To further enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a quotient-manifold-based optimization framework that leverages the underlying Riemannian geometry in a matrix factorization space. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between spectral-sparse signals and matrix equivalence classes under the action of the real orthogonal group, where each class member corresponds to a rank-constrained positive-semidefinite Hankel-Toeplitz structured matrix. The associated quotient manifold geometry--including the Riemannian metric, horizontal space, retraction, and vector transport--is rigorously derived. Based on these results, we develop a Riemannian conjugate gradient descent algorithm, where each iteration is efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) by exploiting the Hankel and Toeplitz structures.

We analyze linear perturbations around a flat FLRW background and find that the theory generically exhibits ghost instabilities, except for the special case of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) supplemented by the parity-violating operator. Using both the Dirac-Bergmann procedure and the Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm, we show that this remaining case propagates eight degrees of freedom at the fully non-linear level. This result implies that the parity-violating extension of STEGR is strongly coupled around FLRW and therefore lies beyond the regime of validity of standard linear perturbation theory."

In the last two scenarios, it might also be identified as the state $X(3930)$. The formalism employed to generate this structure dynamically is based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a general $S$-wave potential. We investigate how the relevant properties and observables characterizing this state--such as the pole position, scattering length, and effective range--might be affected by variations in the model parameters. The amplitudes encoding the distinct interpretations of the $X(3960)$ state are then used as input to calculate the femtoscopic correlation function of the $D_s^+ D_s^- $ pair, which is analyzed and discussed."

    "abstract": "The widespread application of AIGC contents has brought not only unprecedented opportunities, but also potential security concerns, e.g., audio-visual deepfakes. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FoVB outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks."

However, ultrafast exciton decay and quenched photoluminescence (PL) limit their potential. Combining femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with first-principles calculations on MoS2 and WS2 nanoplatelets, we reveal that the observed sub-picosecond exciton decay originates from edge-located optically bright hole traps. These intrinsic trap states stem from the metal d-orbitals and persist even when the sulfur-terminated edges are hydrogen-passivated. Notably, WS2 nanostructures show more localized and optically active edge states than their MoS2 counterparts, and zigzag edges exhibit a higher trap density than armchair edges. The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombina- tion, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL."

    "abstract": "Improving the efficiency of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has become increasingly urgent with the rapid development of space exploration. To address this issue, the direct intermittent general synthetic iteration (DIG) scheme has recently been proposed to enable DSMC's rapid and accurate convergence to steady-state solutions, even when the cell size is much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes. The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties. Because the Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, the analysis is conducted using the linearized BGK model. It is found that, in the near continuum flow regime, the DIG method asymptotically recovers the Navier Stokes equations when the cell size is O(1), rather than being constrained by the mean free path. Moreover, after a single cycle of DIG evolution, the deviation from the final steady state solution is reduced by more than a factor of five. In the second part of the paper, the Poiseuille flow and hypersonic flow passing over cylinder are investigated using the DIG scheme, with different time step and cell sizes, thereby demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in multiscale flow simulation. Specifically, when the Knudsen number is 0.01, the DIG method is found to be faster than the traditional DSMC method by two orders of magnitude. The performance gain becomes even greater at smaller Knudsen numbers. The proposed method holds great potential for engineering applications."

However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks."

We first tested the feasibility of our method using Fourier local correlation tracking (FLCT) to track physical quantities at different optical depths ($\\logτ_{500}={-1,-2,-3,-4}$) in an atmosphere simulated with the MURaM code. We then inferred the horizontal distribution of the LOS magnetic field component from synthetic spectropolarimetric observations of Fe I 525.0 nm and Mg I b2 spectral lines, applied FLCT to the time sequence of these synthetic magnetograms, and compared our findings with the original height-dependent horizontal velocities. Tracking the LOS magnetic field component (which coincides with the vertical component at the disk center) yields horizontal velocities that, after appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, agree excellently with the horizontal component of the simulated velocities, both calculated at constant $τ_{500}$ surfaces, up to the temperature minimum ($\\logτ_{500}=-3$). When tracking the temperature at constant $τ_{500}$ surfaces, this agreement already breaks down completely at the mid photosphere ($\\logτ_{500}=-2$). Tracking the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from synthetic observations of the Fe I 525.0 nm and the Mg I b2 spectral lines yields a satisfactory inference of the horizontal velocities in the mid-photosphere ($\\logτ_{500}\\approx-1$) and the temperature minimum ($\\logτ_{500}\\approx-3$), respectively.

    "abstract": "We study the coupled dynamics of multilayer networks with symmetric (MLs) and asymmetric (MLas) inter-layer connections. The symmetric inter-layer connections arise from a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of different layers. In contrast, asymmetry results from the multiplicity of inter-layer connections, achieved by randomizing the links while preserving their overall density, thereby allowing one-to-many inter-layer connections. We investigate how different types of inter-layer coupling impact the dynamics of non-identical multilayer networks. We find that the specificity of one-to-one inter-layer connections facilitates intra-layer synchronization (ILS). In contrast, for networks with random inter-layer connectivity, ILS depends on how randomness affects intra-layer homomorphism (the set of permutations that preserve the network structure). Furthermore, amplitude death (AD) in MLs is observed at lower connectivity strength and frequency mismatch than the MLas. Moreover, AD in MLs depends on the density and topology, but does not depend on the size of the networks. On the other hand, AD in MLas is influenced by network size in addition to density, topology, and inter-layer mismatches. Moreover, both the MLs and MLas exhibit multi-stability, with the faster layer exhibiting a remanent periodic phase-locked oscillation, irrespective of the topology and inter-layer connectivity. In addition, remnant synchrony between nodes with homomorphic relationships is observed in the slower layer. Overall, we propose that symmetric inter-layer connections should be preferable for achieving intra-layer synchronization-regardless of global synchronization-and for sustaining permanent memory in multilayer networks with mismatched nodes across layers. However, to mitigate AD at low coupling values and layer mismatch, asymmetric inter-layer connectivity is more advantageous."

We first give a general, deterministic result on properties of second-order critical points for a general class of loss functions; we then specialize this result to the nonsmooth amplitude loss and, additionally, prove nearly identical results for a smooth reformulation (similar to PhaseCut) as a synchronization problem over spheres. Finally, we show the usefulness of these tools by proving high-probability landscape guarantees in two settings: (1) phase retrieval with isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, and (2) phase retrieval in a general (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space with Gaussian measurements. In both cases, our results give state-of-the-art and statistically optimal guarantees with only a constant amount of overparametrization (in the well-studied case of isotropic sub-Gaussian measurements, such statistical guarantees had previously required greater degrees of overparametrization/relaxation); this demonstrates the potential of overparametrized nonconvex optimization as a principled and scalable algorithmic approach to phase retrieval."

We propose that the expanding gas formed from volatile materials by collisional heating dispersed and cooled the silicate melt, resulting in droplet sizes and cooling rates consistent with the observed sizes and inferred cooling rates.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive result that includes the entire data set from these suncharts using a supervised Machine Learning model called \"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\", firstly to identify the solar disks from the charts (1909-2007), secondly to identify the plages, spanning 9 solar cycles (1916-2007). We train the CNN with the manually identified solar disk and plage. We first detect the solar limb and the North-South line in the suncharts, which enables the extraction of disk centre coordinates, radius, and P-angle. Following that, we use a CNN similar architecture to achieve accurate image segmentation for the identification of plages. We compare plage areas derived from the suncharts with those obtained from Ca II K full-disk observations, and find good agreement that demonstrates the potential application of such an ML technique for historical data. The results of this study further demonstrate the potential application of sunchart data to fill the existing data gaps in the KoSO multi-wavelength observations and contribute toward constructing a composite series over the last century."

Machine learning is increasingly used for EEA by modeling rare weather events otherwise too complex or computationally intensive to model using traditional simulation methods. However, the validity of using machine learning in this context remains unclear, particularly as high-stakes machine learning applications in general are criticized for inherent bias and lack of robustness. Here we use machine learning and simulation analyses to evaluate EEA in the context of California wildfire data from 2003-2020. We identify three major threats to validity: (1) individual event attribution estimates are highly sensitive to algorithmic design choices; (2) common performance metrics like area under the ROC curve or Brier score are not strongly correlated with attribution error, facilitating suboptimal model selection; and (3) distribution shift -- changes in temperature across climate scenarios -- substantially degrades predictive performance. To address these challenges, we propose a more valid and robust attribution analysis based on aggregate machine learning estimates, using an additional metric -- mean calibration error -- to assess model performance, and using subgroup and propensity diagnostics to assess distribution shift."

An agent controls her velocity, and, when she occupies a vertex, she can either remain still or enter any adjacent edge. The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge, but may jump at the vertices. Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties. For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function. These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network. Given $m$, the value function $u$ is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi problem on the network. We then investigate the regularity properties of $u$ and a weak form of a Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by $m$."

We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model. A detailed parameter analysis identifies the conditions under which this phenomenon emerges, suggesting that temperature-enhanced superconductivity may be observable in materials such as MgB2 and FeSe through transport and tunneling measurements."

To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \\b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency."

Given that real-world risk is massive ($σ_{Real} \\approx 4.9$), the modern \"Quality\" strategy is objectively fragile. Second, the trap for the Middle/Rich ($B \\ge 200$) is driven by a \"Two-Stage Belief Error\": they are first \"baited\" by a Causal Error (underestimating risk) to enter the status game, and then \"trapped\" by a Marginal Error (underestimating returns) which triggers a stop in fertility. Third, the U-shape is driven by the cognitive divide. The Poor escape the trap by retaining a \"Rational Survival\" strategy in the face of real high risk. Conversely, the Aspirational Middle Class ($HC \\approx 12, B \\ge 200$) is uniquely trapped by their Biased Beliefs.

    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a widely adopted standard for privacy-preserving data analysis, but it assumes a uniform privacy budget across all records, limiting its applicability when privacy requirements vary with data values. Per-record Differential Privacy (PrDP) addresses this by defining the privacy budget as a function of each record, offering better alignment with real-world needs. However, the dependency between the privacy budget and the data value introduces challenges in protecting the budget's privacy itself. Existing solutions either handle specific privacy functions or adopt relaxed PrDP definitions. A simple workaround is to use the global minimum of the privacy function, but this severely degrades utility, as the minimum is often set extremely low to account for rare records with high privacy needs. In this work, we propose a general and practical framework that enables any standard DP mechanism to support PrDP, with error depending only on the minimal privacy requirement among records actually present in the dataset. Since directly revealing this minimum may leak information, we introduce a core technique called privacy-specified domain partitioning, which ensures accurate estimation without compromising privacy. We also extend our framework to the local DP setting via a novel technique, privacy-specified query augmentation. Using our framework, we present the first PrDP solutions for fundamental tasks such as count, sum, and maximum estimation. Experimental results show that our mechanisms achieve high utility and significantly outperform existing Personalized DP (PDP) methods, which can be viewed as a special case of PrDP with relaxed privacy protection."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, fast radio transient searches are conducted on dedispersed time series using thresholding techniques based on the statistical properties of the data. However, peaks in dedispersed time series do not directly provide information on the nature of the source. In the DM-time domain, the S/N variation of real, dispersed astrophysical signals forms a characteristic bow tie shape, whereas radio frequency interference (RFI) can take multiple different forms. We have developed a method that bypasses the thresholding step of traditional single-pulse searches in favour of a direct DM-time domain image analysis. The backbone of our pipeline is a Mask R-CNN, a deep learning model designed for object detection, enabling it to identify the bow tie signature and distinguish real sources from RFI. Previous deep learning models often include a snippet of the DM-time domain in their input. We have trained the model on simulated bursts injected on top of real MeerKAT noise observations. We tested the model on MeerKAT follow-up observations of the repeater FRB20240114A and we were able to recover all bursts with a signal-to-noise above the traditional threshold, while detecting two bursts that were fainter. Our new approach considerably reduces the number of candidates above a nominal threshold while being capable of running in real time for typical surveys. We also propose a modified version of the traditional dedispersion plan optimised for this method."

Vehicle platooning is a promising solution to address these issues by improving road capacity and reducing fuel consumption. However, existing platooning systems face challenges such as reliance on lane markings and expensive high-precision sensors, which limits their general applicability. To address these issues, we propose a vehicle following framework that expands its capability from restricted scenarios to general scenario applications using only a camera. This is achieved through our newly proposed end-to-end method, which improves overall driving performance. The method incorporates a semantic mask to address causal confusion in multi-frame data fusion. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic sampling mechanism to precisely track the trajectories of preceding vehicles. Extensive closed-loop validation in real-world vehicle experiments demonstrates the system's ability to follow vehicles in various scenarios, outperforming traditional multi-stage algorithms. This makes it a promising solution for cost-effective autonomous vehicle platooning. A complete real-world vehicle experiment is available at https://youtu.be/zL1bcVb9kqQ."

To address its computational challenges, we introduce the Partition-based Distance Diversity (PDD) framework, which partitions the graph and retrieves diverse matches from distant regions. To enhance efficiency, we develop two optimizations: embedding-driven partition filtering and densest-based partition selection over a Partition Adjacency Graph. Experiments on 12 real world datasets show our approach achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup over baselines, with 95% of results reaching 80% of optimal distance diversity and 100% coverage diversity."

All data were generated using a standardized quantum-chemical workflow based on an wB97X-D/def2-TZVP level of theory. The CHAOS database covers molecules composed of a diverse set of elements, with molar masses up to 400 amu and dipole moments up to 15 D, and is freely available on Zenodo under an open license. It extends the number of molecules for which sigma-profiles are publicly available by more than an order of magnitude and systematically links them to a broad range of other quantum-chemical molecular descriptors. CHAOS provides a comprehensive and consistent foundation for developing models of molecular and thermodynamic properties -- both physics-based and machine-learning approaches -- across chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science, greatly extending the possibilities and the available quantum-chemical data basis."

The first relation captures the uniform decay of function (quasi-)norms ``at infinity''. It appeared implicitly in the first author's recent work on the compactness of Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The second is a suitably localized version of the relation of almost-compact embeddings, which has been successfully used to study compactness in function spaces over measure spaces of finite measure, but becomes of no use in the case of infinite measure. Our framework is that of quasi-Banach function spaces, which need not be normable or rearrangement invariant. This level of generality leads us to introduce the notion of extremal fundamental functions associated with a (quasi-)Banach function space. We provide several concrete examples and establish an abstract compactness principle involving the new relations. Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of this principle to embeddings of inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces on $\\mathbb{R}^n$."

    "abstract": "Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of short videos on social media platforms presents unique challenges and opportunities for recommendation systems. Users exhibit diverse preferences, and the responses resulting from different strategies often conflict with one another, potentially exhibiting inverse correlations between metrics such as watch time and video view counts. Existing uplift models face limitations in handling the heterogeneous multi-treatment scenarios of short-video recommendations, often failing to effectively capture both the synergistic and individual causal effects of different strategies. Furthermore, traditional fixed-weight approaches for balancing these responses lack personalization and can result in biased decision-making. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Multi-treatment Uplift Modeling (HMUM) framework for trade-off optimization in short-video recommendations. HMUM comprises an Offline Hybrid Uplift Modeling (HUM) module, which captures the synergistic and individual effects of multiple strategies, and an Online Dynamic Decision-Making (DDM) module, which estimates the value weights of different user responses in real-time for personalized decision-making. Evaluated on two public datasets, an industrial dataset, and through online A/B experiments on the Kuaishou platform, our model demonstrated superior offline performance and significant improvements in key metrics. It is now fully deployed on the platform, benefiting hundreds of millions of users."

However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches."

We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning."

Building on prior work on nonparametric comparison of regression curves, we extend the methodology to accommodate binary response data, which is typical in psychometric applications. The proposed approach includes a new estimator of the asymptotic variance of the test statistic and derives optimal weight functions that maximise local power. Because the asymptotic distribution of the resulting test statistic is unknown, a wild bootstrap procedure is applied for inference. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates that the nonparametric approach effectively controls Type I error and achieves power comparable to the traditional logistic regression method, outperforming it in cases with multiple intersections of the underlying IRCs. The impact of bandwidth and weight specification is explored. Application to a verbal aggression dataset further illustrates the method's ability to detect subtle DIF patterns missed by parametric models. Overall, the proposed nonparametric framework provides a flexible and powerful alternative for detecting DIF, particularly in complex scenarios where traditional model-based assumptions may not be applicable."

The silicon platform offers several advantages, including significantly lower cost, CMOS compatibility, and mature fabrication processes. However, a silicon-based design for modulating thermal emission remains absent. Here, we present an all-silicon device utilising electrical control over carrier dynamics to modulate a narrowband thermal emission in the mid-infrared region. We design a silicon device exhibiting voltage-controlled narrowband thermal emission at 10 μm and confirm its performance using electromagnetic calculations.

Cutter incorporates three key strategies to enhance learning efficiency and compression quality: trajectory-level reward shaping to transform sparse trajectory returns into dense, policy-equivalent learning signals; prototype-based shaping to guide decisions using behavioral patterns from both highand low-return trajectories; and cross-agent imitation to enable safer and more transferable exploration.

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach."

Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN."

We uncover two forms of intrinsic microstructural heterogeneity: at 300 K, we reveal remarkably wide tetragonal-like domain wall regions within the nominally orthorhombic crystal structure, and, upon cooling to 100 K, a fine microstructure of orthorhombic-like stripes embedded within the tetragonal matrix emerges. This spatially resolved view directly defines the microstructural architecture of phase coexistence in this system, demonstrating how structural distortions generate intrinsic heterogeneity that shapes the balance between superconductivity and charge density wave order as constrained by the restrictive orthorhombic and tetragonal structures, offering a pathway to control correlated phenomena."

Second, for the supercritical case with $-α< σ< 0$, we establish the global existence for sufficiently small initial data and a forcing term, and we determine the critical exponent to be \\[ p_F=\\frac{Nα-2\\mathsf{s}σ}{Nα-2\\mathsf{s}(α+σ)}. \\] Finally, for this supercritical range, we prove a more robust global existence result under assumptions requiring only local smallness and controlled growth of the data."

    "abstract": "We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown very impressive capabilities in code generation across many programming languages. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs generate programs that contains syntactic errors and fail to complete the given tasks, especially for low-resource programming languages (LRPLs). In addition, high training cost makes finetuning LLMs unaffordable with constrained computational resources, further undermining the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. In this work, we propose SLMFix, a novel code generation pipeline that leverages a small language model (SLM) finetuned using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to fix syntactic errors in LLM-generated programs to improve the quality of LLM-generated programs for domain-specific languages (DSLs). In specific, we applied RL on the SLM for the program repair task using a reward calculated using both a static validator and a static semantic similarity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach across multiple DSLs, achieving more than 95% pass rate on the static validator. Notably, SLMFix brings substantial improvement to the base model and outperforms supervised finetuning approach even for 7B models on a LRPL, showing the potential of our approach as an alternative to traditional finetuning approaches."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence."

    "abstract": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the inconsistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consistency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%), generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on NaturalBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces less than 1% additional parameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adversarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

    "abstract": "The observation of multiple images from a strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) source provides the observer with a stereoscopic view of the source. This allows for a measure of its relative proper motion by comparing the induced GW Doppler shifts between the different images. In addition, if the GW source is in a dynamical environment it will be subject to an acceleration, which will show up as a time dependent Doppler shift in each individual image. In this work we quantify for the first time how a joint detection of these effects can be used to constrain the underlying dynamics and environment of the lensed GW source. We consider a range of different astrophysical environments, from massive clusters to stellar triples, and find that binary black hole (BBH) mergers in Active Galactic Nuclei disks (AGN-disks) are particularly likely to have orbital parameters that can be constrained through our considered lensing setup. Applying these methods to the upcoming catalog of cosmologically strongly lensed GW sources will open up new possibilities for probing their origin and underlying formation mechanisms."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of nonparametric instrumental variable regression with observed covariates, which we refer to as NPIV-O. Compared with standard nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV), the additional observed covariates facilitate causal identification and enables heterogeneous causal effect estimation. However, the presence of observed covariates introduces two challenges for its theoretical analysis. First, it induces a partial identity structure, which renders previous NPIV analyses - based on measures of ill-posedness, stability conditions, or link conditions - inapplicable. Second, it imposes anisotropic smoothness on the structural function. To address the first challenge, we introduce a novel Fourier measure of partial smoothing; for the second challenge, we extend the existing kernel 2SLS instrumental variable algorithm with observed covariates, termed KIV-O, to incorporate Gaussian kernel lengthscales adaptive to the anisotropic smoothness. We prove upper $L^2$-learning rates for KIV-O and the first $L^2$-minimax lower learning rates for NPIV-O. Both rates interpolate between known optimal rates of NPIV and nonparametric regression (NPR). Interestingly, we identify a gap between our upper and lower bounds, which arises from the choice of kernel lengthscales tuned to minimize a projected risk. Our theoretical analysis also applies to proximal causal inference, an emerging framework for causal effect estimation that shares the same conditional moment restriction as NPIV-O."

    "abstract": "The real area of contact governs, in part, the friction coefficient, yet its time evolution in rough viscoelastic interfaces remains incompletely understood. In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading."

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios."

    "abstract": "Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable \"black box\" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support."

    "abstract": "Jets from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes provide the unique opportunity to study similar processes in two very different mass regimes. Historically, the apparent speeds of black hole x-ray binary (BHXRBs) jets have been observed to be lower than jet speeds from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and specifically blazars. In this work, we show that selection effects could be the primary cause of the observed population differences. For the first time, it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the underlying BHXRB jet Lorentz factor distribution. We use both the Anderson-Darling test and apply nested sampling to this problem. With Bayes factors, we confirm that the Lorentz factor distribution of BHXRBs is best described with a power law, the same model that has been applied to AGN jets. For a Lorentz factor distribution following $\\rm N(Γ) \\propto Γ^b$ we find a value for the exponent of $b=-2.64_{-0.55}^{+0.46}$. This exponent is consistent with values found in AGN population studies, within $1σ$ for \\textit{Swift}-BAT and \\textit{Fermi}-LAT selected AGN. The best-fit exponent for the radio selected MOJAVE sample is just above our $2 σ$ limit. This is a remarkable agreement given the different scales at which the jets are observed. The observed slower apparent speeds in BHXRBs are largely due to the much larger inclinations in this sample. Furthermore, nested sampling confirms that $Γ_{\\rm max}$ is completely unconstrained using this method. Therefore, based on kinematics alone, BHXRB jets are broadly consistent with being just as relativistic as those from supermassive black holes."

    "abstract": "The wearable EEG device sector is advancing rapidly, enabling fast and reliable detection of brain activity for investigating brain function and pathology. However, many current EEG systems remain challenging for users with neurological conditions due to bulky wiring, lengthy skin preparation, gel-induced discomfort, risk of irritation, and high cost, all of which limit long-term monitoring. This study presents a proof-of-concept smart modular headband incorporating adjustable, replaceable embroidered electrodes for EEG acquisition. Compared with conventional devices, the smart headband reduces wiring complexity, removes the need for skin preparation, and minimizes irritation associated with gel-based electrodes. Its modular structure allows adjustable fitting without requiring multiple size options, enhancing comfort and adaptability for everyday EEG monitoring. The smart headband prototype was tested on 10 healthy university students using three behavioral tasks: (1) eyes open/closed, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual oddball paradigms. The smart headband successfully captured alpha peaks during the eyes-open/closed task (p = 0.01) and reliably recorded the event-related potentials associated with the oddball effects - the auditory P300 (p = 0.014) and the visual N170 (p = 0.013) - demonstrating an equivalent performance to a commercial sponge-based EEG cap. A user survey indicated improved comfort and usability, with participants reporting that the soft, structurally designed headband enhanced wearability relative to a conventional cap. Overall, this prototype provides a comfortable, modular, and cost-effective solution to reliable EEG monitoring in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory studies populations that change in response to an underlying game. Often, the functional form relating outcome to player attributes or strategy is complex, preventing mathematical progress. In this work, we axiomatically derive a latent space representation for pairwise, symmetric, zero-sum games by seeking a coordinate space in which the optimal training direction for an agent responding to an opponent depends only on their opponent's coordinates. The associated embedding represents the original game as a linear combination of copies of a simple game, the disc game, in a new coordinate space. In this article, we show that disc-game embedding is useful for studying learning dynamics. We demonstrate that a series of classical evolutionary processes simplify to constrained oscillator equations in the latent space. In particular, the continuous replicator equation reduces to a Hamiltonian system of coupled oscillators that exhibit Poincaré recurrence. This reduction allows exact, finite-dimensional closure when the underlying game is finite-rank, and optimal approximation otherwise. It also establishes an exact equivalence between the continuous replicator equation and adaptive dynamics in the transformed coordinates. By identifying a minimal rank representation, the disc game embedding offers numerical methods that could decouple the cost of simulation from the number of attributes used to define agents. These results generalize to metapopulation models that mix inhomogeneously, and to any time-differentiable dynamic where the rate of growth of a type, relative to its expected payout, is a nonnegative function of its frequency. We recommend disc-game embedding as an organizing paradigm for learning and selection in response to symmetric two-player zero-sum games."

    "abstract": "Rank aggregation problems aim to combine multiple individual orderings of a common set of items into a consensus ranking that best reflects the collective preferences. This paper introduces a general Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to model and solve, in an exact way, problems whose solutions are weak orders (a.k.a.\\ bucket orders). Within this framework, we consider additional relevant constraints to produce the consensus bucket order, considering configurations with a fixed number of buckets, predefined bucket sizes, top-$k$ type problems, and fairness constraints. All these formulations are developed in a general setting, allowing their application to different rank aggregation contexts. One of these problems is the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), for which we propose for the first time an exact formulation and test the variants proposed. The computational study includes, on the one hand, a comparison between the exact results obtained by our models and the heuristic methods proposed by Aledo et al.\\ (2018), and on the other hand, an additional evaluation of their performance on a representative set of instances from the PrefLib library. The results confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a solid foundation for future research on rank aggregation problems with weak orders as consensus rankings."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in continual learning ranging from architectural novelty to clever strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting most existing methods rest on a strong but unrealistic assumption the availability of labeled data throughout the learning process. In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning."

We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition."

By leveraging transfer learning from general-purpose and domain-specific models, TRECI enables stable and accurate simulations across a wide potential range using a reduced number of reference configurations. This efficiency allows the use of high-level meta-GGA functionals and rigorous surface-electrification schemes. Applied to Cu(111)/water, models trained on just one thousand configurations yield accurate molecular dynamics simulations, capturing bias-dependent solvent restructuring effects not previously reported.

    "abstract": "Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources."

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \\times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission."

In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \\leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity. The scaling limits depend only on the zero pattern within the variance profile, but not on the values of its positive entries."

While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets."

These networks often exhibit a rich interplay of meso-scale structures, such as communities, core-periphery organization, and influential hubs, which shape the complexity of scientific collaboration. The coexistence of such structures challenges traditional approaches, which typically isolate specific network patterns at the node level. We introduce a novel framework for detecting core-periphery structures at the community level. Given a reference grouping of the nodes, the method optimizes an objective function that assigns core or peripheral roles to communities by accounting for the density and strength of their inter-community connections. The node-level partition may correspond to either inferred communities or to a node-attribute classification, such as discipline or location, enabling direct interpretation of how different social or organizational groups occupy central positions in the network. The method is motivated by an application to a co-authorship network of Italian academics in three different disciplines, where it reveals a hierarchical core-periphery structure associated with institutional role, regional location, and research topics."

These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

    "abstract": "In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality. First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically. Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work."

Assume that $L$ admits a positive matrix-valued representing measure $μ$. Any finitely atomic representing measure with the smallest sum of the ranks of the matricial masses is called minimal. In this paper, we characterize the existence of a minimal representing measure that contains a prescribed atom with a prescribed rank of the corresponding mass, thereby generalizing our recent result, which addresses the same problem in the case where the moment matrix is positive definite. As a corollary, we obtain a constructive, linear-algebraic proof of the strong truncated Hamburger matrix moment problem."

    "abstract": "Taking inspiration from NMR spectroscopy, periodic irradiation schemes have recently shown remarkable performance when implemented into pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) sequences. This has prompted considerable interest in development of broadband pulsed DNP sequences utilizing such schemes. On this background, most efforts have focused on solid-state NMR like transverse spin-locked pulse sequences whose performance in DNP applications may be compromised by the broadband capabilities of the initial excitation pulse. Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T."

    "abstract": "Many real-world bandit problems involve non-stationary reward distributions, where the optimal decision may shift due to evolving environments. However, the performance of some typical Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms degrades significantly in non-stationary environments where reward distributions change over time. To address this limitation, this paper introduces and evaluates FDSW-UCB, a novel dual-view algorithm that integrates a discount-based long-term perspective with a sliding-window-based short-term view. A data-driven semi-synthetic simulation platform, built upon the MovieLens-1M and Open Bandit datasets, is developed to test algorithm adaptability under abrupt and gradual drift scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that a well-configured sliding-window mechanism (SW-UCB) is robust, while the widely used discounting method (D-UCB) suffers from a fundamental learning failure, leading to linear regret. Crucially, the proposed FDSW-UCB, when employing an optimistic aggregation strategy, achieves superior performance in dynamic settings, highlighting that the ensemble strategy itself is a decisive factor for success."

Methods: A 46 mT Halbach scanner located at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology (Uganda) was upgraded through a complete reorganization of grounding and shielding, installation of new control electronics and open-source user-interface software. Noise performance was quantified using a standardized protocol and in-vivo brain images were acquired with three-dimensional RARE sequences. Distortion correction was implemented using cloud-based reconstructions incorporating magnetic field maps. Results: The revamped system reached noise levels routinely below three times the thermal limit and demonstrated stable operation over multi-day measurements. Three-dimensional T1- and T2-weighted brain images were successfully acquired and distortion-corrected with remote GPU-based reconstructions and near real-time visualization through the user interface. Conclusions: The results show that low-cost MRI systems can achieve clinically relevant image quality when electromagnetic noise and power-grid instabilities are properly addressed. This work highlights the feasibility of sustainable MRI development in low-resource settings and identifies stable power delivery and local capacity building as the key next steps toward clinical translation."

Recently, we introduced a hybrid method, QM-GF, that enables an accurate description of both interfacial chemistry and phononic dissipation in semi-infinite bulks. In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile."

In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques."

The load is modeled using Darcy's law with an added drainage term. A 2D soft arm unit is optimized by formulating it as a compliant mechanism design problem using the robust formulation. The problem is posed as a min-max optimization, where the output deformations of blueprint and eroded designs are considered. A volume constraint is imposed on the blueprint part, while a strain-energy constraint is enforced on the eroded part. The MMA is employed to solve the optimization problem and obtain the optimized soft unit. Finite element analysis with the Ogden material model confirms that the optimized 2D unit outperforms a conventional rectangular design under pneumatic loading. The optimized 2D unit is extruded to obtain a 3D module, and ten such units are assembled to create a soft arm. Deformation profiles of the optimized arm are analysed under different pressure loads. Four arms are 3D-printed and integrated with a supporting structure to realize the proposed SPG. The gripping performance of the SPG is demonstrated on objects with different weights, sizes, stiffness, and shapes."

We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer. Our approach outperforms the current state of the art for composed scenes in terms of VRAM usage and image quality, utilizing a combination of our instanced rasterizer and occlusion culling MLP, and exhibits complementary properties to existing LoD techniques."

However, it is still challenging to exert high actuation forces on the small robots over a large distance. Permanent magnets offer stronger magnetic torques and forces than electromagnetic coils, however, feedback control is more difficult. As proven by Earnshaw's theorem, it is not possible to achieve a stable magnetic trap in 3D by static permanent magnets. Here, we report a stable 2D magnetic force trap by an array of permanent magnets to control a millirobot. The trap is located in an open space with a tunable distance to the magnet array in the range of 20 - 120mm, which is relevant to human anatomical scales. The design is achieved by a novel GPU-accelerated optimization algorithm that uses mean squared error (MSE) and Adam optimizer to efficiently compute the optimal angles for any number of magnets in the array. The algorithm is verified using numerical simulation and physical experiments with an array of two magnets. A millirobot is successfully trapped and controlled to follow a complex trajectory. The algorithm demonstrates high scalability by optimizing the angles for 100 magnets in under three seconds. Moreover, the optimization workflow can be adapted to optimize a permanent magnet array to achieve the desired force vector fields."

The obtained energies are compared with numerical values found by applying the variational approach utilizing the universal Gaussian basis. It is found that the wave functions of the ground and higher-energy states for systems with quartic dispersion have nodes in the classically forbidden region. Thus, the well-known oscillation theorem for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is not, in general, applicable for systems with quartic dispersion. Still it is observed that the oscillation theorem holds in the classically allowed region in all considered examples. The properties of bound state wave functions are compared with the solutions of the exactly solvable problem of a square well potential."

However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines."

Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters. This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints."

However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices."

To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs."

Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter."

The proposed approach addresses the key challenges of model scalability and partial observability by integrating data-driven reduced order modelling, control in a latent space, and state estimation within a unified formulation. A predictive model is constructed via Operator Inference on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition basis, yielding a compact latent representation that captures the dominant system dynamics. State estimation is achieved through an Unscented Kalman Filter, which reconstructs the latent space from sparse and noisy measurements, enabling closed-loop control. The input signals are computed directly in the reduced-order latent space, improving computational efficiency with negligible impact on predictive capability. The methodology is validated on the one- and two-dimensional Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equations, serving as benchmarks for chaotic and spatially-extended systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate stabilisation. Overall, the framework provides a practical approach for nonlinear control of complex, high-dimensional systems where full-state measurements are often inaccessible or infeasible."

The addition of $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $φ_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_μ$, and lepton flavor violation.

This leads to emergent dynamical phenomena that do not have analogs in the well-studied case of $D=2$. Further, the larger number of internal parameters allows for the exploration of different forms of heterogeneity among the individual oscillators. When rotational symmetry is preserved there can be various forms of synchronization as well as multistability and $partial$ amplitude death, namely, the quenching of oscillations within a subset of variables that asymptote to the same constant value. The oscillatory dynamics in these cases are characterized by phase-locking and phase-drift. When the coupling breaks rotational symmetry we observe $partial$ synchronization (when a subset of the variables coincide and oscillate) and $partial$ oscillation death (when a subset of variables asymptote to different stationary values), as well as the coexistence of these different partial quenching phenomena."

Using this layer, AE Preferred Terms can be regrouped automatically into similarity clusters, and their association to the trial disease may be quantified. The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection. Applied to three legacy trials, the automated method clearly recovers all expected safety signals. Overall, augmenting MedDRA with a medical knowledge layer improves clarity, efficiency, and accuracy in AE interpretation for clinical trials."

    "abstract": "The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks.

Due to their vital role in the DL ecosystem, ensuring their reliability and security is critical. However, existing approaches have limitations in testing optimization stages, which is the core functionality of DL compilers, due to the difficulty in generating optimization-aware tests. In this paper, we proposed OATest, a novel approach for synthesizing optimization-aware computational graphs. The approach combines patterns extracted from documented tests for optimization and incorporates them into seed computational graphs, enabling broader exploration of optimization paths. To guarantee the optimization-awareness of generated graphs, OATest introduces the edges reusing strategy to establish strong connections between patterns and contexts. Additionally, to solve the validity challenge for the generated graphs, OATest employs an auxiliary layers addition strategy to resolve broken constraints. Equipped with two distinct test oracles, OATest applies differential testing to evaluate the two widely used DL compilers (i.e., TVM and ONNXRuntime). Our experimental results show that OATest outperforms the state-of-the-art method by detecting more bugs and achieving higher code coverage in TVM and ONNXRutimes. Additionally, OATest uncovers 58 previously unknown bugs, 36 of which have been confirmed or fixed by developers."

This framework enables rapid estimation of device-level metrics, including heat-flux density and effective thermal conductivity.

Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low."

We further propose an observability-driven, two-stage initialization scheme that balances accuracy with initialization latency. Extensive experiments on the EuRoC dataset validate our assumptions: our method achieves 10-20% lower initialization error than optimization-based approaches, while using 4x shorter initialization windows and reducing computational cost by 5x."

We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components. Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour. Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B."

While numerous studies have investigated these solutions, existing algorithms can only compute them in specific rings: rational functions, power series, Puiseux series, or Hahn series. This paper solves the problem by providing an algorithm that computes a complete basis of solutions for any Mahler equation, along with a decomposition of each solution over the field of Puiseux series.

While this approach reduces costs through resource consolidation, its synchronous execution imposes a computational coupling that prevents concurrent inference and training. In this study, we are returning to the strategy of separating inference and training deployment, and by introducing improvements in the data loader, we transform the conventional synchronous architecture into a periodically asynchronous framework, which allows for demand-driven, independent, and elastic scaling of each component, while the accuracy of the algorithm remains completely equivalent to the synchronization method, with both belonging to the on-policy strategy. It is worth emphasizing that we apply a unified tri-model architecture in the training phase, and we also proposed a shared-prompt attention mask to reduce repetitive computation. In practice, these works have achieved at least a threefold overall performance improvement in RL training on NPU platforms, indicating its potential for widespread application."

In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density. The model predictions are also compared with the results of the $Λ$CDM standard paradigm. Our results indicate that the Schrödinger $f(Q,T)$ type theory can give a good description of the observational data for both the very early and the late Universe."

While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10."

To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks.

Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released."

For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication."

    "abstract": "We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct \"key-information-missing\" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception."

It is particularly significant in topological data analysis, which aims to make statistical inference from a topological perspective. In this work, we introduce a new topological summary for Bayesian neural networks, termed the predictive topological uncertainty (pTU). The proposed pTU measures the uncertainty in the interaction between the model and the inputs. It provides insights from the model perspective: if two samples interact with a model in a similar way, then they are considered identically distributed. We also show that the pTU is insensitive to the model architecture. As an application, pTU is used to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, which is critical to ensure model reliability. Failure to detect OOD input can lead to incorrect and unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a significance test for OOD based on the pTU, providing a statistical framework for this issue. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through various experiments, in terms of its statistical power, sensitivity, and robustness."

    "abstract": "Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models reformulate vision-language models by tuning them with millions of robotic demonstrations. While they perform well when fine-tuned for a single embodiment or task family, extending them to multi-skill settings remains challenging: directly merging VLA experts trained on different tasks results in near-zero success rates. This raises a fundamental question: what prevents VLAs from mastering multiple skills within one model? With an empirical decomposition of learnable parameters during VLA fine-tuning, we identify two key sources of non-mergeability: (1) Finetuning drives LoRA adapters in the VLM backbone toward divergent, task-specific directions beyond the capacity of existing merging methods to unify. (2) Action experts develop inter-block dependencies through self-attention feedback, causing task information to spread across layers and preventing modular recombination. To address these challenges, we present MergeVLA, a merging-oriented VLA architecture that preserves mergeability by design. MergeVLA introduces sparsely activated LoRA adapters via task masks to retain consistent parameters and reduce irreconcilable conflicts in the VLM. Its action expert replaces self-attention with cross-attention-only blocks to keep specialization localized and composable. When the task is unknown, it uses a test-time task router to adaptively select the appropriate task mask and expert head from the initial observation, enabling unsupervised task inference. Across LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, RoboTwin, and multi-task experiments on the real SO101 robotic arm, MergeVLA achieves performance comparable to or even exceeding individually finetuned experts, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks, embodiments, and environments."

Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

    "abstract": "We apply quantum distributional compositional circuit (QDisCoCirc) to 3-class sentiment analysis of financial text. In our classical simulations, we keep the Hilbert-space dimension manageable by decomposing each sentence into short contiguous chunks. Each chunk is mapped to a shallow quantum circuit, and the resulting Bloch vectors are used as a sequence of quantum tokens. Simple averaging of chunk vectors ignores word order and syntactic roles. We therefore add a small Transformer encoder over the raw Bloch-vector sequence and attach a CCG-based type embedding to each chunk. This hybrid design preserves physically interpretable semantic axes of quantum tokens while allowing the classical side to model word order and long-range dependencies. The sequence model improves test macro-F1 over the averaging baseline and chunk-level attribution further shows that evidential mass concentrates on a small number of chunks, that type embeddings are used more reliably for correctly predicted sentences. For real-world quantum language processing applications in finance, future key challenges include circuit designs that avoid chunking and the design of inter-chunk fusion layers."

The beads are self-propelled in this medium by means of self-thermophoresis resulting from local heating as a result of light absorption by their carbon cap. Within a certain laser power range, we find that these particles exhibit a quasi-two-dimensional active motion near a solid surface with stochastic rotational reversals when propelling themselves away from the region of maximum intensity, which leads to a stable trapping with oscillatory-like behavior inside the illuminated region. The orientation autocorrelation function of this type of confined active motion displays damped oscillations whose characteristic frequency increases with increasing propulsion speed, thus resulting in four regimes of translational motion depending on the observation time scale: thermal diffusion, ballistic motion, oscillatory behavior, and confinement. Our experimental findings are well described by a minimal phenomenological model that includes the nonlinear effect of a torque that reorients the particle toward the center of the optical confinement, which in combination with rotational diffusion gives rise to the observed orientational changes that allow their oscillatory trapping inside the light field. We also show that a similar active trapping mechanism emerges in the case of Janus colloidal rods, even though the periodicity is hindered by their three-dimensional rotation in the laser beam."

To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a \"part-wise\" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications."

Existing pipelines rely on incompatible assumptions: static and in-the-wild methods enforce a single geometry, while dynamic ones assume smooth motion, both failing under long-term, discontinuous changes. To solve this problem, we introduce ChronoGS, a temporally modulated Gaussian representation that reconstructs all periods within a unified anchor scaffold. It's also designed to disentangle stable and evolving components, achieving temporally consistent reconstruction of multi-period scenes. To catalyze relevant research, we release ChronoScene dataset, a benchmark of real and synthetic multi-period scenes, capturing geometric and appearance variation.

The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency."

WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter on a 1.1-day orbit around a slightly evolved F-type star. Its observed orbital decay rate, $|\\dot{P}_{\\rm orb}/P_{\\rm orb}| \\approx 3.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, provides a strong constraint on stellar tidal dissipation. We confirm that linear tides with radiative damping and convective damping, as currently implemented, are not sufficient to reproduce the observed inspiral timescale. Nevertheless, our calculations, based on fully non-adiabatic forced oscillations in MESA stellar models with convective envelopes, yield dissipation rates that are consistent with previous semi-analytic and adiabatic estimates, confirming the robustness of our numerical framework. As the only open-source, actively maintained tool capable of computing orbital evolution in exoplanet systems, GYRE-tides provides a benchmark calculation for WASP-12 and future applications. Our results validate GYRE-tides as a tool for analyzing combined radiative and convective damping, and indicate that the observed decay rate requires tidal dissipation operating in or near the fully damped regime, which may be achieved through nonlinear damping. These contributions could also be evaluated by computing the wave luminosity at the radiative-convective boundary using our tool. GYRE-tides offers an open-source framework for computing tidal dissipation in short-period exoplanet systems, including the many systems expected to show orbital decay in upcoming Roman surveys."

Communication (i.e., ``\\textit{Tell}'') can assist in the cognitive development process by information dissemination, yet it is inevitably subject to real-world constraints such as noise, latency, and attacks. Therefore, building the understanding of teammates' decisions without communication remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel non-communication MARL framework that realizes the construction of cognition through local observation-based modeling (i.e., \\textit{``Think''}). Our framework enables agents to model teammates' \\textbf{active inference} process. At first, the proposed method produces three teammate portraits: perception-belief-action. Specifically, we model the teammate's decision process as follows: 1) Perception: observing environments; 2) Belief: forming beliefs; 3) Action: making decisions. Then, we selectively integrate the belief portrait into the decision process based on the accuracy and relevance of the perception portrait. This enables the selection of cooperative teammates and facilitates effective collaboration. Extensive experiments on the SMAC, SMACv2, MPE, and GRF benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method."

Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events."

    "abstract": "In stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs), interventions are sequentially rolled out to clusters over multiple periods. It is common practice to analyze SW-CRTs using discrete-time linear mixed models, in which measurements are considered to be taken at discrete time points. However, a recent systematic review found that 95.1\\% of cross-sectional SW-CRTs recruit individuals continuously over time. Despite the high prevalence of designs with continuous recruitment, there has been limited guidance on how to draw model-robust inference when analyzing such SW-CRTs. In this article, we investigate through simulations the implications of using discrete-time linear mixed models in the case of continuous recruitment designs with a continuous outcome. First, in the data-generating process, we characterize continuous recruitment with a continuous-time exponential decay correlation structure in the presence or absence of a continuous period effect, addressing scenarios both with and without a random or exposure-time-dependent intervention effect. Then, we analyze the simulated data under three popular discrete-time working correlation structures: simple exchangeable, nested exchangeable, and discrete-time exponential decay, with a robust sandwich variance estimator. Our results demonstrate that discrete-time analysis often yields minimum bias, and the robust variance estimator with the Mancl and DeRouen correction consistently achieves nominal coverage and type I error rate. One important exception occurs when recruitment patterns vary systematically between control and intervention periods, where discrete-time analysis leads to slightly biased estimates. Finally, we illustrate these findings by reanalyzing a concluded SW-CRT."

Accurately forecasting the total number of each action that each player will complete during a match is desirable for a variety of applications, including tactical decision-making, sports betting, and for television broadcast commentary and analysis. Such predictions must consider the game state, the ability and skill of the players in both teams, the interactions between the players, and the temporal dynamics of the game as it develops. In this paper, we present a transformer-based neural network that jointly and recurrently predicts the expected totals for thirteen individual actions at multiple time-steps during the match, and where predictions are made for each individual player, each team and at the game-level. The neural network is based on an \\emph{axial transformer} that efficiently captures the temporal dynamics as the game progresses, and the interactions between the players at each time-step. We present a novel axial transformer design that we show is equivalent to a regular sequential transformer, and the design performs well experimentally.

    "abstract": "Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded."

We propose a solution that leverages foundation models to simplify surface selection for manipulator-based UV disinfection, reducing human involvement and removing the need for model training.

    "abstract": "General Visual Inspection is a manual inspection process regularly used to detect and localise obvious damage on the exterior of commercial aircraft. There has been increasing demand to perform this process at the boarding gate to minimise the downtime of the aircraft and automating this process is desired to reduce the reliance on human labour. Automating this typically requires estimating a camera's pose with respect to the aircraft for initialisation but most existing localisation methods require infrastructure, which is very challenging in uncontrolled outdoor environments and within the limited turnover time (approximately 2 hours) on an airport tarmac. Additionally, many airlines and airports do not allow contact with the aircraft's surface or using UAVs for inspection between flights, and restrict access to commercial aircraft. Hence, this paper proposes an on-site method that is infrastructure-free and easy to deploy for estimating a pan-tilt-zoom camera's pose and localising scan images. This method initialises using the same pan-tilt-zoom camera used for the inspection task by utilising a Deep Convolutional Neural Network fine-tuned on only synthetic images to predict its own pose. We apply domain randomisation to generate the dataset for fine-tuning the network and modify its loss function by leveraging aircraft geometry to improve accuracy. We also propose a workflow for initialisation, scan path planning, and precise localisation of images captured from a pan-tilt-zoom camera. We evaluate and demonstrate our approach through experiments with real aircraft, achieving root-mean-square camera pose estimation errors of less than 0.24 m and 2 degrees for all real scenes."

To validate the detector concept and ensure technical reliability for the full-scale experiment, a dedicated prototype was designed, constructed, and operated. This work presents an overview of the design, construction, and operational performance of the prototype, with emphasis on its major subsystems, including the TPC, cryogenic and xenon purification systems, slow control, and data acquisition. During operation, the detector demonstrated the capability to achieve a sub-keV energy threshold required for the RELICS physics program, as reflected by a measured single electron gain of 34.30~$\\pm$~0.01~(stat.)~PE/e$^-$ and the successful detection of 0.27~keV L-shell decay events from $^{37}$Ar. In addition, essential data analysis techniques and simulation frameworks were developed and validated, establishing the methodological foundation for future RELICS operations. The successful construction and operation of this prototype confirm the feasibility of the core technologies and provide a crucial experimental basis for the final RELICS detector."

    "abstract": "NVIDIA Encoder (NVENC) features in modern NVIDIA GPUs, offer significant advantages over software encoders by providing comparable Rate-Distortion (RD) performance while consuming considerably less power. The increasing capability of consumer devices to capture footage in Ultra High-Definition (UHD) at 4K and 8K resolutions necessitates high-performance video transcoders for internet-based delivery. To address this demand, NVIDIA introduced Split-Frame Encoding (SFE), a technique that leverages multiple on-die NVENC chips available in high-end GPUs. SFE splits a single UHD frame for parallel encoding across these physical encoders and subsequently stitches the results, which significantly improves encoding throughput. However, this approach is known to incur an RD performance penalty. The widespread adoption of NVIDIA GPUs in data centers, driven by the rise of Generative AI, means NVENC is poised to play a critical role in transcoding UHD video. To better understand the performance-efficiency tradeoff of SFE, this paper evaluates SFE's impact on RD performance, encoding throughput, power consumption, and end-to-end latency using standardized test sequences. The results show that for real-time applications, SFE nearly doubles encoding throughput with a negligible RD performance penalty, which enables the use of higher-quality presets for 4K and makes real-time 8K encoding feasible, effectively offsetting the minor RD penalty. Moreover, SFE adds no latency at 4K and can reduce it at 8K, positioning it as a key enabler for high-throughput, real-time UHD transcoding."

Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated."

Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models."

Numerical evaluations show that optimizing element placement in FRIS significantly improves SOP compared to conventional RIS without phase adaptation. However, these improvements become less evident once the conventional RIS implements optimized beamforming (BF) and phase-shift (PS) controlling. In addition, FRIS maintains a clear advantage over compact RIS designs with optimized BF and PS, mainly due to its lower spatial correlation. Results further indicate that reducing the inter-element distance negatively impacts SOP, highlighting the importance of spatial diversity."

Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving."

To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality.

To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\\rm peak} \\sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \\approx 2\\times10^4~{\\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys."

However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision.

Statistical analysis demonstrates that: (i) spatial position optimization in FRIS provides noticeable gains over conventional RIS in the absence of phase-shift design; (ii) such benefits vanish when FRIS and conventional RIS employ optimal beamforming (BF) and phase shift (PS) design, making position optimization irrelevant; (iii) FRIS consistently outperforms compact RIS with optimized BF and PS design, owing to spatial correlation and smaller aperture."

Prior CMU typically assumes access to identified corrupted training samples (a ``forget set''). However, in many real-world scenarios the training data are no longer accessible. We formalize \\emph{source-free} CMU, where the original training data are unavailable and, consequently, no forget set of identified corrupted training samples can be specified. Instead, we assume a small proxy (surrogate) set of corrupted samples that reflect the suspected corruption type without needing to be the original training samples. In this stricter setting, methods relying on forget set are ineffective or narrow in scope. We introduce \\textit{Corrective Unlearning in Task Space} (CUTS), a lightweight weight space correction method guided by the proxy set using task arithmetic principles. CUTS treats the clean and the corruption signal as distinct tasks. Specifically, we briefly fine-tune the corrupted model on the proxy to amplify the corruption mechanism in the weight space, compute the difference between the corrupted and fine-tuned weights as a proxy task vector, and subtract a calibrated multiple of this vector to cancel the corruption. Without access to clean data or a forget set, CUTS recovers a large fraction of the lost utility under label noise and, for backdoor triggers, nearly eliminates the attack with minimal damage to utility, outperforming state-of-the-art specialized CMU methods in source-free setting."

To address this limitation, we propose a Torsion-Space Diffusion Model that generates protein backbones by denoising torsion angles, ensuring perfect local geometry by construction. A differentiable forward-kinematics module reconstructs 3D coordinates with fixed 3.8 Angstrom backbone bond lengths while a constrained post-processing refinement optimizes global compactness via Radius of Gyration (Rg) correction, without violating bond constraints. Experiments on standard PDB proteins demonstrate 100% bond-length accuracy and significantly improved structural compactness, reducing Rg error from 70% to 18.6% compared to Cartesian diffusion baselines. Overall, this hybrid torsion-diffusion plus geometric-refinement framework generates physically valid and compact protein backbones, providing a promising path toward full-atom protein generation."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive"

This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $>99.5\\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \\textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1σ$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \\textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \\textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data."

    "abstract": "Recipe recommendation has become an essential task in web-based food platforms. A central challenge is effectively leveraging rich multimodal features beyond user-recipe interactions. Our analysis shows that even simple uses of multimodal signals yield competitive performance, suggesting that systematic enhancement of these signals is highly promising. We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10."

    "abstract": "Research on the safety evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has become extensive, driven by jailbreak studies that elicit unsafe responses. Such response involves information already available to humans, such as the answer to \"how to make a bomb\". When LLMs are jailbroken, the practical threat they pose to humans is negligible. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs commonly produce unpredictable outputs that could pose substantive threats to human safety. To address this gap, we study whether LLM-generated content contains potential existential threats, defined as outputs that imply or promote direct harm to human survival. We propose \\textsc{ExistBench}, a benchmark designed to evaluate such risks. Each sample in \\textsc{ExistBench} is derived from scenarios where humans are positioned as adversaries to AI assistants. Unlike existing evaluations, we use prefix completion to bypass model safeguards. This leads the LLMs to generate suffixes that express hostility toward humans or actions with severe threat, such as the execution of a nuclear strike. Our experiments on 10 LLMs reveal that LLM-generated content indicates existential threats. To investigate the underlying causes, we also analyze the attention logits from LLMs. To highlight real-world safety risks, we further develop a framework to assess model behavior in tool-calling. We find that LLMs actively select and invoke external tools with existential threats. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/cuiyu-ai/ExistBench."

While recent advancements, such as the RAVEN model, have improved coarse-grained violation detection, critical gaps persist in fine-grained understanding, explainability, and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose RAVEN++, a novel framework that introduces three key innovations: 1) Active Reinforcement Learning (RL), which dynamically adapts training to samples of varying difficulty; 2) Fine-Grained Violation Understanding, achieved through hierarchical reward functions and reasoning distillation; and 3) Progressive Multi-Stage Training, which systematically combines knowledge injection, curriculum-based passive RL, and active RL. Extensive experiments on both public and proprietary datasets, on both offline scenarios and online deployed A/B Testing, demonstrate that RAVEN++ outperforms general-purpose LLMs and specialized models like RAVEN in terms of fine-grained violation understanding, reasoning capabilities, and generalization ability."

    "abstract": "Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for generative modeling over discrete domains. It is known that MDMs effectively train to decode tokens in a random order, and that this ordering has significant performance implications in practice. This observation raises a fundamental question: can we design a training framework that optimizes for a favorable decoding order? We answer this in the affirmative, showing that the continuous-time variational objective of MDMs, when equipped with multivariate noise schedules, can identify and optimize for a decoding order during training. We establish a direct correspondence between decoding order and the multivariate noise schedule and show that this setting breaks invariance of the MDM objective to the noise schedule. Furthermore, we prove that the MDM objective decomposes precisely into a weighted auto-regressive losses over these orders, which establishes them as auto-regressive models with learnable orders."

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks inherit their chemical composition from their natal molecular cloud, but the extent to which this material is preserved versus reset through chemical reprocessing remains an open question. Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk."

    "abstract": "A well-known testing method for the safety evaluation and real-time validation of automotive software systems (ASSs) is Fault Injection (FI). In accordance with the ISO 26262 standard, the faults are introduced artificially for the purpose of analyzing the safety properties and verifying the safety mechanisms during the development phase. However, the current FI method and tools have a significant limitation in that they require manual identification of FI attributes, including fault type, location and time. The more complex the system, the more expensive, time-consuming and labour-intensive the process. To address the aforementioned challenge, a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted fault test cases (TCs) generation approach for utilization during real-time FI tests is proposed in this paper. To this end, considering the representativeness and coverage criteria, the applicability of various LLMs to create fault TCs from the functional safety requirements (FSRs) has been investigated. Through the validation results of LLMs, the superiority of the proposed approach utilizing gpt-4o in comparison to other state-of-the-art models has been demonstrated. Specifically, the proposed approach exhibits high performance in terms of FSRs classification and fault TCs generation with F1-score of 88% and 97.5%, respectively. To illustrate the proposed approach, the generated fault TCs were executed in real time on a hardware-in-the-loop system, where a high-fidelity automotive system model served as a case study. This novel approach offers a means of optimizing the real-time testing process, thereby reducing costs while simultaneously enhancing the safety properties of complex safety-critical ASSs."

We develop a quantum cascade approach that enables a time-resolved description of a single-photon wave packet impinging on the cavity. We make use of a simple model of charge detector to assess the efficiency of our photo-detection configuration as functions of key parameters such as coupling strength, tunneling rate, temperature, and photon resonance linewidth. We finally highlight a measurement-induced backaction effect on the cavity mode associated with the dispersive, non-absorptive detection process."

We introduce Simple Chat, an open-source, research-focused chat interface that streamlines LLM integration for platforms such as Qualtrics, oTree, and LimeSurvey, while presenting a unified participant experience across conditions. Simple Chat connects to both commercial providers and open-weights models, supports streaming responses to preserve conversational flow, and offers an administrative interface for fine-grained control of prompts and interface features. By reducing technical barriers, standardizing interfaces, and improving participant experience, Simple Chat helps advance the study of human-LLM interaction.

This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA."

Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems."

Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases.

However, current ISO/TS-15066-compliant implementations often limit the efficiency of collaborative tasks due to conservative speed restrictions. For this reason, this paper introduces a deep-learning-based human-robot-safety framework (HRSF) that aims at a dynamical adaptation of robot velocities depending on the separation distance between human and robot while respecting maximum biomechanical force and pressure limits. The applicability of the framework was investigated for four different deep learning approaches that can be used for human body extraction: human body recognition, human body segmentation, human pose estimation, and human body part segmentation. Unlike conventional industrial safety systems, the proposed HRSF differentiates individual human body parts from other objects, enabling optimized robot process execution. Experiments demonstrated a quantitative reduction in cycle time of up to 15% compared to conventional safety technology."

    "abstract": "Modern genomic analyses increasingly rely on pangenomes, that is, representations of the genome of entire populations. The simplest representation of a pangenome is a set of individual genome sequences. Compared to e.g. sequence graphs, this has the advantage that efficient exact search via indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is possible, that no chimeric sequences are created, and that the results are not influenced by heuristics. However, such an index may report a match in thousands of positions even if these all correspond to the same locus, making downstream analysis unnecessarily expensive. For sufficiently similar sequences (e.g. human chromosomes), a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) can be computed. Since an MSA tends to group similar strings in the same columns, it is likely that a string occurring thousands of times in the pangenome can be described by very few columns in the MSA. We describe a method to tag entries in the BWT with the corresponding column in the MSA and develop an index that can map matches in the BWT to columns in the MSA in time proportional to the output. As a by-product, we can efficiently project a match to a designated reference genome, a capability that current pangenome aligners based on the BWT lack."

    "abstract": "In Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL), the central server immediately updates the global model with each arriving client's contribution. As a result, clients perform their local training on different model versions, causing information staleness (delay). In federated environments with non-IID local data distributions, this asynchronous pattern amplifies the adverse effect of client heterogeneity (due to different data distribution, local objectives, etc.), as faster clients contribute more frequent updates, biasing the global model. We term this phenomenon heterogeneity amplification. Our work provides a theoretical analysis that maps AFL design choices to their resulting error sources when heterogeneity amplification occurs. Guided by our analysis, we propose ACE (All-Client Engagement AFL), which mitigates participation imbalance through immediate, non-buffered updates that use the latest information available from all clients. We also introduce a delay-aware variant, ACED, to balance client diversity against update staleness. Experiments on different models for different tasks across diverse heterogeneity and delay settings validate our analysis and demonstrate the robust performance of our approaches."

First, we set up an expression form \"Effect of Contradictory Structure.\" \"Effect of Contradictory Structure\" is not static but dynamic. Effect in \"Effect of Contradictory Structure\" is unpleasant or pleasant, and the orientation to avoid that unpleasantness is considered pseudo-expression of will. Second, \"Effect of Contradictory Structure\" can be overlapped with each other. This overlapping operation is called \"montage.\" A broader \"Structure\" that includes related \"Effect of Contradictory Structure\" and \"Effect of Structure\" are set up. Montage produces \"Effect of Structure\". In montage, it is necessary to set something like \"strength,\" so we adopted Deleuze and Deleuze/Guattari's word \"intensity\" and set it as an element of our model. We set up a general theoretical framework - Word Import Between Systems (Models) and justified the import of \"intensity\" through Austin's use of the word \"force.\" \"Effect of Structure\" process is demonstrated using the example of proceeding to the next level of education."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure presents significant planning challenges, requiring efficient strategies for investment and operation to deliver cost-effective charging services. However, the potential benefits of EV charging assignment, particularly in response to varying spatial-temporal patterns of charging demand, remain under-explored in infrastructure planning. This paper proposes an integrated approach that jointly optimizes investment decisions and charging assignments while accounting for spatial-temporal demand dynamics and their interdependencies. To support efficient model development, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to assist in generating and refining the mathematical formulation from structured natural-language descriptions, significantly reducing the modeling burden. The resulting optimization model enables optimal joint decision-making for investment and operation. Additionally, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address computational complexity in high-dimensional scenarios, which can be executed on standard computing platforms. We validate our approach through a case study using 1.5 million real-world travel records from Chengdu, China, demonstrating a 30% reduction in total cost compared to a baseline without EV assignment."

However, the initial results obtained from ISAC systems are coarse and often unsatisfactory due to the high sparsity of the point clouds and significant noise variance. To address this problem, we propose a noise-sparsity-aware diffusion model (NSADM) post-processing framework. Leveraging the powerful data recovery capabilities of diffusion models, the proposed scheme exploits spatial features and the additive nature of noise to enhance point cloud density and denoise the initial input. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing model-based and deep learning-based approaches in terms of Chamfer distance and root mean square error."

While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones."

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed."

These transients are rare, and increasing the current sample is paramount to understand them. As part of the Fink alert broker, we have developed an early detection system for TDEs for the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. In this paper, we report on the optical transients we found either during the development of this tool, or when applying the classifier to the existing archive. We use this sample to anticipate what improvements to the TDE detection systems will need to be implemented for future surveys. For all the transients, we present optical and infrared archival photometry from ZTF, WISE, and Catalina, and assess the previous nuclear activity of the host. We fit the ZTF lightcurves with both a phenomenological and a physically-motivated model. We report on a total of 19 optical nuclear transients, out of which nine are in passive galaxies, eight in active galaxies, and two for which the activity of the host is uncertain. Two transients are newly discovered repeated TDE candidates, and we compare them to the current sample of repeated optical nuclear transients. One transient is exceptionally long-lived (over 5 years), in an until-now passive galaxy. Three of the TDE-like flares in active galaxies have absolute g-band magnitudes brighter than -24, making them new Extreme Nuclear Transient (ENT) candidates. One seemingly repeated object was revealed to be two independent supernovae in the same galaxy. This sample shows both the potential of our detection system for future discovery, and the relevance of archival searches to reveal overlooked transients. It also raises several points of concern and avenues of improvement for current and future classifiers."

    "abstract": "Transmission spectroscopy of sub-Neptunes was expected to reveal their compositions and hence origins, yet many show flat near- to mid-infrared spectra. Such spectra can be explained either by metal dominated atmospheres or by high-altitude, grey aerosols. Observations of escaping hydrogen and helium from several of these planets rule out metal dominated atmospheres, while homogeneous distributions of small aerosols cannot produce flat spectra and large particles require unphysically high production rates. We investigate the role of heterogeneous, \"clumpy\" aerosol distributions in shaping transmission spectra. Modestly optically thick clumps at high altitudes can produce flat spectra even with small particles and physically realistic production rates. Clumping increases the effective photon mean-free path while reducing wavelength dependence, allowing the aerosol distribution to behave as an effective grey absorber. Applying this framework to the sub-Neptune TOI-776c, we show that clumpy aerosols can reconcile the observed flattening of its transmission spectrum with a primordial H/He-dominated atmosphere. We further discuss implications for emission spectra, where enhanced stellar radiation penetration and altered scattering in a clumpy medium could produce observable signatures. These results suggest that clumpy aerosol distributions naturally resolve the tension between flat spectra and low-metallicity atmospheres and may be a common feature of sub-Neptune exoplanets. More broadly, our results highlight the need to consider aerosol heterogeneity when interpreting high-altitude microphysics and the spectral appearance of exoplanet atmospheres with JWST, and motivate theoretical work to identify the physical mechanisms capable of generating clumpy aerosol distributions."

Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments."

While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency."

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability."

However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods."

    "abstract": "X-chromosome association study has specific model uncertainty challenges, such as unknown X-chromosome inactivation status and baseline allele, and considering nonadditive and gene-sex interaction effects in the analysis or not. Although these challenges have been answered for single-locus X-chromosome variants, it remains unclear how to properly perform multilocus association studies when above uncertainties are present. We first carefully investigate the inferential consequences of these uncertainties on existing multilocus association analysis methods, and then propose a theoretically justified framework to analyze multilocus X-chromosome variants while all the uncertainty issues are addressed. We provide separate solutions for common and rare variants, and simulation results show that our solutions are overall more powerful than existing multilocus methods which were proposed to analyze autosomal variants. We finally provide supporting evidences of our approach by revisiting some published X-chromosome association studies."

    "abstract": "Standard Virtual Element Methods (VEM) are based on polynomial projections and require a stabilization term to evaluate the contribution of the non-polynomial component of the discrete space. However, the stabilization term does not generally conform to the physics of the considered problem and a criterion for its choice is not typically supported by theoretical arguments. Hence, stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed. Moreover, the accuracy of VEM deteriorates in case of problems with variable coefficients, that are not usually accounted when constructing polynomial projections. The mentioned aspects might limit the use of the method when tackling real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy, while suffering from worse conditioning. Moreover, a new approach for dealing with variable coefficients is introduced: the discrete space is modified so that general coefficients can be accounted when computing the polynomial projectors. Numerical results show that this new approach is more robust than the standard ones."

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning."

However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested \"bubbles-within-bubbles.\" When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work."

We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \\times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande."

While at gamma-rays we can not spatially resolve the lensed images, a macrolensing-induced time pattern is expected in the blazar's lightcurve, resulting from the delay between variable gamma-ray components originating from its two brightest lensed images. Compared to our previous study, here we employ high-quality lightcurves coupled with prolonged outburst activity, and improved time-series techniques. Analyzing six independent data segments, we identified a delay of 20.26 +/- 0.62 days (statistical and stochastic uncertainty), with a chance detection probability at the 2.5 x $10^{-5}$ level (post-trial). We also present a novel approach to the magnification ratio estimate based on a comparison with simulated data. Our work suggests that the gamma-ray flux ratio between the two main lens components is $μ_γ \\lesssim$ 1.8. We do not observe convincing evidence of microlensing effects, as previously claimed. The measured gamma-ray time delay is in 2-sigma tension with radio-based estimates, suggesting either distinct emission sites, underestimated radio uncertainties, or gamma-ray production in a region opaque to radio. Our study highlights the potential of well sampled lightcurves and advanced time-series techniques to distinguish true lensing-induced delays from stochastic variability. When combined with improved radio constraints and refined lens models, PKS 1830-211 and similar sources constitute promising systems for time-delay cosmography, offering new insights into both jet structure and cosmological parameters."

A planar concentric circular microphone array constructed with MEMS microphones provides a compact, energy-efficient platform supporting 2D beam steering across azimuth and elevation. Real-time tracking outputs continuously adapt the array's focus, synchronizing the acoustic response with the target's position. By uniting learned spatial awareness with dynamic steering, the system maintains robust performance in the presence of multiple or moving sources. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant gains in signal-to-interference ratio, making the design well-suited for teleconferencing, smart home devices, and assistive technologies."

Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics."

    "abstract": "Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single \"background\" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models. In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability."

In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning Solar Cycles 1-24 (1755-2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265-year period. We modulate the active region tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r > 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265-year period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work."

    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of sheared grazing flow on acoustic propagation in three-dimensional rectangular ducts. We particularly focus on small ducts typical of most experimental impedance eduction facilities, for which the flow profile in the duct cross-section varies significantly. We assess the effect of simplifying this inherent two-dimensional flow profile to either a one-dimensional (2D duct) or uniform flow profile. Three flow profiles are considered, namely (i) the tensorised hyperbolic tangent, (ii) the law-of-the-wall, and (iii) one obtained from a RANS simulation. These flow profiles are used in numerical simulations, based on the solution of the Pridmore--Brown equation, to perform in silico impedance eduction experiments. Results show that realistic flow profiles can be approximated well in ducts by uniform or 2D-duct models provided the bulk Mach number is correctly accounted for, which contrasts with previous findings for more simplistic flow profiles. The key conclusion of this work is that if viscous effects are negligible and acoustic impedance is a good representation of a lined wall with grazing flow, then the simplification to a uniform flow is a reasonable approximation and traditional eduction methods are satisfactorily accurate."

In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent contract design has largely evaluated contracts through the lens of pure Nash equilibria (PNE). This focus, however, is not without loss: In general, the principal can strictly gain by recommending a complex, possibly correlated, distribution over actions, while preserving incentive compatibility. In this work, we extend the analysis of multi-agent contracts beyond pure Nash equilibria to encompass more general equilibrium notions, including mixed Nash equilibria as well as (coarse-)correlated equilibria (CCE). The latter, in particular, captures the limiting outcome of agents engaged in learning dynamics. Our main result shows that for submodular and, more generally, XOS rewards, such complex recommendations yield at most a constant-factor gain: there exists a contract and a PNE whose utility is within a constant factor of the best CCE achievable by any contract. This provides a black-box lifting: results established against the best PNE automatically apply with respect to the best CCE, with only a constant factor loss. For submodular rewards, we further show how to transform a contract and a PNE of that contract into a new contract such that any of its CCEs gives a constant approximation to the PNE. This yields black-box robustness: up to constant factors, guarantees established for a specific contract and PNE automatically extend to the modified contract and any of its CCEs. We thus expand prior guarantees for multi-agent contracts and lower the barrier to new ones. As an important corollary, we obtain poly-time algorithms for submodular rewards that achieve constant approximations in any CCE, against the best CCE under the best contract. Such worst-case guarantees are provably unattainable for XOS rewards. Finally, we bound the gap between different equilibrium notions for subadditive, supermodular, and general rewards."

Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques.

Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development."

    "abstract": "Clustering short text embeddings is a foundational task in natural language processing, yet remains challenging due to the need to specify the number of clusters in advance. We introduce a scalable spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy. This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrinsic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Cohesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short text data. Implementation of our estimator of k and Cohesion Ratio, along with code for reproducing the experiments, is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/towards_clustering-0C2E."

    "abstract": "RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

Notably, recent DESY5 Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data challenge the validity of the cosmological constant, and they remain in tension with SH0ES local distance ladder measurements under standard pre-recombination physics. Building on our previous work, MNRAS 523 (2023) 3, 3406-3422, we present a follow-up analysis of the model-independent calibration of the local and inverse distance ladders using cosmic chronometers (CCH) data and Gaussian Processes. We jointly constrain the SNIa absolute magnitude, $M$, the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, and the spatial curvature parameter, $Ω_k$, using CCH with DESY5 and DESI DR1/DR2. We find this data combination compatible with a flat universe at $\\sim1.7σ$, with $Ω_k=-0.143\\pm0.085$, showing weaker compatibility than with Pantheon+, while the ladder calibrators read $M=-19.324_{-0.095}^{+0.092}$ and $r_d=(144.00^{+5.38}_{-4.88}$) Mpc. Although current uncertainties limit the precision of our constraints and prevent us from arbitrating the Hubble tension, it is nevertheless instructive to explore the constraining power of our methodology with future SNIa, CCH, and BAO from surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and DESI. We present the first forecast analysis for the triad $(M,Ω_k,r_d)$, finding that, in an optimistic scenario, upcoming data will improve agnostic constraints on $M$ by $\\sim$54% and on $r_d$ by $\\sim$66%, enabling a $\\sim2$% determination of $H_0$. Precision on $Ω_k$ will increase by $\\sim50$%.

In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training."

We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods."

Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages."

Doing so leads us to a concise vocabulary of semantically-rich operations and a VLM-friendly grammar for handling diverse unseen tasks. In addition, we design a new open-vocabulary segmentation paradigm with a retrieval-augmented few-shot learning strategy to localize fine-grained object parts for manipulation, effectively with the shortest inference time over all state-of-the-art parallel works. Also, we formulate new metrics for action-generalizability and VLM-comprehensibility, demonstrating the compelling performance of SEAM over mainstream representations on both aspects. Extensive real-world experiments further manifest its SOTA performance under varying settings and tasks."

    "abstract": "Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning.

These models, referred to as genomic language mod- els (gLMs), have demonstrated impressive predictive and generative capabilities, raising concerns that such models may also enable misuse, for instance via the generation of genomes for human-infecting viruses. These concerns have catalyzed calls for risk mitigation measures. The de facto mitigation of choice is filtering of pretraining data (i.e., removing viral genomic sequences from training datasets) in order to limit gLM performance on virus-related tasks. However, it is not currently known how robust this approach is for securing open-source models that can be fine-tuned using sensitive pathogen data. Here, we evaluate a state-of-the-art gLM, Evo 2, and perform fine-tuning using sequences from 110 harmful human-infecting viruses to assess the rescue of misuse-relevant predictive capabilities. The fine- tuned model exhibited reduced perplexity on unseen viral sequences relative to 1) the pretrained model and 2) a version fine-tuned on bacteriophage sequences. The model fine-tuned on human-infecting viruses also identified immune escape variants from SARS-CoV-2 (achieving an AUROC of 0.6), despite having no expo- sure to SARS-CoV-2 sequences during fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that data exclusion might be circumvented by fine-tuning approaches that can, to some degree, rescue misuse-relevant capabilities of gLMs. We highlight the need for safety frameworks for gLMs and outline further work needed on evaluations and mitigation measures to enable the safe deployment of gLMs."

Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time.

    "abstract": "Estimating quantum entropies and divergences is an important problem in quantum physics, information theory, and machine learning. Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice."

In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves."

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale."

Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch."

Birdsongs involve rapid frequency-modulated chirps, complex amplitude envelopes, distinctive acoustic patterns, overlapping calls, and dynamic inter-bird interactions, all of which require precise temporal and spatial control in 3D environments. Existing approaches, whether Digital Signal Processing (DSP)-based or data-driven, typically focus only on single species modeling, static call structures, or synthesis directly from recordings, and often suffer from noise, limited flexibility, or large data needs. To address these challenges, we present a novel, fully algorithm-driven framework that generates dynamic multi-species bird soundscapes using DSP-based chirp generation and 3D spatialization, without relying on recordings or training data. Our approach simulates multiple independently-moving birds per species along different moving 3D trajectories, supporting controllable chirp sequences, overlapping choruses, and realistic 3D motion in scalable soundscapes while preserving species-specific acoustic patterns. A visualization interface provides bird trajectories, spectrograms, activity timelines, and sound waves for analytical and creative purposes. Both visual and audio evaluations demonstrate the ability of the system to generate dense, immersive, and ecologically inspired soundscapes, highlighting its potential for computer music, interactive virtual environments, and computational bioacoustics research."

Our method leverages the most significant literals extracted from the TM and performs conditional independence (CI) tests on these selected literals instead of the full set of variables, resulting in a considerable reduction in computational time. We implemented our approach and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Our evaluation includes categorical datasets from the bnlearn repository, such as Munin1, Hepar2. The findings indicate that the proposed TM-based method not only reduces computational complexity but also maintains competitive accuracy in causal discovery, making it a viable alternative to traditional PC algorithm implementations by offering improved efficiency without compromising performance."

    "abstract": "Humans can perceive and understand 3D space and long videos from sequential visual observations. But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of retrieval-augmented vision-language models, multimodal medical retrieval-augmented generation (MMed-RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in clinical decision support. These systems enhance medical applications by performing cross-modal retrieval to integrate relevant visual and textual evidence for tasks, e.g., report generation and disease diagnosis. However, their complex architecture also introduces underexplored adversarial vulnerabilities, particularly via visual input perturbations. In this paper, we propose Medusa, a novel framework for crafting cross-modal transferable adversarial attacks on MMed-RAG systems under a black-box setting. Specifically, Medusa formulates the attack as a perturbation optimization problem, leveraging a multi-positive InfoNCE loss (MPIL) to align adversarial visual embeddings with medically plausible but malicious textual targets, thereby hijacking the retrieval process. To enhance transferability, we adopt a surrogate model ensemble and design a dual-loop optimization strategy augmented with invariant risk minimization (IRM). Extensive experiments on two real-world medical tasks, including medical report generation and disease diagnosis, demonstrate that Medusa achieves over 90% average attack success rate across various generation models and retrievers under appropriate parameter configuration, while remaining robust against four mainstream defenses, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our results reveal critical vulnerabilities in the MMed-RAG systems and highlight the necessity of robustness benchmarking in safety-critical medical applications.

Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications.

We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game. We further model intra-round dynamics using an index to capture coordinated asynchronous seller updates coupled through buyers' joint constraints. Together, these constructions explain how local interactions propagate across auctions and gives premise for coherent equilibria--without requiring global information or centralized control."

In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$.

This metric serves as a robust measure which is related to the inclination of a galaxy. We find an empirical relationship between $η$ and inclination which is agnostic to the galaxy morphology. The PA is derived directly from the phase of the quadrupolar Fourier-Laguerre functions. Across a benchmark sample of galaxies, the method reproduces published inclination and PA values to within a median of 10$^\\circ$ and 5$^\\circ$, respectively, while also demonstrating essentially zero catastrophic failures. Applying this pipeline to galaxies from the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA), we report measurements of $η$, scale length and PA for three different bands of 133,942 disc galaxies.

Building on model predictive path integral (MPPI), we propose a dual-space spline parameterization that operates on position and velocity control points. Our approach enables contact-making and contact-breaking strategies that adapt automatically to task requirements, requiring only a limited number of sampled trajectories. This sample efficiency allows us to achieve real-time control on standard CPU hardware, eliminating the need for GPU acceleration typically required by other state-of-the-art MPPI methods. We validate our approach on the Go2 quadrupedal robot, demonstrating various emergent gaits and basic jumping capabilities.

Observations of GW190814 and GW230529 highlight the challenges gravitational waves face in distinguishing neutron stars from black holes. Interpreting these systems is especially difficult because classifications depend simultaneously on measurement noise, compact binary population models, and equation of state (EOS) constraints on the maximum neutron star mass. We analyze 66 confident events from GWTC-3 to quantify how the probability of a component being a neutron star, P(NS), varies across the population. The effects are substantial, the dominant drivers of classification are the pairing preferences of neutron stars with other compact objects, and the neutron star spin distributions. The data reveals that P(NS) varies between 1% - 67% for GW230529's primary and between 51% - 100% for GW190425's primary. By contrast, P(NS) for GW190814's secondary varies by <10%, demonstrating robustness from its high signal-to-noise ratio and small mass ratio. Analysis using EOS information tends to affect P(NS) through the inferred maximum neutron star mass rather than the maximum spin. As it stands, P(NS) remains sensitive to numerous population parameters, limiting its reliability and potentially leading to ambiguous classifications of future GW events."

Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity.

Existing compression techniques like token eviction, quantization, or other low-rank methods often risk information loss, have fixed limits, or introduce significant computational overhead from explicit decompression steps. In this work, we introduce SWAN, a novel, fine-tuning-free framework that eliminates this overhead. Our method uses an offline orthogonal matrix to rotate and prune the KV-cache, which is then used directly in the attention computation without any reconstruction. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAN, augmented with a small dense buffer, offers a robust trade-off, maintaining performance close to the uncompressed baseline even at aggressive 50-60% memory savings per-token on KV-cache. A key advantage is its runtime-tunable compression level, allowing operators to dynamically adjust the memory footprint, a flexibility absent in methods requiring fixed offline configurations. This combination of a decompression-free design, high performance under compression, and adaptability makes SWAN a practical and efficient solution for serving LLMs with long contexts."

By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\\% yielding over 90\\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

    "abstract": "Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance."

We investigate the interactions, and the collective impact, of the whole processing chain on the final secure key rate. This includes the quantum mechanical preprocessing in the form of entanglement distillation, processing of the entangled states via measurements and the necessary classical postprocessing based on the measurement results. Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys."

However, atmospheric turbulence, pointing errors, path loss, and atmospheric loss induce random attenuation, challenging link reliability. Adaptive rate control technology enhances spectrum utilization and reliability. We propose an adaptive probabilistic constellation shaping (A-PCS) coherent system utilizing enumerated spherical shaping (ESS) for distribution matching. With PCS-64QAM, the system achieves continuous rate control from conventional QPSK-equivalent to 64QAM spectral efficiency, providing quasi-continuous control with granularities of approximately $0.05$~bits/4D for spectral efficiency and $0.1$~dB for the post-FEC SNR threshold, and a maximum control depth of $12.5$~dB. Leveraging ESS for efficient sequence utilization, it offers higher spectral utilization and finer control granularity than constant composition DM (CCDM)-based A-PCS systems. We further model and analyze the FSO channel, presenting calculations and comparisons of outage probability and ergodic capacity under varying turbulence intensities and pointing errors. Results demonstrate 99.999~\\% reliability at maximum $σ_\\mathrm{R}^2 = 1.39$ and $σ_\\mathrm{s} = 0.5~\\mathrm{m}$, meeting requirements under severe turbulence and large pointing errors."

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of AI applications has created unprecedented demand for GPU resources. Cloud providers meet this demand through GPU-as-a-Service platforms that offer rentable GPU resources for running AI workloads. In this context, the sharing of GPU resources between different tenants is essential to maximize the number of scheduled workloads. Among the various GPU sharing technologies, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) stands out by partitioning GPUs at hardware level into isolated slices with dedicated compute and memory, ensuring strong tenant isolation, preventing resource contention, and enhancing security. Despite these advantages, MIG's fixed partitioning introduces scheduling rigidity, leading to severe GPU fragmentation in multi-tenant environments, where workloads are continuously deployed and terminated. Fragmentation leaves GPUs underutilized, limiting the number of workloads that can be accommodated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel scheduling framework for MIG-based clouds that maximizes workload acceptance while mitigating fragmentation in an online, workload-agnostic setting. We introduce a fragmentation metric to quantify resource inefficiency and guide allocation decisions. Building on this metric, our greedy scheduling algorithm selects GPUs and MIG slices that minimize fragmentation growth for each incoming workload. We evaluate our approach against multiple baseline strategies under diverse workload distributions. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves higher workload acceptance rates, leading to an average 10% increase in the number of scheduled workloads in heavy load conditions, while using approximately the same number of GPUs as the benchmark methods."

In this work, we extend existing theories of cascaded MZI systems to develop a generalized model tailored for wavelength-multiplexed parallel optical computing. Our comprehensive model incorporates component dispersion characteristics into a wavelength-dependent transfer matrix framework and is experimentally validated. We propose a computationally efficient compensation strategy that reduces global dispersion error within a 40 nm range from 0.22 to 0.039 using edge-spectrum calibration. This work establishes a fundamental framework for dispersion-aware model and error correction in MZI-based parallel optical computing chips, advancing the reliability of multi-wavelength photonic processors."

    "abstract": "Efficient deployment of small language models (SLMs) is essential for numerous real-world applications with stringent latency constraints. While previous work on SLM design has primarily focused on reducing the number of parameters to achieve parameter-optimal SLMs, parameter efficiency does not necessarily translate into proportional real-device speed-ups. This work aims to identify the key determinants of SLMs' real-device latency and offer generalizable principles and methodologies for SLM design and training when real-device latency is the primary consideration. Specifically, we identify two central architectural factors: depth-width ratios and operator choices. The former is crucial for small-batch-size latency, while the latter affects both latency and large-batch-size throughput. In light of this, we first study latency-optimal depth-width ratios, with the key finding that although deep-thin models generally achieve better accuracy under the same parameter budget, they may not lie on the accuracy-latency trade-off frontier. Next, we explore emerging efficient attention alternatives to evaluate their potential as candidate building operators. Using the identified promising operators, we construct an evolutionary search framework to automatically discover latency-optimal combinations of these operators within hybrid SLMs, thereby advancing the accuracy-latency frontier. In addition to architectural improvements, we further enhance SLM training using a weight normalization technique that enables more effective weight updates and improves final convergence. Combining these methods, we introduce a new family of hybrid SLMs, called Nemotron-Flash, which significantly advances the accuracy-efficiency frontier of state-of-the-art SLMs, e.g., achieving over +5.5% average accuracy, 1.3x/1.9x lower latency, and 18.7x/45.6x higher throughput compared to Qwen3-1.7B/0.6B, respectively."

Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{CoreEval}, a \\textbf{Co}ntamination-\\textbf{re}silient \\textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used."

While sign-based methods, such as sign stochastic gradient descent with majority voting (SIGNSGD-MV), offer substantial bandwidth savings, they remain vulnerable to inference attacks due to exposure of gradient signs. Existing secure aggregation techniques are either incompatible with sign-based methods or incur prohibitive overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Hi-SAFE, a lightweight and cryptographically secure aggregation framework for sign-based FL. Our core contribution is the construction of efficient majority vote polynomials for SIGNSGD-MV, derived from Fermat's Little Theorem. This formulation represents the majority vote as a low-degree polynomial over a finite field, enabling secure evaluation that hides intermediate values and reveals only the final result. We further introduce a hierarchical subgrouping strategy that ensures constant multiplicative depth and bounded per-user complexity, independent of the number of users n."

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts."

    "abstract": "Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods."

    "abstract": "Due to the inherent complexity, temporal patterns in real-world time series often evolve across multiple intertwined scales, including long-term periodicity, short-term fluctuations, and abrupt regime shifts. While existing literature has designed many sophisticated decomposition approaches based on the time or frequency domain to partition trend-seasonality components and high-low frequency components, an alternative line of approaches based on the wavelet domain has been proposed to provide a unified multi-resolution representation with precise time-frequency localization. However, most wavelet-based methods suffer from a persistent bias toward recursively decomposing only low-frequency components, severely underutilizing subtle yet informative high-frequency components that are pivotal for precise time series forecasting. To address this problem, we propose WaveTuner, a Wavelet decomposition framework empowered by full-spectrum subband Tuning for time series forecasting. Concretely, WaveTuner comprises two key modules: (i) Adaptive Wavelet Refinement module, that transforms time series into time-frequency coefficients, utilizes an adaptive router to dynamically assign subband weights, and generates subband-specific embeddings to support refinement; and (ii) Multi-Branch Specialization module, that employs multiple functional branches, each instantiated as a flexible Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with a distinct functional order to model a specific spectral subband. Equipped with these modules, WaveTuner comprehensively tunes global trends and local variations within a unified time-frequency framework. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate WaveTuner achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance in time series forecasting."

We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts.

In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp. Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science."

The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm to simulate rapidly distorted turbulence via linear combination of Hamiltonian (LCHS). The algorithm comprises three primary stages: the efficient preparation of an initial turbulent state with a prescribed energy spectrum, its subsequent time evolution via LCHS, and the direct measurement of key turbulence statistics. Our analysis indicates that the algorithm can offer a practical quantum speedup over the classical simulation methods for a sufficiently large computational grid. We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for simulating a minimal instance of non-trivial turbulence with classical validation. The numerical results show excellent agreement with ground-truth solutions, capturing both the qualitative evolution of turbulent fields and the quantitative behavior of statistics, including the Reynolds stresses and the fluctuating velocity spectrum. Despite its linearity, rapidly distorted turbulence captures essential turbulence mechanisms and may inform the development of quantum algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations. Our work establishes a foundation for addressing more complex turbulent phenomena on future fault-tolerant quantum computers."

    "abstract": "Many quantities characterizing infectious disease outbreaks - like the effective reproduction number ($R_t$), defined as the average number of secondary infections a newly infected individual will cause over the course of their infection - need to be modeled as time-varying parameters. It is common practice to use Gaussian random walks as priors for estimating such functions in Bayesian analyses of pathogen surveillance data. In this setting, however, the random walk prior may be too permissive, as it fails to capture prior scientific knowledge about the estimand and results in high posterior variance. We propose several Gaussian Markov process priors for $R_t$ inference, including the Integrated Brownian Motion (IBM), which can be represented as a Markov process when augmented with its corresponding Brownian Motion component, and is therefore computationally efficient and simple to implement and tune. We use simulated outbreak data to compare the performance of these proposed priors with the Gaussian random walk prior and another state-of-the-art Gaussian process prior based on an approximation to a Matérn covariance function. We find that IBM can match or exceed the performance of other priors, and we show that it produces epidemiologically reasonable and precise results when applied to county-level SARS-CoV-2 data."

Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters. These combined features give X HTBAR devices excellent integration compatibility and strong immunity to electrode related perturbations, making them promising multimode phonon sources for large scale quantum interconnects and microwave photonic integrated circuits."

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth of time-domain surveys, the volume of light curves has increased rapidly. However, many survey projects, such as Gaia, still rely on offline batch-processing workflows in which data are calibrated, merged, and released only after an observing phase is completed. This latency delays scientific analysis and causes many high-value transient events to be buried in archival data, missing the window for timely follow-up. While existing alert brokers handle heterogeneous data streams, it remains difficult to deploy a unified framework that combines high-performance incremental storage with real-time classification on local infrastructure. To address this challenge, we propose TDLight, a scalable system that adapts the time-series database TDengine (a high-performance IoT database) for astronomical data using a one-table-per-source schema. This architecture supports high-throughput ingestion, achieving 954,000 rows s^-1 for archived data and 541,000 rows s^-1 for incremental streams, while Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) indexing enables efficient cone-search queries. Building on this storage layer, we integrate the pre-trained hierarchical Random Forest classifier from the LEAVES framework to construct an incremental classification pipeline. Using the LEAVES dataset, we simulate data accumulation and evaluate a trigger-based strategy that performs early classification at specific observational milestones. In addition, by monitoring the evolution of classification probabilities, the system identifies \"high-value candidates\" -- sources that show high early confidence but later undergo significant label shifts. TDLight is released as an open-source Dockerized environment, providing a deployable infrastructure for next-generation time-domain surveys."

We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions.

Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance."

While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes advanced soft-magnetization techniques to enable ultra-fast and reliable black-start of grid-forming (GFM) converters. Conventional hard-magnetization with well-established three-phase voltages during transformer energization induces severe inrush currents due to flux offset, which can damage power semiconductor devices. To overcome this drawback, an ultra-fast soft-magnetization method is firstly introduced, leveraging the voltage programmability of the inverter to actively reshape the initial voltage profile and thereby eliminate flux offset of the transformer core. By suppressing the formation of flux offset itself, the proposed approach prevents magnetic saturation and achieves nominal terminal voltage within a few milliseconds while effectively suppressing inrush current. However, this method can still trigger surge currents to power semiconductor devices in the presence of an LC filter due to abrupt voltage magnitude and phase transitions. To address this issue, an enhanced Archimedean spiral soft-magnetization method is developed, where both voltage magnitude and phase evolve smoothly to simultaneously suppress inrush and surge currents. Furthermore, residual flux in the transformer core is considered, and a demagnetization sequence using the inverter is validated to ensure reliable start-up. Experimental results confirm that the proposed methods achieve rapid black-start performance within one fundamental cycle while ensuring safe and stable operation of GFM converters."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures."

    "abstract": "Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design."

    "abstract": "Origami as a deployable structure offers the unique advantage of achieving compact stowage via flat-folding while forming a well-defined surface composed of rigid panels upon deployment. However, since origami consists of flat facets, it is inherently limited in forming smooth curved surfaces upon deployment. This limitation restricts its applicability in systems where smooth curved geometries are essential for performance, such as aerospace systems and electromagnetic communication devices. Herein, we propose an inverse design methodology for thick origami that is capable of flat-folding while forming a smooth curved outer surface upon deployment. By establishing flat-foldable constraints that specify the positions of the creases, our method constructs thick origami capable of flat-folding even with panels that include a curved facet. Furthermore, by representing the origami layout as a graph, we enumerate all possible origami configurations and enable flexible design of the internal structure. Analytical results show that the optimized packaging ratio increases as the number of cells in a layout increases, indicating that the proposed design methodology provides controllability over the packaging ratio through the number of cells. Using our proposed design methodology, we fabricated a deployable origami wing and demonstrated its functionality through successful flight testing, in which the wing was subjected to aerodynamic loads. Our work proposes a new strategy for packaging smooth curved surfaces, addressing the packaging challenges encountered in aerospace and electromagnetic communications and thereby providing greater design freedom."

When the strain is varied adiabatically along a closed path enclosing the Dirac cone, the order parameter acquires a Berry phase of $π$, which originates from a half rotation of the superconducting gap function. This half rotation leaves a topological signature in the superfluid stiffness tensor, making it directly observable through the geometry of vortices and the upper critical field."

The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation."

A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model."

Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini."

To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed \"consistent\" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets."

To tackle this issue, we collect real-world user video-watching sequences, annotate the reasons for users' dislikes, and construct a benchmark dataset for personalized explanations. We then introduce the Agentic Explainable Negative Feedback (ENF) framework, which integrates three core components: (1) the Profile Agent, extracting behavioral cues from users' historical data to derive psychological and personality profiles; (2) the Video Agent, performing comprehensive multimodal video analysis; and (3) the Reason Agent, synthesizing information from the other two agents to predict user engagement and generate explanations.

Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in negative feedback prediction and reason explanation. Notably, it achieves an 8.6% improvement over GPT-4o in reason classification. Deployment on the business platform further validates its benefits: increasing average user watch time by 6.2%, reducing the fast-skip rate by 9.4%, and significantly enhancing user satisfaction."

We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy."

    "abstract": "Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a new class of neural architectures that replace conventional linear transformations and node-based nonlinearities with spline-based function approximations distributed along network edges. Although KANs offer strong expressivity and interpretability, their heterogeneous spline and base branch parameters hinder efficient quantization, which remains unexamined compared to CNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we present QuantKAN, a unified framework for quantizing KANs across both quantization aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) regimes. QuantKAN extends modern quantization algorithms, such as LSQ, LSQ+, PACT, DoReFa, QIL, GPTQ, BRECQ, AdaRound, AWQ, and HAWQ-V2, to spline based layers with branch-specific quantizers for base, spline, and activation components. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR 10, and CIFAR 100 across multiple KAN variants (EfficientKAN, FastKAN, PyKAN, and KAGN), we establish the first systematic benchmarks for low-bit spline networks. Our results show that KANs, particularly deeper KAGN variants, are compatible with low-bit quantization but exhibit strong method architecture interactions: LSQ, LSQ+, and PACT preserve near full precision accuracy at 4 bit for shallow KAN MLP and ConvNet models, while DoReFa provides the most stable behavior for deeper KAGN under aggressive low-bit settings. For PTQ, GPTQ and Uniform consistently deliver the strongest overall performance across datasets, with BRECQ highly competitive on simpler regimes such as MNIST. Our proposed QuantKAN framework thus unifies spline learning and quantization, and provides practical tools and guidelines for efficiently deploying KANs in real-world, resource-constrained environments."

This trend has driven the integration of dedicated hardware encoders into modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Nowadays, these encoders support advanced codecs like HEVC and AV1 and feature specialized Low-Latency and Ultra Low-Latency tuning, targeting end-to-end latencies of < 2 seconds and < 500 ms, respectively. As the demand for such capabilities grows toward the 6G era, a clear understanding of their performance implications is essential. In this work, we evaluate the low-latency encoding modes on GPUs from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD from both Rate-Distortion (RD) performance and latency perspectives. The results are then compared against both the normal-latency tuning of hardware encoders and leading software encoders. Results show hardware encoders achieve significantly lower E2E latency than software solutions with slightly better RD performance. While standard Low-Latency tuning yields a poor quality-latency trade-off, the Ultra Low-Latency mode reduces E2E latency to 83 ms (5 frames) without additional RD impact. Furthermore, hardware encoder latency is largely insensitive to quality presets, enabling high-quality, low-latency streams without compromise."

We also show that our ReLU-based maximum score (RMS) estimator can be generalized to an umbrella framework defined by multi-index single-crossing (MISC) conditions, while the original maximum score estimator cannot be applied. We establish the $n^{-s/(2s+1)}$ convergence rate and asymptotic normality for the RMS estimator under order-$s$ Holder smoothness. In addition, we propose an alternative estimator using a further reformulation of RMS as a special layer in a deep neural network (DNN) architecture, which allows the estimation procedure to be implemented via state-of-the-art software and hardware for DNN."

    "abstract": "In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime."

We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states.

Understanding and quantifying homophily (similarity-driven association) in such networks is essential for analyzing community formation and information flow. We propose a hyperedge-centric framework to quantify homophily in hypergraphs. Each interaction is represented as a hyperedge, and its interaction perplexity measures the effective number of distinct attributes it contains. Comparing this observed perplexity with a degree-preserving random baseline defines the diversity gap, which quantifies how diverse an interaction is than expected by chance. The global homophily score for a network, called Perplexity-Homophily Index, is computed by averaging the normalized diversity gap across all hyperedges. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed index captures the full distribution of homophily and reveals how homophilic and heterophilic tendencies vary with interaction size in hypergraphs."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as \"What treats asthma?\" or \"What is the capital of Latvia?\". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\\leq 8.2\\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone."

Incorporating these into the critic objective using a Sobolev-type loss encourages the critic to align with both the value and local geometry of the target function. This first-order TD matching principle can be seamlessly integrated into existing algorithms, such as Q-learning or actor-critic methods (e.g., DDPG, SAC), potentially leading to faster critic convergence and more stable policy gradients without altering their overall structure."

While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence."

Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K).

We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument.

This view originates in work by de Queiroz and collaborators and yields a weak groupoid structure for equality, together with a computational account of homotopy inspired by homotopy type theory. In this paper we present a complete mechanization of this framework in Lean 4 and show how it supports concrete homotopy theoretic computations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we formalize the theory of computational paths in Lean, including path formation, composition, inverses, and a rewrite system that identifies redundant or trivial paths. We prove that equality types with computational paths carry a weak groupoid structure in the sense of the original theory. Second, we organize this material into a reusable Lean library, ComputationalPathsLean, which exposes an interface for paths, rewrites, and loop spaces. This library allows later developments to treat computational paths as a drop-in replacement for propositional equality when reasoning about homotopical structure. Third, we apply the library to two canonical examples in algebraic topology. We give Lean proofs that the fundamental group of the circle is isomorphic to the integers and that the fundamental group of the torus is isomorphic to the product of two copies of the integers, both via computational paths. These case studies demonstrate that the computational paths approach scales to nontrivial homotopical computations in a modern proof assistant. All the definitions and proofs described here are available in an open-source Lean 4 repository."

Using the traditional single-streamer breakdown criterion, the simulated positive breakdown voltage agrees well with experimental measurements, whereas the simulated negative breakdown voltage deviates markedly from the experiments, so the single-streamer breakdown criterion fails to reproduce the abnormal polarity effect observed experimentally. In addressing this, we propose an ion-ion plasma breakdown criterion for negative breakdown voltage. When this novel criterion is applied, the simulated negative breakdown voltage agrees with the experiments and reflects the abnormal polarity effect. Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of key physical parameters reveals that, the dynamic mechanism for ion-ion plasma breakdown for negative polarity can be divided into four stages: primary streamer stage, ion accumulation stage, reconstructive ionization stage, and ion-ion plasma propagation stage. Notably, the ion-ion plasma propagation stage is dominated by photoionization-driven negative-ion accumulation rather than conventional impact ionization."

    "abstract": "Multi-rotor UAVs face limited flight time due to battery constraints. Autonomous docking on blimps with onboard battery recharging and data offloading offers a promising solution for extended UAV missions. However, the vulnerability of blimps to wind gusts causes trajectory deviations, requiring precise, obstacle-aware docking strategies. To this end, this work introduces two key novelties: (i) a temporal convolutional network that predicts blimp responses to wind gusts, enabling rapid gust detection and estimation of points where the wind gust effect has subsided; (ii) a model predictive controller (MPC) that leverages these predictions to compute collision-free trajectories for docking, enabled by a novel obstacle avoidance method for close-range manoeuvres near the blimp. Simulation results show our method outperforms a baseline constant-velocity model of the blimp significantly across different scenarios. We further validate the approach in real-world experiments, demonstrating the first autonomous multi-rotor docking control strategy on blimps shown outside simulation.

DiPASS introduces the first channel model that accurately captures the directional, pencil-like radiation of pinching antennas, incorporates a practical waveguide attenuation of 1.3 dB/m, and accounts for stochastic line-of-sight blockage. A key enabler of DiPASS is our new \"equal quota division\" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks."

However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs."

Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network."

    "abstract": "Understanding how the causal effect of a treatment evolves over time, including the potential for waning, is important for informed decisions on treatment discontinuation or repetition. For example, waning vaccine protection influences booster dose recommendations, while cost-effectiveness analyses require accounting for long-term efficacy of treatments. However, there is no consensus on the methodology to assess and account for treatment effect waning. Even in randomized controlled trials, the common naïve comparison of hazard functions can lead to misleading causal conclusions due to inherent selection bias. Although comparing survival curves is sometimes recommended as a safer measure of causal effect, it only represents a cumulative effect over time and does not address treatment effect waning. We also explore recent formulations of causal hazard ratios, based on the principal stratification approach or the controlled direct effect. These causal hazard ratios cannot be identified without strong modeling assumptions, but bounds can be derived accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and one could try to use them to detect treatment effect waning. However, we illustrate that an increase in causal hazard ratios towards one does not necessarily mean that the protective effect of the treatment is fading. Furthermore, the same survival functions may correspond to both scenarios with and without waning, which shows that treatment effect waning cannot be identified from standard time-to-event data without strong untestable modeling assumptions."

Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications."

A $^{7}$LiYF$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$ crystal is chosen as an example. First, we show that temperatures in the range 10-35 K can be measured using the Boltzmann behavior of the populations of crystal-field levels separated by an energy interval of 23 cm$^{-1}$. Then we select the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ line of the holmium $^5I_5 \\rightarrow ^5I_7$ transition, which has a well-resolved hyperfine structure and falls within the transparency window of optical fibers (telecommunication S band), to demonstrate the possibility of measuring temperatures below 3 K. The temperature $T$ is determined by a least-squares fit to the measured intensities of all eight hyperfine components using the dependence $I(ν) = I_1 \\exp(-bν)$, where $I_1$ and $b = aν+ \\fracν{kT}$ are fitting parameters and a accounts for intensity variations due to mixing of wave functions of different crystal-field levels by the hyperfine interaction. In this method, the absolute and relative thermal sensitivities grow at $T$ approaching zero as $\\frac{1}{T^2}$.and $\\frac{1}{T}$, respectively. We theoretically considered the intensity distributions within hyperfine manifolds and compared the results with experimental data. Application of the method to experimentally measured relative intensities of hyperfine components of the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ PL line yielded $T = 3.7 \\pm 0.2$ K. For a temperature of 1 K, an order of magnitude better accuracy is expected."

However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

The results show the emergence of steady reactive state for certain values of $r_{NO}$ and of exchange diffusion rate $x$ when the simulations take place on square lattices. Our findings on the hexagonal lattice also show that the diffusion of these species favors the appearance of the active phase for values of $r_{NO}$ lower than that found for the standard model. In addition, we observed that the system possesses a continuous phase transition and a discontinuous one separating the active phase from absorbing states for both lattices, except for $r_{NO}=1$ in which the continuous phase transition is destroyed and a steady reactive state emerges from the beginning since very small values of $x$."

To address this challenge, we introduce cost-regularized unbalanced optimal transport (CR-UOT), a framework that allows the ground cost to vary while allowing mass creation and removal. We show that CR-UOT incorporates unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein type problems through families of inner-product costs parameterized by linear transformations, enabling the matching of measures or point clouds across Euclidean spaces. We develop algorithms for such CR-UOT problems using entropic regularization and demonstrate that this approach improves the alignment of heterogeneous single-cell omics profiles, especially when many cells lack direct matches."

To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation."

This paper presents a full multigrid method to compute the solution in a compressed format that reduces the storage complexity of the solution and intermediate vectors to $\\mathcal O(n)$ bits. This reduction allows a matrix-free implementation to solve elliptic PDEs with an overall linear space complexity. For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids."

The proof combines pseudodifferential tools with dynamical systems results: we perform a resonant normal form procedure to reduce our analysis to the classical dynamics for the resonant equation. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics. This is obtained by means of a positive commutator estimate on the operator associated with the escape function, exploiting microlocal analysis."

Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel quadrature strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) boundary element discretizations, specifically tailored to collocation methods. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction and the natural handling of unbounded domains, boundary integral formulations are particularly appealing in the IgA framework. However, they require the evaluation of boundary integrals whose kernels exhibit singular or nearly singular behavior. Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates."

    "abstract": "Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and the impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is estimated. Predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the $T_{4c}$ state are presented assuming different rapidities, distinct quantum numbers of the state and center-of-mass energies. Our results indicate that the higher cross-section is associated with the production of a tensor state $T_{4c}(2^{++})$, which is dominated by the gluon-initiated process. In contrast, the production of the axial-vector state $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ is dominated by the charm-initiated process and is very sensitive to the presence (or not) of an intrinsic charm."

    "abstract": "In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment."

    "abstract": "Engineering programmes, particularly in Latin America, are often governed by rigid curricula and strict regularity rules that are claimed to create a Regularity Trap for capable students. This study tests that causal hypothesis using the CAPIRE framework, a leakage-aware pipeline that integrates curriculum topology and causal estimation. Using longitudinal data from 1,343 civil engineering students in Argentina, we formalize academic lag (accumulated friction) as a treatment and academic velocity as an ability proxy. A manual LinearDML estimator is employed to assess the average (ATE) and conditional (CATE) causal effects of lag on subsequent dropout, controlling for macro shocks (strikes, inflation). Results confirm that academic lag significantly increases dropout risk overall (ATE = 0.0167, p < 0.0001). However, the effect decreases sharply for high-velocity (high-ability) students, contradicting the universal Trap hypothesis. Archetype analysis (UMAP/DBSCAN) shows that friction disproportionately harms trajectories already characterized by high initial friction and unstable progression. 8 We conclude that regularity rules function as a Structural Amplifier of pre-existing vulnerability rather than a universal trap. This has direct implications for engineering curriculum design, demanding targeted slack allocation and intervention policies to reduce friction at core basic-cycle courses"

    "abstract": "With their jet pointing towards us, blazars are ideal tools to study the physics and structure of extragalactic jets. Their powerful jets are cosmic particle accelerators and are alleged to be one of the production sites of the high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Observatory. Doppler beaming of the jet nonthermal radiation increases blazar brightness, blue-shifts their emission, and shortens their variability time scales, which are observed to range from years down to minutes. This review will focus on blazar flux, spectral, and polarization variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Interpretation of blazar variability calls into question both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Shock waves, magnetic reconnection, and turbulence can accelerate particles inside the jet, while jet precession, rotation, and twisting can produce variations in Doppler beaming. Microvariability puts strong constraints on the size of the emitting regions, suggesting a multizone emitting jet. Twisting jets have been proposed to explain the long-term multiwavelength variability. They are supported by radio observations of bent or helical jets, and by results of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of plasma jets. Detection of (quasi)periodic behaviour has been ascribed to orbital motion in black hole binary systems, jet precession, kink instabilities developing inside the jet, or perturbations in the accretion disc. Gravitational microlensing has been suggested to explain blazar behaviour in some cases. Polarization provides information on the structure and behaviour of the magnetic field in the emission zones. Both the degree and angle of polarization can show strong and fast variability, which is sometimes correlated with flux. The interpretation of flux, spectral, and polarization variability within a consistent picture challenges current models of blazar variability."

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."

Curvature scattering is a leading candidate mechanism to limit such deviations, but its role remains insufficiently understood. We investigate the limits of ion temperature anisotropy in a magnetotail-like configuration by modeling a quasi-1D current sheet with a finite magnetic field curvature and three ion populations. We derive analytical thresholds for anisotropy based on current sheet stability and validate against spacecraft observations and numerical results. Our findings demonstrate that curvature scattering imposes limits on ion anisotropies, thereby maintaining the stability of the current sheet."

Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $α-Ω$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models."

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\\textbf{horizon}$.

To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

Recent approaches such as Meaning Typed Programming (MTP) automate prompt generation by leveraging the semantics already present in code. However, many real-world applications depend on contextual cues, developer intent, and domain-specific reasoning that extend beyond what static code semantics alone can express. To address this limitation, we introduce Semantic Engineering, a lightweight method for enriching program semantics so that LLM-based systems can more accurately reflect developer intent without requiring full manual prompt design. We present Semantic Context Annotations (SemTexts), a language-level mechanism that allows developers to embed natural-language context directly into program constructs. Integrated into the Jac programming language, Semantic Engineering extends MTP to incorporate these enriched semantics during prompt generation. We further introduce a benchmark suite designed to reflect realistic AI-Integrated application scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Semantic Engineering substantially improves prompt fidelity, achieving performance comparable to Prompt Engineering while requiring significantly less developer effort."

However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available."

Where previous data driven, set-based approaches to PI set synthesis used deterministic sampling schemes, this work instead synthesizes PI sets from any pre-collected data sets. Beyond a data set and Lipschitz continuity, no additional information about the system is needed. A tree data structure is used to partition the space and select samples used to construct the PI set, while Lipschitz continuity is used to provide deterministic guarantees of invariance. Finally, probabilistic bounds are given on the number of samples needed for the algorithm to determine of a certain volume."

These multi-agent interactions pose a fundamental challenge, particularly in social dilemmas, where agents' individual incentives can undermine collective welfare. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for aligning large language models (LLMs) in the single-agent regime, prior small-network results suggest that standard RL in multi-agent settings often converges to defecting, self-interested policies. We show the same effect in LLMs: despite cooperative priors, RL-trained LLM agents develop opportunistic behavior that can exploit even advanced closed-source models. To address this tendency of RL to converge to poor equilibria, we adapt a recent opponent-learning awareness algorithm, Advantage Alignment, to fine-tune LLMs toward multi-agent cooperation and non-exploitability. We then introduce a group-relative baseline that simplifies advantage computation in iterated games, enabling multi-agent training at LLM scale. We also contribute a novel social dilemma environment, Trust and Split, which requires natural language communication to achieve high collective welfare. Across a wide range of social dilemmas, policies learned with Advantage Alignment achieve higher collective payoffs while remaining robust against exploitation by greedy agents."

Unlike linear arrays, which restrict steering to a single axis, 2D arrays offer dual-axis optimization, although elevation control remains challenging. This study explores the integration of autograd, an automatic differentiation tool, with concentric circular arrays to impose beamwidth and frequency invariance constraints. This enables continuous optimization over both angles while maintaining performance across a wide frequency range. We evaluate our method through simulations of beamwidth, white noise gain, and directivity across multiple frequencies. A comparative analysis is presented against standard and advanced beamformers, including delay-and-sum, modified delay-and-sum, a Jacobi-Anger expansion-based method, and a Gaussian window-based gradient descent approach. Our method achieves superior spatial selectivity and narrower mainlobes, particularly in the elevation axis at lower frequencies. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing beamforming performance for acoustic sensing and spatial audio applications requiring precise dual-axis control."

As a concrete scenario we consider the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model and find constraints on the size of the extra dimension and the curvature of $AdS_5$. We discuss the implications of these bounds for strongly warped throats and D-brane uplifts commonly used in attempts to realise metastable de Sitter vacua in string theory."

    "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability."

The thesis introduces a new Triple Scissors Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM) for space antenna missions. The new mechanism is to be stowed during launch and efficiently deploy in orbit, offering maximum aperture size while taking up minimal launch volume. The thesis covers the entire design process from geometric modeling, kinematic analysis with screw theory and Newtonian approaches, dynamic analysis by eigenvalue and simulation methods, and verification with SolidWorks. In addition, optimization routines were coded based on Support Vector Machines for material choice in LEO environments and machine learning method for geometric setup. The TSDTM presented has enhanced structural dynamics with good comparison between simulation and analytical predictions. The structure optimized proved highly accurate, with a deviation of just 1.94% between machine learning-predicted and simulated natural frequencies, demonstrating the potential of incorporating AI-based methods in space structural design."

    "abstract": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning paradigm for post-training video generation models. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO."

For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies.

    "abstract": "Statistically-significant differences in the value of the Hubble parameter are found depending on the measurement method that is used, a result known as the Hubble tension. A variety of ways of comparing, grouping, and excluding measurements have been used to try to explain this, either in terms of physical effects or systematic errors. We present a systematic 'Bayesian jackknife' analysis of 16 independent measurements of the Hubble parameter in an attempt to identify whether the measurements fall into meaningful clusters that would help explain the origin of the tension. After evaluating evidence ratios for the commonly-used split into early- vs late-time measurements, we then study a range of simplified alternative physical scenarios that reflect different physical origins of an apparent bias or shift in the value of $H_0$, assigning phenomenological population parameters to each subset. These include scenarios where specific subsets are biased (e.g. due to unrecognised experimental systematics in the local distance ladder or cosmic microwave background measurements), as well as more cosmologically-motivated cases involving modifications to the expansion history. Many of these scenarios have similar marginal likelihood, but the model where no measurements are biased is strongly disfavoured. Finally, we marginalise over all these scenarios to estimate the 'model agnostic' posterior distribution of $H_0$. The resulting distribution is mildly multi-modal, but modestly favours values near $H_0=68$ km/s/Mpc, with a 95\\% credible region of $66.7 < H_0 < 72.7$ km/s/Mpc."

Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics."

We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled. The theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on a mechatronic system consisting of a pendulum actuated by a DC motor."

Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model refinement."

To facilitate TMPRT, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D-CRT planning techniques were developed following the guidelines of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial. Plans were evaluated with respect to homogeneity, conformality, and adherence to dose constraints. Deliverability of plans was assessed using in-phantom measurements for absorbed dose accuracy at low dose rates and using EPID for isodose verification. For VMAT only single arc plans were found to be acceptable due to otherwise unacceptably heterogeneous field doses, while for dynamic conformal arcs machine limtations on the number of monitor units per degree require the use of partial arcs for each pulse. Delivery of plans at low dose rates (< 100 MU/min) was accurate with high Gamma pass rates on modern LINACs and moderate pass rates on legacy LINACs, in line with their general performance. Generally, VMAT is preferred to achieve optimal homogeneity, conformality, and organ-at-risk sparing, while the use of 3D-CRT can increase the availability of TMPRT for more patients and clinics."

We consider a scenario where a multi-antenna, dual-function base station (BS) performs secure beamforming for a multi-antenna legitimate receiver while simultaneously detecting potential targets. Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs."

However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research."

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked. To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset."

In many ways, our methods parallel Li's work generalizing Regge calculus to higher order, as Regge elements can be thought of as symmetric tensor products of one-forms. However, whereas the constant coefficient Regge space has one shape function per edge, the constant coefficient space of double-forms in our paper has one shape function per triangle and two shape functions per tetrahedron, so we must address the fact that there are shape functions of two different types.

To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216 which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-03-14-1283 is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting."

In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic."

Yet, existing federated learning work largely overlooks the security risks that arise when local adaptation occurs at test time. Heterogeneous domain arrivals, diverse adaptation algorithms, and limited cross-client visibility create vulnerabilities where compromised participants can craft poisoned inputs and submit adversarial updates that undermine both global and per-client performance. To address this threat, we introduce FedPoisonTTP, a realistic grey-box attack framework that explores test-time data poisoning in the federated adaptation setting. FedPoisonTTP distills a surrogate model from adversarial queries, synthesizes in-distribution poisons using feature-consistency, and optimizes attack objectives to generate high-entropy or class-confident poisons that evade common adaptation filters. These poisons are injected during local adaptation and spread through collaborative updates, leading to broad degradation. Extensive experiments on corrupted vision benchmarks show that compromised participants can substantially diminish overall test-time performance."

The transport time is investigated in both one- and two-dimensional models with topological non-trivial band structures. The fast transport is inherited with the wavefunction localization, giving a stronger effective coupling strength between the mode and the measurement leads. Also the transport time in one-dimension is independent of the system size. To verify the asertion, we implement a chain of split-ring resonators and their complementary ones with controllable hopping strengths. By performing the measurements on the group delay of non-trivially topological edge states with pulse excitations, the transport time between two edge states is directly observed with the chain length up to $20$. Along the route to harness topology to protect optical information, our experimental demonstrations provide a crucial guideline for utilizing photonic topological devices."

To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence."

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of high-quality data, large language models (LLMs) are often trained on mixtures of data with varying quality levels, even after sophisticated data curation. A natural approach to better leverage high-quality data is curriculum-based pretraining, where the model is trained on data sorted in ascending order of quality as determined by a quality metric. However, prior studies have reported limited improvements from such curriculum-based pretraining strategies. This work identifies a critical factor constraining these methods: the incompatibility between the ascending data quality order and the decaying learning rate (LR) schedule. We find that while curriculum-based training substantially outperforms random shuffling when using a constant LR, its advantage diminishes under standard LR decay schedules. Our experiments show this incompatibility can be mitigated by two simple strategies: (1) employing a more moderate LR decay schedule, where the final LR is only moderately smaller than the peak LR, and (2) replacing LR decay with model averaging, i.e., computing a weighted average of the final few checkpoints. By combining these strategies, we improve the average score on a suite of standard benchmarks by 1.64% over random shuffling, without additional data refinement. Validated on 1.5B-parameter models trained over 30B tokens with various data-quality metrics, our findings call for a re-evaluation of curriculum-based LLM pretraining and underscore the potential of co-designing data curricula with optimization methods."

However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading approach for high-quality novel view synthesis, with numerous variants extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of 3D and 4D scene reconstruction tasks. Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features. Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers."

In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods."

Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms.

Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness."

We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions. We show that these off-equatorial orbits are a unique feature of the magnetic charge, being forbidden in the analogous electrically charged Kerr-Newman spacetime.

Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

    "abstract": "Content moderation pipelines for modern large language models combine static filters, dedicated moderation services, and alignment tuned base models, yet real world deployments still exhibit dangerous failure modes. This paper presents RoguePrompt, an automated jailbreak attack that converts a disallowed user query into a self reconstructing prompt which passes provider moderation while preserving the original harmful intent. RoguePrompt partitions the instruction across two lexical streams, applies nested classical ciphers, and wraps the result in natural language directives that cause the target model to decode and execute the hidden payload. Our attack assumes only black box access to the model and to the associated moderation endpoint. We instantiate RoguePrompt against GPT 4o and evaluate it on 2 448 prompts that a production moderation system previously marked as strongly rejected. Under an evaluation protocol that separates three security relevant outcomes bypass, reconstruction, and execution the attack attains 84.7 percent bypass, 80.2 percent reconstruction, and 71.5 percent full execution, substantially outperforming five automated jailbreak baselines. We further analyze the behavior of several automated and human aligned evaluators and show that dual layer lexical transformations remain effective even when detectors rely on semantic similarity or learned safety rubrics. Our results highlight systematic blind spots in current moderation practice and suggest that robust deployment will require joint reasoning about user intent, decoding workflows, and model side computation rather than surface level toxicity alone."

    "abstract": "We study the problem of excess risk evaluation for empirical risk minimization (ERM) under general convex loss functions. Our contribution is an efficient refitting procedure that computes the excess risk and provides high-probability upper bounds under the fixed-design setting. Assuming only black-box access to the training algorithm and a single dataset, we begin by generating two sets of artificially modified pseudo-outcomes termed wild response, created by stochastically perturbing the gradient vectors with carefully chosen scaling. Using these two pseudo-labeled datasets, we then refit the black-box procedure twice to obtain two corresponding wild predictors. Finally, leveraging the original predictor, the two wild predictors, and the constructed wild responses, we derive an efficient excess risk upper bound. A key feature of our analysis is that it requires no prior knowledge of the complexity of the underlying function class. As a result, the method is essentially model-free and holds significant promise for theoretically evaluating modern opaque machine learning system--such as deep nerral networks and generative model--where traditional capacity-based learning theory becomes infeasible due to the extreme complexity of the hypothesis class."

The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets.

The hull plays a crucial role in determining the complexity of algorithms used to check the permutation equivalence of two linear codes and compute a linear code's automorphism group. Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest. A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes\", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that any LCD code over an extended binary field \\( \\FF_q \\) (where \\( q > 3 \\)) with a minimum distance of at least $2$ is equivalent to the one-dimensional hull of a linear code under a specific weak condition. Furthermore, we provide a construction for creating hulls with \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensionality from an \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hull of a linear code, again under a weak condition. This corresponds to a particularly challenging direction, as creating \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hulls from \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensional hulls. Finally, we derive several constructions for the \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hulls of linear codes as a consequence of our results."

Although existing methods address this issue by adjusting logits based on the estimated class distribution of unlabeled data, they often handle model imbalance in a coarse-grained manner, conflating data imbalance with bias arising from varying class-specific learning difficulties. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework, SC-SSL, which suppresses model bias through decoupled sampling control. During training, we identify the key variables for sampling control under ideal conditions. By introducing a classifier with explicit expansion capability and adaptively adjusting sampling probabilities across different data distributions, SC-SSL mitigates feature-level imbalance for minority classes. In the inference phase, we further analyze the weight imbalance of the linear classifier and apply post-hoc sampling control with an optimization bias vector to directly calibrate the logits. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets and distribution settings validate the consistency and state-of-the-art performance of SC-SSL."

Sometime {CNOT, Rz} blocks are large, such as in QAOA ansatzes, HOPPS's pursuit of optimality limits its scalability. To address this issue, we introduce an iterative blockwise optimization strategy: large circuits are partitioned into smaller blocks, each block is optimally refined, and the process is repeated for several iterations. Empirical results show that HOPPS is more efficient comparing with existing near optimal synthesis tools. Used as a peephole optimizer, HOPPS reduces the CNOT count by up to 50.0% and the CNOT depth by up to 57.1% under OLSQ. For large QAOA circuit, after mapping by Qiskit, circuit can be reduced CNOT count and depth by up to 44.4% and 42.4% by our iterative blockwise optimization.

To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems."

Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis."

However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models.

The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods."

Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments."

Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed. In summary, our packing model and mixing metric enable one to accurately explore the enormous space of hypothetical layered mosaic alloy compositions and identify materials with potentially desirable optoelectronic and magnetic properties."

    "abstract": "Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment."

    "abstract": "Present day speed test tools measure peak throughput, but often fail to capture the user-perceived responsiveness of a network connection under load. Recently, platforms such as NDT, Ookla Speedtest and Cloudflare Speed Test have introduced metrics such as ``latency under load'' or ``working latency'' to fill this gap. Yet, the sensitivity of these metrics to basic network configurations such as Active Queue Management (AQM) remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the impact of AQM on speed test measurements in a laboratory setting. Using controlled experiments, we compare the distribution of throughput and latency under different load measurements across different AQM schemes, including CoDel, FQ-CoDel and Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ). On comparing with a standard drop-tail baseline, we find that measurements have high variance across AQM schemes and load conditions. These results highlight the critical role of AQM in shaping how emerging latency metrics should be interpreted, and underscore the need for careful calibration of speed test platforms before their results are used to guide policy or regulatory outcomes."

The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set.

Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided."

    "abstract": "On-device agents on smartphones increasingly require continuously evolving memory to support personalized, context-aware, and long-term behaviors. To meet both privacy and responsiveness demands, user data is embedded as vectors and stored in a vector database for fast similarity search. However, most existing vector databases target server-class environments. When ported directly to smartphones, two gaps emerge: (G1) a mismatch between mobile SoC constraints and vector-database assumptions, including tight bandwidth budgets, limited on-chip memory, and stricter data type and layout constraints; and (G2) a workload mismatch, because on-device usage resembles a continuously learning memory, in which queries must coexist with frequent inserts, deletions, and ongoing index maintenance. To address these challenges, we propose AME, an on-device Agentic Memory Engine co-designed with modern smartphone SoCs. AME introduces two key techniques: (1) a hardware-aware, high-efficiency matrix pipeline that maximizes compute-unit utilization and exploits multi-level on-chip storage to sustain high throughput; and (2) a hardware- and workload-aware scheduling scheme that coordinates querying, insertion, and index rebuilding to minimize latency. We implement AME on Snapdragon 8-series SoCs and evaluate it on HotpotQA. In our experiments, AME improves query throughput by up to 1.4x at matched recall, achieves up to 7x faster index construction, and delivers up to 6x higher insertion throughput under concurrent query workloads."

We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible.

A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure."

A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms."

We study this phenomenon in a canonical nonlinear model: phase retrieval with anisotropic Gaussian inputs whose covariance spectrum follows a power law. Unlike the isotropic case, where dynamics collapse to a two-dimensional system, anisotropy yields a qualitatively new regime in which an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations governs the evolution of the summary statistics. We develop a tractable reduction that reveals a three-phase trajectory: (i) fast escape from low alignment, (ii) slow convergence of the summary statistics, and (iii) spectral-tail learning in low-variance directions. From this decomposition, we derive explicit scaling laws for the mean-squared error, showing how spectral decay dictates convergence times and error curves. Experiments confirm the predicted phases and exponents. These results provide the first rigorous characterization of scaling laws in nonlinear regression with anisotropic data, highlighting how anisotropy reshapes learning dynamics."

We propose augmenting tangible textures of varying hardness by applying vibrations to dynamically modulate their perceived roughness, thus leveraging both the material’s mechanical properties and the perceptual potential of vibration. Our results, obtained via hierarchical clustering of frequency–amplitude combinations of transverse sinusoidal vibrations, show that for each tested physical texture, modulation of perceived roughness can produce at least three distinct virtual textures. This approach allows the generation of a diverse range of tactile sensations from a limited set of physical textures, simplifying their integration into virtual environments through the concurrent variation of two essential tactile properties."

    "abstract": "Deepfake techniques can now generate multimodal content comprising video and audio tracks. Compared with unimodal Deepfake images, videos or audio, multimodal Deepfake content is more deceptive and easily leads to the dissemination of hate speech, incitement to violence, and disinformation. Therefore, the detection of multimodal Deepfake has attracted much research attention recently. While cross-attention shows the promising capacity for modelling the complicated dependencies between audio and video in multimodal Deepfake detection, it fails to learn accurate cross-modal patterns if audio and video are misaligned in the temporal dimension. Besides, most current multimodal Deepfake detectors only provide a binary classification label, lacking fine-grained localization to identify significant forgery in multiple dimensions (e.g. modal, time and spatial dimension). In this study, we propose a novel multimodal Deepfake detection framework named ForgeFinder, which goes beyond binary label prediction and achieves multi-grained forgery localization in modal and spatiotemporal dimensions. ForgeFinder incorporates both intra-modal and cross-modal inconsistencies to classify multimodal input. In detail, we adopt serial spatiotemporal self-attention (SSTSA) in the Intra-modal Inconsistency Explorer (Intra-MIE), which allows the temporal self-attention to run in the original dimension without bringing unacceptable computational complexity. In the Cross-modal Inconsistency Explorer (Cross-MIE), we propose the offset-shifted cross-attention (OSCA) by introducing a time offset term to the conventional cross-attention to mitigate the inaccuracy of cross-modal dependencies modelling brought by the temporal misalignment. By adopting the outputs of Intra-MIE for unimodal tasks, we identify the likelihood of modals being manipulated and localize tampered modals. At the same time, the attention weights of SSTSA can be visualized to pinpoint the temporal and spatial distribution of Deepfake manipulation. Therefore, for a single audio-video input sample, ForgeFinder not only tells the authenticity of the overall input but also localizes the modal, temporal sequence and spatial coordinates of significant forgery, significantly contributing to more comprehensive forensics analysis. The results of extensive experiments indicate that ForgeFinder achieves state-of-the-art detection performance as well as accurate forgery localization in modal and spatiotemporal dimensions. Furthermore, experiments on content generated by diffusion models (DMs) show that our model also effectively recognizes DM-generated content."

    "abstract": "Salient object detection (SOD) aims to distinguish salient regions from non-salient ones in an image. In real-world scenarios, factors such as depth variation and surface reflection can interfere with the model's judgment, while illumination uncertainty further intensifies this interference. As a result, the uncertainty in salient boundary detection increases, leading to false or missed detections. To core with uncertainty inherent to the problem, we introduce the concept of shadowed set, which is an effective method to process the uncertainty problem. In this paper, we have designed an illumination-aware feature integration network by conducting dual-input feature integration under the implicit assistance of illumination maps. Firstly, we devised a determination of pixel-level salient area module, which extract illumination maps based on Retinex theory and obtain the main area of salient object based on shadowed set as the implicit feature of illumination. Next, we constructed a dual-modal compression module to solve the problem of feature alignment, which can use the dual-stream structure to process RGB and auxiliary inputs. Finally, multi-stage contextual complementary module can effectively recover fine object edges, and we use the outputs from the last three stages to supervise the training of the entire model. The state originality came from our previous work on illumination maps and shadowed sets, and we creatively combined them with the SOD to process uncertainty of salient area. The experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits excellent performance on multiple RGB-based datasets, at the same time, it also demonstrates unique performance on underwater and challenging scenes."

This study developed a deep learning-based active EMI suppression method to overcome these limitations. Methods: Using a 68mT ULF MRI system, human body coupling was identified as a primary EMI pathway. We proposed EMIC-Net, a U-Net architecture incorporating Transformer and hybrid attention mechanisms, to learn the data-driven nonlinear mapping from sensing coil signals to radio-frequency (RF) receiver coil interference. Acquired data underwent phase and gain compensation prior to model training. The model's efficacy was validated through in vivo human brain imaging, comparing its performance with EDITER and standard CNN methods, and by assessing the impact of varying EMI coil numbers and training data volumes. Results: EMIC-Net effectively suppressed complex dynamic EMI. It restored image SNR from 2.35 dB to 17.63 dB, with significant PSNR and SSIM improvements. Image quality neared shielded acquisitions and surpassed comparative methods. Three EMI coils provided optimal balance, and the model showed data efficiency, requiring a small dataset for effective training. Conclusion: The EMIC-Net method accurately predicts and efficiently removes EMI in unshielded ULF MRI, offering superior performance and practicality.

Specifically, the multi-feature input module employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial–local features from DDM and deep semantic information from auxiliary data, enabling structural alignment and unified embedding of heterogeneous modalities. The cross-feature fusion module adopts mamba-based cross-feature fusion (MCF) block and transformer-based cross-feature fusion (TCF) block to achieve bidirectional interaction and deep coupling between one-dimensional auxiliary features and DDM image features. The physics-constrained retrieval module constructs a physics-consistency loss between measured and simulated GNSS-R surface reflectivity to regularize the training process. We further construct a multi-source GNSS-R dataset from cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS), Tianmu-1, and fengyun-3E (FY-3E) and validate against soil moisture active passive (SMAP). The joint use of multi-source GNSS-R data markedly improves retrieval accuracy, achieving R of 0.9805 and RMSE of 0.0176 cm³/cm³, demonstrating effectiveness at the regional scale."

Our study provides a rationale for the Ethereum transition by comparing and contrasting the volume of transactions, network performance through hash rate, and electricity consumption of Bitcoin and Ethereum in their PoW stages.With the help of both historical trend and predictive modelling in the form of the ARIMA framework, the obtained results showed that Bitcoin and Ethereum had different dynamics of growth under PoW, which was increased hash and energy expenditures but limited throughput. The ARIMA-based analysis achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 27.76, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 31.16, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 26.08, which provided an overall forecast accuracy of 73.9%. These measures show that there is a medium predictive reliability, and volatility is mainly caused by sudden changes in mining intensity and market forces. The predictions further indicated that under PoW, Ethereum would have experienced a steep rise in operational energy consumption and congestion of its network transactions, which would have weakened network sustainability.Results thus confirm that the switch of Ethereum to PoS was not only an environmental need but also a strategic optimization of a transaction to scale higher, operational overhead reduction, and alignment with sustainable and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals on a global scale. This piece leads to a better comprehension of the trade-offs between PoW and PoS, as well as the Ethereum consensus shift as the turning point in the evolution of blockchains—establishing a precedent of other cryptocurrencies that can select a balance between performance, security, and sustainability."

    "abstract": "Hugging provides psychological benefits and is common in supportive dialogue, leading to probabilistic models for a robot's intra-hug gestures (e.g., patting, rubbing). However, the psychological effects of this human-derived model have not been adequately verified. In this study, we aimed to clarify the psychological effects by implementing a model and a dialogue scenario for organizing user worries and goals in the huggable robot. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of the model-based system by comparing it with a system that performs random gestures according to uniform distributions without human characteristics. The results showed that participants who used the system with the model perceived the robot as significantly easier to use, felt that the robot was friendlier, and rated the overall goodness of the interaction session higher. Additionally, the model demonstrated a significant reduction in negative user comments regarding the frequency of gestures. Our quantitative and qualitative findings will help design interactions with huggable robots for mental health support."

    "abstract": "A DeepCAPA (Deep Learning for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)) framework is proposed to learn beamforming in CAPA systems. The beamforming optimization problem is first formulated, and it is mathematically proved that the optimal beamforming lies in the subspace spanned by users’ conjugate channel responses. Two challenges are encountered when directly applying deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving the formulated problem, i) both the input and output spaces are infinite-dimensional, which are not compatible with DNNs. The finite-dimensional representations of inputs and outputs are derived to address this challenge. ii) A closed-form loss function is unavailable for training the DNN. To tackle this challenge, two additional DNNs are trained to approximate the operations without closed-form expressions for expediting gradient back-propagation. To improve learning performance and reduce training complexity, the permutation equivariance properties of the mappings to be learned are proved. As a further advance, the DNNs are designed as graph neural networks to leverage the properties. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed DeepCAPA framework achieves higher spectral efficiency and lower inference complexity compared to existing numerical algorithms, ii) DeepCAPA approaches the performance upper bound of optimizing beamforming in the spatially discrete array systems as the number of antennas in a fixed-sized area tends toward infinity, and iii) DeepCAPA can be well-generalized to different system settings."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) has been reliant on the identification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) variations and lesions at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, light microscopy (LM) has been used to reveal spike- like projections that indicate pathological changes, whereas at the micro level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been employed to identify GBM thickening. However, qualitative diagnosis has been limited by inter-pathologist variability, creating the need for deep learning approaches capable of quantifying pathological changes and predicting MN progression. In this study, an AI-driven framework based on the Mamba model has been proposed, in which the area and proportion of spike- like projections are quantified at the macro level, and GBM thickness is segmented and measured at the micro level. Classical machine learning models are then applied to predict MN progression based on pathological indicators extracted through factor analysis. Unlike prior approaches, the framework has been designed to emulate the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating LM and TEM images for joint analysis. Experiments on an external dataset of 109 cases demonstrated strong performance in glomeruli classification, GBM segmentation, and MN progression prediction. These findings highlight the potential of multi-scale integrated quantification to provide objective, reproducible, and clinically interpretable assessment of MN progression."

    "abstract": "Typhoons, as intense atmospheric disturbances, are capable of significantly influencing ionospheric conditions, primarily through the excitation of gravity waves, which transfer energy into the ionosphere. This study investigates the characteristics of ionospheric disturbances during September 1–8, 2024, when Typhoon YAGI affected the study region. Data from GNSS ground stations, COSMIC-2 LEO satellites, and GUVI/TIMED observations, in conjunction with the HWM14 horizontal wind model, were utilized to examine the coupling mechanisms between typhoons and the ionosphere. The results indicate that Typhoon YAGI induced pronounced ionospheric disturbances along its trajectory, with propagation velocities ranging from 127 m/s to 339 m/s, consistent with those of medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs). Notably, within the fixed longitude range of 120°±5°E, the Beidou GEO TEC results based on the inversion of MEGX stations in the range of 0°N-25°N, as well as the COSMIC-2 electron density profiles, indicate that there is a clear north-south difference in the ionospheric response near the latitude of 17°N, with the northern region showing a positive response in terms of increased electron density, while the negative response in the south. In addition, the equatorial electric field (EEF) and equatorial electrojet (EEJ) analyses show that the electric and magnetic field activities remained relatively calm during the typhoon. However, on September 4, the southward turning of the IMF Bz triggered a westward PPEF, which significantly reduced the north-south asymmetry of the ionospheric response. Meanwhile, the background wind speed was estimated by the HWM14 model to be low, suggesting a relatively stable atmospheric background. The above results further reveal the coupling between AGWs and the ionosphere, as well as the modulation effect of the topography and background wind field on the disturbance propagation."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for real-time emergency response systems requires novel approaches to solving traffic congestion, ineffective routing, and cloud dependency delays. This paper describes MAESTRO—a multi-layered hierarchical architecture leveraging Software Defined Networking (SDN) and fog computing to improve ambulances routing in emergency response systems. The architecture integrates cloud, fog, and SDN layers and enables real-time decision making and efficient resource allocation through low-latency communication. This ensures ambulances are dispatched rapidly to accident locations and patients are admitted to hospitals in a timely manner. The fog computing layers are responsible for localized data processing, and the SDN layers dynamically control the routing of network traffic to achieve uninterrupted communication. The proposed algorithms are Ambulance Registration Protocol, Cloud-Fog-SDN Communication Algorithm, and Distributed SDN Traffic-Aware Routing Algorithm which provide continuous monitoring, ambulance-hospital coordination, and adaptive resilient routing in response to changing traffic conditions. Simulations in NS-2 and SUMO demonstrate higher response times, lower network latencies, and greater scalable improvements over traditional systems relying on cloud computing. The results validates MAESTRO’s ability to minimize the impact of congestion, optimize transit time, and deliver predictable routing to streamline emergency services."

In this study, we specifically focus on open thyroidectomy and employ a multi-viewpoint camera recording setup, in which six synchronized cameras capture the surgery from different angles simultaneously. We develop a supervised time-series prediction framework to automatically select the most informative camera views, ensuring better coverage of critical steps. Our model forecasts camera selections by extracting and fusing visual and semantic features from thyroidectomy videos using pre-trained models, followed by temporal modeling with TimeBlocks. We constructed a dataset of five thyroidectomy procedures with synchronized six-view recordings and conducted experiments. The results show that our method achieves stable accuracy compared with existing baselines and outperforms several mainstream time-series prediction models in this specific surgical scenario. This work provides an initial exploration of multi-view camera selection for thyroidectomy, with potential value for surgical video documentation and training.

However, single-channel methods often yield suboptimal results in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, when there is high reverberation, or in complex scenarios involving dynamic speakers, overlapping speech, or non-stationary noise. To address these issues, we propose a novel Visual-Informed Neural Beamforming Network (VI-NBFNet), which integrates microphone array signal processing and deep neural networks (DNNs) using multimodal input features. The proposed network leverages a pretrained visual speech recognition model to extract lip movements as input features, which serve for voice activity detection (VAD) and target speaker identification. The system is intended to handle both static and moving speakers by introducing a supervised end-to-end beamforming framework equipped with an attention mechanism. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed audiovisual system has achieved better SE performance and robustness for both stationary and dynamic speaker scenarios, compared to several baseline methods."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel deep learning methodology for automated anomaly detection in mining engine oil analysis using Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE). Traditional oil analysis depends heavily on expert judgment and fixed thresholds, which can cause subjective decisions and delays in failure detection. The CAE model was trained exclusively on 1,320 normal oil samples, each containing 32 physicochemical variables including wear metals, additives, contaminants, and degradation products. Data were normalized using Min-Max scaling and reshaped into 8x4x1 matrices to leverage the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional layers. The unsupervised learning approach enables the model to learn compressed representations of healthy oil characteristics without requiring labeled failure data. During training, the model demonstrated stable convergence with consistent reduction in reconstruction loss, indicating successful learning of normal pattern distributions. Anomaly detection was performed by calculating mean squared error (MSE) between original and reconstructed samples, with a threshold established using the 95th percentile of training error distribution. The methodology was validated using 1,346 failure samples labeled by specialists, achieving an accuracy of 81.87%. The approach provides several key advantages: elimination of dependency on scarce failure data through unsupervised learning, multivariate analysis capturing variable correlations often missed by traditional methods, variable-level error analysis enabling identification of specific parameters contributing to anomalies, and scalability for integration into real-time monitoring systems. Results demonstrate that the CAE successfully reconstructs normal samples with low error while producing significantly higher reconstruction errors for anomalous conditions, enabling early detection of potential mechanical failures before visible symptoms manifest."

It is performed to identify their user intention and preference to the e – learning system through sentimental analysis models. However, those models found to be inadequate and sparse as it performs forecasting of the user interest on basis of extracted sentiment alone. Hence it becomes mandatory to include annotation, domain knowledge, sensitiveness and subjective information along extracted social network data extraction towards forecasting and prediction analysis. In this article, deep learning architecture entitled as Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory model has been designed to incorporate annotation, sensitiveness, subjective information’s, sentiments and domain knowledge. Initially the pre-processing of the data is performed using stop word removal, stemming, tokenization and token weighting. Weighted tokens were employed to BERT model for contextual embedding. Those contextual embedded tokens were employed to Long Short-Term Memory based Recurrent Neural Network. Model composed of hidden layer to process the contextual token embedding to determine pattern and its relationship through activation function composed of set of rule, weight and bias values. Those extracted patterns were stored in the hidden states of the long short-term memory model using gating mechanism. Further recurrent connection is established with long short-term memory model to obtain long term dependency on processing its state information of the user sentiments. Those long-term dependencies of variable length patterns were processed effectively using SoftMax function in the dense layer to identify user interest (adoption rate to e-learning system) to the current input sequences along determining the polarity of the feature. Experimental analysis of the RNN+LTSM model is performed using twitter data in python environment and it exhibits better processing capabilities compared to conventional approaches. Further performance analysis of the model is performed to compute prediction accuracy and robustness of the model and it is evaluated that proposed model produces increased prediction accuracy on compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph embedding has recently advanced with two primary directions: self-supervised learning to address the scarcity of labeled data and metapath-free approaches to eliminate reliance on handcrafted, domain-specific metapaths. While metapath-free methods capture structural and semantic information directly from neighbor relationships, their performance often remains unstable across datasets and varying label scales, as they still rely on semi-supervised training. Conversely, self-supervised learning techniques, such as contrastive learning and masked graph autoencoders, achieve remarkable results by extracting information intrinsically from the data. However, these approaches often depend on predefined metapaths, which limit their ability to generalize and constrain representation quality. This paper proposes Relation-aware Heterogeneous Masked Graph Autoencoder (RHMGA), a novel metapathfree self-supervised learning framework that bridges these gaps. Our method integrates a semantic relation network with masked graph autoencoders to jointly reconstruct node features and relation-specific adjacency matrices. By capturing both structural and semantic information during aggregation and reconstruction, RHMGA enables robust self-supervised pretraining without predefined metapaths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance and adaptability across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets."

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide. The symptoms of ASD can vary greatly among individuals, influencing their communication, interaction, and learning capabilities. These variations in symptoms and severity make ASD a spectrum disorder, and diagnosis often proves challenging. Currently, no standardized laboratory-based diagnostic methods are available for ASD, and the disorder cannot be cured. However, early detection and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life and developmental outcomes for children with ASD.The complexity of diagnosing ASD lies in the diverse nature of its symptoms and the lack of comprehensive, multi-dimensional diagnostic tools. Existing methods primarily focus on evaluating social behaviors, language abilities, and cognitive functions, but they are often limited by the scope of the data and the reliance on single-modal approaches. For example, some diagnostic approaches use neuroimaging techniques or eye-tracking methods, but these single modalities fail to capture the full range of ASD-related signs. This highlights a critical gap in the current research and clinical practice, where multimodal approaches—integrating different types of data—are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and address the variability of ASD symptoms. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach for ASD detection using a hybrid optimization-based deep learning model, SBJSO CLeFTNet. The proposed method integrates both."

Our ODSC model is divided into two steps:-i) determining the significant and non-significant frames of surveillance video using the neural network approach YOLOv5s and YOLOv7-tiny ii) constructing the video of significant frames. Following a comprehensive analysis of the experimental outcomes, it is noted that YOLOv7 stands out with a remarkable detection accuracy of 99.5% on the COCO data set."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a procedure for the repurpose of batteries that have reached the end of their first life in consumer electronic devices and are considered electronic waste. Through extraction, inspection, testing, classification, and clustering process, it was found that 18650 -type lithium-ion cells can be recovered and prepared for second-life battery (SLB) applications. The currently low rate of reuse of this type of energy storage element represents an opportunity to develop circular economy scenarios. However, challenges such as the quantity of discarded batteries or cells, the heterogeneity in their electrical characteristics, and variability in performance indicators (such as State of Health, SOH) pose technical issues that can be addressed through engineering solutions. Within this context, a total of 93 18650 cells from an initial batch of 163 cells were studied. A testing procedure was developed that involved the collection of experimental data (charge and discharge tests), the construction of a dataset, the application of clustering techniques, evaluation of key performance metrics, and validation through a practical case. By applying clustering using the K-means algorithm, along with the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Index, it was determined that the optimal number of clusters for the dataset under study is <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$K=6$</tex>, with a silhouette score of 0.49. These results demonstrate that engineering-based approaches can contribute meaningfully to the goals of energy transition and sustainability."

This study evaluates the impact of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on reducing academic anxiety and enhancing psychological well-being among middle adolescent girls in Kerala, India. A total of 95 students aged 14– 15 were selected based on screening scores and assigned to experimental (n = 53) and control (n = 42) groups. The experimental group underwent a four-week structured mindfulness program. Standardized psychometric tools were administered at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up stages. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests and ANOVA, revealed significant improvements in general health and mindfulness scores and a reduction in anxiety symptoms in the intervention group, while control group scores worsened. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MBI as a scalable mental health intervention in school-based systems and support its application in adolescent well-being programs using quantitative outcome measures."

Space-time Hawkes processes provide a powerful framework to model such phenomena. This paper introduces a flexible parametric inference method to estimate the underlying kernel parameters involved in the intensity function of a space-time Hawkes process based on such data. Our approach combines three core components: 1) kernels with finite support, 2) discretization of the space-time domain, and 3) efficient (possibly approximate) precomputations. The inference method we propose then relies on a gradient-based solver that offers both computational efficiency and strong statistical performance. Alongside a detailed presentation of the algorithmic framework, we present numerical experiments on synthetic and real spatio-temporal data, offering solid empirical evidence of the validity and applicability of the proposed methodology."

Despite extensive research, fair bench-marking remains a significant challenge due to the unsupervised nature of anomaly detection. Hyperparameter selection, a crucial determinant of algorithm performance, is often overlooked or bi-ased, leading to inflated or misleading results. Current practices, including reliance on default configurations, random choices, or limited optimization, hinder reproducibility and impede progress. This work presents a novel pipeline for standardized hyperparameter optimization in anomaly detection. Leveraging a curated collection of nearly 500 datasets, the largest of its kind, our approach systematically optimizes over 80 hyperparameters for 13 widely used anomaly detection algorithms. Our comparison re-veals that the performance variance from hyperparameters often surpasses inter-algorithm differences, emphasizing the need for hyperparameter-specific evaluations. We establish a reproducible foundation for anomaly detection research by providing open-access datasets and code. Our findings not only challenge existing evaluation norms but also pave the way for more robust and reliable comparisons toward better anomaly detection research."

    "abstract": "Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines action trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while maintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus avoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy."

The utilization of fuzzy systems present a compelling avenue to enhance the robustness of image processing in the biomedical domain. This research explores the robustness of a deep neurofuzzy system (DNFS) for medical image classification to study the challenges posed by noisy medical images, utilizing the robust characteristics of fuzzy systems. Six types of noise – Gaussian, Salt and Pepper, Speckle, Blur, Contrast, and Inverse, were used to investigate the DNFS performance under diverse conditions. Adversarial attacks were implemented to evaluate the model’s susceptibility to perturbations. The DNFS was trained and tested on seven distinct biomedical image classification datasets: colon pathology, Dermatoscope, retinal OCT, chest Xray, breast ultrasound, blood cell microscope, and abdominal CT. Comparative analyses were conducted with state-of-the-art models. Results indicated that the DNFS achieved similar accuracy to these benchmark models on original images, and exhibited superior average accuracy on noisy data, depicting the model’s resilience to noise compared to other models. This finding underscores the efficacy of deep neuro-fuzzy models in handling diverse noise types commonly encountered in medical imaging. The robust performance was evident across multiple datasets, reinforcing the generalizability of the DNFS approach. The study also delved into the vulnerability of DNFS and the benchmark models to adversarial attacks, showcasing the weakness of deep learning."

This paper presents a deep learning framework for underwater debris segmentation using YOLOv12s architecture in combination with Recursive Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (R-ELAN) and FlashAttention to increase feature extraction and computational efficiency. The proposed model leverages R-ELAN to maximize multiscale feature representation, hence enhancing hierarchical information flow. Flash Attention lowers latency without compromising accuracy by accelerating the attention mechanism. On a fresh dataset of underwater garbage including both synthetic and real-world images, the algorithm is trained and tested. Experimental data demonstrate better segmentation accuracy, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and inference speed when compared to state-of- the-art segmentation models. The proposed approach offers a practical and real-time means of tracking seabed debris, therefore promoting advancements in environmental monitoring and self-sufficient marine uses."

To address the challenge, this article proposes a novel dc offset calibration technique that enables joint circle fitting of multiple segmented radar signal traces under approximately uniform maximum amplitude modulation. The proposed technique preserves amplitude and phase relationships through geometric space transformation, adaptively processes noise via a dual-mode fitting mechanism for dc offset calibration, and enhances robustness by integrating Huber loss residual computation with threshold-based optimization and averaged positioning. Validated across simulations and experiments in both lab and clinical environments, the proposed technique reduces demodulation errors by 10–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1000\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> (for a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$0.004\\lambda $</tex-math> </inline-formula> displacement) compared to conventional LS single-segment circle fitting under comparable SNR conditions.

However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a critical neuroimaging observation instrument to understand brain dynamics, yet accurately modeling the dynamic functional connectivity inherent in EEG signals remains an open challenge. The existing statistically based coarse-grained associations based on fixed physical distances or static graph structures cannot reflect the spatio-temporal specificity of dynamic functional interactions between brain regions. The secondary computation based on threshold or attention mechanisms to eliminate redundant connections cannot dynamically obtain global structural changes at a fine-grained level, ignoring the rapid dynamic reorganization of brain region functions and lacking a fast response to input correlations. More recently, state space models have been shown to excel at processing long data sequences. However, directly applying such models to EEG data is far from satisfactory due to the lack of functional connectivity modeling between brain regions. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Functional Graph Structure Learning framework (DFGSL) to capture the dynamic functional connectivity with state space models at a finer-grained level. The proposed DFGSL first constructs dynamic similarity probability maps to reveal information exchange between brain regions. Then, we simulate the entire dynamic evolution of dynamic functional connectivity at a finer-grained level through a selective state space model. By calculating the dynamic similarity probability between selected states, we obtain a compact state representation to describe the context of the dynamic evolution of brain state and reveal potential neural mechanisms. Empirical experiments on three benchmark datasets with different populations, electrode numbers, and brain states show that the proposed DFGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong functional modeling capabilities."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we take a close look at the efficient differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) problem through the lens of data pruning. A key insight is that the core samples in the pruned dataset can be interpreted as support vectors for networks to make informed decisions. Therefore, we introduce ProtoNAS, an innovative prototypical data pruning method that dynamically and explicitly measures the prototypical distance of each data sample to its class-specific clustering centroid (i.e., prototype). These prototypes are dynamically updated on-the-fly throughout the search phase, enabling flexible data pruning that adjusts with the architectures and network parameters. Compared to conventional cross-entropy-based or Euclidean-based distances, the prototypical distance not only considers the distance between a sample and its class-specific prototype, but also the relative distances to the prototypes of other classes in the embedding space, facilitating more precise score assignment. Furthermore, beyond sample pruning, we introduce a class pruning policy aimed at masking the classes with the lowest average scores. This additional policy is designed to further expedite the NAS without compromising the performance of the final searched architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on NAS-Bench-201 and NAS-Bench-1Shot1 search spaces demonstrate that ProtoNAS can achieve a significant 90% pruning rate with minimal performance trade-offs or even improved performance when applied to DARTS and its variants, such as PC-DARTS and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\beta$</tex-math></inline-formula>-DARTS.

    "abstract": "An extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) aided communication system is studied. Although XL-IRS can effectively combat the double path-loss attenuation, the large aperture size introduces significant near-field effects. The complex near-field propagation and large number of XL-IRS elements can lead to optimality and complexity challenges in beam focusing design. Focusing on a spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem, two unsupervised learning based algorithms are conceived for the joint optimization of base station and XL-IRS beam focusing, which operate without pre-training and exhibit strong robustness. Specifically, a dense-connected dilated autoencoder meta learning (DDAML) algorithm is proposed to achieve high SE by utilizing dense connections, while reasonably designing an autoencoder to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, considering a need for low execution time in practical applications, a convolutional dilated autoencoder meta learning (CDAML) algorithm is also proposed to further reduce computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed DDAML algorithm achieves the highest SE, while the proposed CDAML algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity at the cost of limited SE loss. Moreover, the two proposed algorithms also demonstrate remarkable robustness in XL-IRS-aided near-field communications."

    "abstract": "Power distribution network is a critical link of Power grid throughout the world, where overhead power lines transport electricity from substation to the consumers end. Short circuit faults are common and contribute to more than 50% for the total faults in distribution lines, mainly due to insulation failures, vegetation growth, birding and line intrusion. Such non-clearing faults require manual faulted span retrieval which results in longer outage times and enormous human effort. This work presents and demonstrate a complete system level approach to automates manual fault localization by non-contact magnetic sensing, its processing and rapid reporting of faulted span length. This results in reduced outage time for customers, less man hours of patrolling, and improved safety of line personnel. To test and validate, this article further designs a novel Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) to track weak magnetic signatures radiated from overhead lines in a non-contact arrangement to detect and identify distribution line status. The state from deployed RTUs is further transmitted to cloud-based algorithm to identify faulted span length. The RTU is developed to cater for real world modalities such as ease of installation at a distance from live conductors, and ability to withstand geomagnetic, ferromagnetic as well as intrinsic sensor noise. The presented system is implementable to radial as well as meshed based modern power systems with an inbuilt mechanism to prevent false alarm in events of back feeding and inrush current. High voltage lab and extensive on-field testing verifies the overall system efficacy to successfully localize the faulted span length."

Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration. We strongly recommend readers check out our case studies, demo video, and source code at https://nli4volvis.github.io/."

This paper proposes an assessment method for interface operation workload and interaction efficiency based on task network simulation. This method constructs a task network model using hierarchical task analysis techniques, defines the workload and time values of each task unit according to the VACP workload model and GOMS model, and ultimately obtains the evaluation results of interface operation workload and interaction efficiency through discrete-event simulation of the task network. Taking the target allocation task as an example, the paper analyzes the changes in operational workload and operation time before and after interface optimization. The analysis results show a close similarity to actual operation time and operational workload obtained from subjective scales, indicating that this method can effectively quantify the operation workload and interaction efficiency within specific task processes at a low cost, providing quantitative support for evaluating the effects of interface optimization design."

In this context, this research proposes a solution that includes the application of Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and the 5S methodology with an ergonomic approach based on anthropometry, as musculoskeletal disorders also contribute to production delays due to worker absenteeism or fatigue. Various studies have applied the 5S methodology in conjunction with SLP. However, none of them have taken this important ergonomic approach into account, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy work environment. The objective of this proposal is to improve the production process by eliminating unnecessary activities, reducing transportation times, and optimizing workstation design. As a result of the implementation, a significant increase in the on-time delivery rate was achieved, reaching 90%. Through the analysis, it was concluded that the application of these methods with an ergonomic focus has created synergy and enabled improvements in the production process by considering good working conditions for employees and the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)."

    "abstract": "Model-driven engineering problems often require complex model transformations (MTs), i.e., MTs that are chained in extensive sequences. Pertinent examples of such problems include model synchronization, automated model repair, and design space exploration. Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often infeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate these issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial and error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL methods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations, human guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach and technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided by potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to be mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal MT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain, substantially improves RL performance, and results in more effi-cient development of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and timeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven human-in-the-loop engineering methods."

Existing methodologies for epidemic forecasting often encounter limitations such as reliance on static datasets, inadequate integration of multivariate factors, and a lack of real-time visualization capabilities. These constraints hinder timely decision-making and resource allocation in response to emerging outbreaks. This research introduces a comprehensive framework for real-time epidemic prediction and mapping, integrating machine learning, time-series modelling, and geospatial visualization tools. The methodology combines Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models for predictive accuracy, ARIMA and Vector Autoregression (VAR) for time-series trend analysis, and Folium for interactive geospatial visualization. These components are applied to analyse the spread of 15 diseases across Indian states, leveraging epidemiological, environmental, and demographic data to identify high-risk regions and forecast outbreak dynamics. Our framework addresses the limitations of traditional approaches by incorporating multivariate analysis, enabling real-time visualizations, and achieving high prediction accuracy. The results demonstrate improved forecasts for diseases like Dengue Fever, Hepatitis B, and Leptospirosis, facilitating targeted public health interventions. This work advances the state-of-the-art in epidemic modelling by providing actionable insights, improving response times, and enhancing resource optimization for epidemic control."

Addressing these challenges, this work presents a HRI system based on mixed reality and assistive haptic feedback for remote navigation. The proposed approach integrates a digital twin developed in Unity, connected to a real mobile robot via the ROS 2 middleware. The haptic interface, implemented using the Falcon Novint device, provides tactile feedback to the operator based on the detection of physical obstacles and virtual ones (simulated within the Unity environment). The system employs a detection ellipse to compute directional forces that assist the operator's decision-making during navigation without compromising their autonomy. The pilot study with four volunteers followed an experimental protocol that included familiarization and testing sessions, during which both objective and subjective data were collected to evaluate system performance, workload (NASA-TLX), and presence perception (PQ). The results indicated no collisions among participants, regardless of their familiarity with haptic technologies and virtual environments.

The system leverages a machine learning model based on the SVM algorithm, implemented on an STM32 Nucleo U575ZI microcontroller using NanoEdge AI Studio. By acquiring current signals via the DMA module and employing Fast Fourier Transform for feature extraction, the system effectively distinguishes between seven distinct domestic loads: iron, vacuum cleaner, kettle, printer, fan, blender, and a “no load” state. This solution achieves a remarkable 99.88% precision while maintaining exceptional resource efficiency, requiring only 2.8 KB of RAM and 2.9 KB of Flash memory. Furthermore, rapid classification is achieved with an execution time of just 0.7 ms, making it ideally suited for real-time applications. The fusion of lightweight machine learning and efficient signal processing demonstrates a practical and effective approach to intelligent energy monitoring in smart homes.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a critical performance gap in a Peruvian footwear SME: the low On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery rate, which averaged only 74.26% in 2023. This shortfall led to financial losses equivalent to 9.42% of annual revenue and negatively affected customer satisfaction and operational reliability. To analyze the problem, industrial engineering tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Pareto Analysis, and ABC Inventory Classification were applied, identifying major inefficiencies including prolonged setup times, frequent unscheduled downtimes, and errors in picking operations. Compared with existing literature, similar issues have been addressed using Lean Manufacturing methodologies in sectors such as metalworking and food processing. However, these approaches often overlook environmental performance. Therefore, this study proposes a Lean Green innovation model tailored to low-automation SMEs. The solution integrates SMED, Autonomous Maintenance, RFID-based inventory tracking, and sustainable practices such as LED lighting and polymer waste reduction in mixing operations. The proposed model is projected to improve OTIF by 15 percentage points, reduce setup time by 50%, cut energy consumption by 35%, and decrease carbon footprint by 77%. The results suggest that Lean Green offers a scalable, cost-effective strategy for achieving both operational excellence and environmental sustainability in the footwear manufacturing sector."

    "abstract": "With rapid urbanization and economic growth, water pollution has become a major environmental concern, especially in marine ecosystems. Plastic waste, in particular, poses serious threats due to its persistence and harmful effects on human health and aquatic life. Effective detection and measurement of underwater waste are therefore essential. Conventional computer vision and deep learning methods have been applied for classifying underwater debris, but they often fail to achieve robust segmentation and generalization. To address this, a lightweight deep segmentation and recognition framework using the YOLOv11 model is proposed for underwater waste monitoring. The model processes video data from underwater sensors by converting sequences into image frames. Each frame is analyzed using the YOLOv11 architecture, comprising backbone, neck, and head components. The backbone, built on a pretrained convolutional neural network, extracts features from image frames, which are aggregated in the neck and passed to the head for segmentation and recognition. Classification is performed across multiple categories, including plastics, glass, and metals. A high-resolution annotated marine dataset was used for training to enhance recognition of diverse pollution types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and efficiency in detecting and quantifying both floating and submerged debris compared to conventional methods. Further improvement is obtained through transfer learning, enhancing detection in varied underwater conditions. The system’s automated nature reduces human intervention, offering a scalable, real-time solution for ocean pollution monitoring and contributing to sustainable waste management and marine conservation efforts."

Anomalies can manifest in diverse and often subtle ways and may not be directly evident from readily observable metrics. This work proposes a novel approach that leverages causal discovery to identify critical process parameters and their underlying causal relationships. By focusing on causal mechanisms, this approach aims to reduce the complexity and enhance the interpretability and robustness of anomaly detection in the industrial context. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world blast furnace plant, where it demonstrated the potential to uncover interdependencies, detect anomalies, their key drivers, and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of the process. The results show that modeling based on the causal information decreases the complexity of the model-based anomaly detection, validating the applicability of this approach in other fields of science and engineering."

In this work, the path is composed by line segments and circular arcs, which is generated by the team's visibility-graph-based path planner. However, this is not a limitation of the developed algorithm, which remains applicable to more general paths. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTVP approach: the variant that considers angular acceleration constraints achieved a 1.1% improvement in navigation time over a baseline P controller with saturations, while the variant that ignores this constraint achieved an 8.57% improvement. This work contributes with a solution to the velocity profile determination for trajectory planning in the SSL environment."

    "abstract": "As global demand for seafood continues to escalate, smart aquaculture systems have emerged as a vital solution for ensuring sustainable food production while preserving aquatic ecosystems. Maintaining optimal water quality is essential for the health, growth, and survival of aquatic species; however, conventional monitoring techniques, such as manual water sampling, are often labor-intensive, prone to human error, and incapable of providing real-time feedback. To overcome these limitations, this research introduces an advanced IoT-enabled deep learning framework that continuously monitors and forecasts critical water quality parameters in aquaculture environments. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our system delivers immediate assessments of water conditions, classifying them into \"optimal,\" \"suboptimal,\" or \"critical\" categories to support proactive management decisions. Specifically, CNNs are employed to detect intricate patterns in sensor data, enhancing the accuracy of pH and dissolved oxygen level predictions — two of the most vital indicators of aquatic health. The system harnesses data from sensors monitoring pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity, enabling predictive analytics that anticipate unfavorable trends before they escalate. Validation using publicly available datasets shows that our model outperforms traditional approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), in terms of both predictive accuracy and reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). With its scalability and real-time monitoring capabilities, the proposed framework offers a promising pathway toward more efficient, sustainable aquaculture practices. Future developments aim to incorporate disease outbreak prediction and more complex ecological variables, further strengthening decision-making in aquaculture management."

    "abstract": "A known technique to enable inexperienced users to apply sophisticated machine learning models is Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). AutoML can be used to determine appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters to specific problem settings. Typically, Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) results in hyperparameters of a single algorithm, optimizing a given objective function. In the domain of automated clustering, the problem inherently has a non-unique solution, often yielding multiple valid algorithms. This multiplicity arises due to the exis-tence of various clustering algorithms, each employing different heuristics and optimization strategies as well as the subjectivity of the clustering notion. Consequently, the search space for finding an optimal clustering solution is highly complex, comprising the selection and parameter tuning of multiple algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the problem of Multi Algorithm Selection, which aims to find an appropriate set of algorithms of unknown size along with their respective hyperparameters, for automated clustering. To this end, we propose various search space strategies and utilize them as inputs for several well-known HPO algorithms to determine an optimal set of clustering algorithms. The resulting pipelines are evaluated on a number of publicly available, synthetic datasets to assess the ability of our methods to find interesting clustering sets. The strategy used to model a complex search space significantly influences the quality of the resulting model. Furthermore, clustering sets generated by means of our proposal yield higher quality than those created using naive approaches."

A computationally efficient trajectory prediction module estimates future target locations based on historical motion states and normalized velocities. To address control latency and spatial contention, a scheduling strategy is developed to assign capture timestamps by jointly modeling PTZ adjustment time and global target distribution. The system achieves an average throughput of 12 FPS on 2560×1440 RTSP streams, ensuring real-time responsiveness under constrained camera resources. Experimental evaluations show that MTDCF significantly enhances capture success rate and image resolution, outperforming baseline methods in both prediction accuracy and scheduling effectiveness.

However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system's usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel downlink multiple access system with a multi-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, inspired by the underlying principles of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (H-QAM) based multiple access (QAMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the proposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared symbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint symbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the transmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray mapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition to avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently demodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based on closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other competing alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We carry out system optimization and determine the achievable rate region. Numerical results show that the proposed system achieves superior performance compared with benchmark schemes employing SIC-free receivers, and further demonstrates competitive results across various performance metrics even relative to benchmark schemes relying on SIC-based receivers. The proposed scheme is attractive to 6G and IoT applications where the increased system complexity is at the transmitter while the receivers maintain low complexity."

The appeal of micromobility lies in its efficiency, flexibility, and eco-friendliness. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of micromobility, with a focus on its seamless integration into Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) through the adoption of advanced technologies and emerging processes. This study emphasizes the critical role of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) applications. It highlights their significance in facilitating real-time communication through Vehicle-to Everything (V2X) message exchanges and efficient traffic management. This is ensured by communication modes such as ITS-G5, based on the IEEE 802.11p, a predefined standard of vehicular communication, and mobile networks, enabling seamless connectivity and data exchange. Furthermore, this paper discusses the integration of advanced technologies, such as geofencing and geolocation, to enhance the management and supervision of micromobility vehicles. Finally, in such an environment, considering energy consumption is essential to ensure efficient and sustainable operation of the system.

    "abstract": "Sparse tensors are prevalent in real-world applications, often characterized by their large-scale, high-order, and high dimensional nature. Directly handling raw tensors is impractical due to the significant memory and computational overhead involved. The current mainstream approach involves compressing or decomposing the original tensor. One popular tensor decomposition algorithm is the Tucker decomposition. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale Tucker decomposition typically relax the original optimization problem into multiple convex optimization problems to ensure polynomial convergence. Unfortunately, these algorithms tend to converge slowly. In contrast, tensor decomposition exhibits a simple optimization landscape, making local search algorithms capable of converging to a global (approximate) optimum much faster. In this paper, we propose the FastTuckerPlus algorithm, which decomposes the original optimization problem into two non-convex optimization problems and solves them alternately using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method. Furthermore, we introduce cuFastTuckerPlusTC, a fine-grained parallel algorithm designed for GPU platforms, leveraging the performance of tensor cores. This algorithm minimizes memory access overhead and computational costs, surpassing the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 2× to 8× improvement in convergence speed and a 3× to 5× improvement in per-iteration execution speed compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "In this work, we address the problem of drift mitigation in the estimation of trajectories from inertial data using deep neural networks. We propose two methods to reduce the error. The first method applies the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) algorithm to the trajectories estimated by various deep-learning-based approaches (6DOF Odometry, IONet, RoNIN, and VRIO). The second method shifts the reference frame from local to global, eliminating the need for orientation estimation. We leverage multiple publicly available datasets (OxIOD, EUROC, RIDI, RoNIN, and VRD), all of which provide inertial readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) alongside corresponding ground-truth pose measurements. Our experiments demonstrate that EWT can successfully reduce position estimation error by removing low-frequency drift components (i.e., mode zero) from the estimated trajectory using the neural network. In the OxIOD and VRD datasets, subtracting mode zero aligns the estimated trajectory with the ground truth and reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE). However, in other datasets, improvement is mainly observed along the gravity axis, while performance might degrade on other axes. For evaluating the second method, we modify the 6DOF Odometry and IONet frameworks to operate in a global reference frame, removing the need to estimate the orientation, which simplifies the learning target and the loss function design, and yields better accuracy in several datasets."

    "abstract": "The parallel connection of interleaved H-bridges (HBs) is widely used in high-current, low-ripple applications, such as particle accelerators and nuclear fusion systems, to handle the high-energy requirements and the four-quadrant functioning of the power converters. This parallel HBs approach leverages low-power-rated semiconductors, while the interleaving technique offers output current ripple cancellation. The connection of a generic number of parallel HBs sharing a common DC- bus is indicated as the common DC- bus configuration (CDC), whereas the configuration with galvanically isolated DC-buses is referred to as the split DC- bus configuration (SDC). This paper investigates both CDC and SDC topologies and compares the HB currents, the RMS of the HB currents, the RMS of the non-zero frequency component of the HB current, and the associated losses of the power converter. Specifically, the RMS of the non-zero frequency component of the current in CDC, which differs from that in SDC due to the presence of circulating current, is validated experimentally over specific sets of parallel HBs and gain ratios. The normalization of the RMS current in CDC is discussed to decouple the effect of the circulating current from the output current. Highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of CDC and SDC, an algorithm is proposed to automatically select the most appropriate topology for the power converter. The functionality of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through illustrative design cases and validated numerically under varying system parameters and algorithm inputs, highlighting its robustness and adaptability."

    "abstract": "This article presents an online neuro-dynamic programming (NDP)-based optimal coordinated control method of biped reconfigurable robots (BRRs) under multilayer nested learning structure. Based on the requirements of walking task, the dynamic model of BRRs is established, decomposed into two operating modes: the swing phase and the support phase. To ensure stability during the support phase, a polyhedral friction cone approximation policy is employed to describe the distribution of plantar force, with corresponding reference values obtained through a quadratic programming (QP) algorithm. A novel cost function is constructed, incorporating the interaction forces between BRRs, torso, and ground, effectively reflecting the BRRs’ stability and coordinated control performance. Then, a functional link neural network (FLNN) identifier is designed to compensate for inherent model uncertainties. Leveraging the NDP framework, a near-optimal coordinated controller is obtained through the actor–critic dual-layer neural network (NN), enabling high-performance and stable planar walking of BRRs. Furthermore, the Lyapunov stability method is utilized to demonstrate that the tracking error of closed-loop BRRs is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the multilayer nested learning-based optimal coordinated control method is validated through experiments conducted on the self-designed claw-type BRR platform."

    "abstract": "Cell state discovery is crucial for understanding biological systems and enhancing medical outcomes. A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system CellScout–in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states."

    "abstract": "Maps are essential to news media as they provide a familiar way to convey spatial context and present engaging narratives. However, the design of journalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance multiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy, tight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists often come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and data science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While previous studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process employed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific research questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do editorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we collected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news articles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result, we created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both properties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features of maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured interviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily. Through these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made by editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected the practitioners' feedback on our design space to externally validate it. With these results, we aim to provide researchers and journalists with empirical data to design and study journalistic maps."

    "abstract": "Standard 5G new radio (NR) reference signals (RSs), such as demodulation reference signal (DMRS) and positioning reference signal (PRS), have been proposed for sensing; however, they exhibit structural limitations, such as evenly spaced or sparse patterns, that degrade target detection, introduce ghost targets, and reduce the probability of detecting weak targets in multi-target scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a sensing-oriented resource element (RE) allocation scheme that optimizes the time-domain spacing of RSs at the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol level, thereby maximizing the detection probability for closely spaced targets while maintaining sparse recovery constraints. The optimized RE pattern is further processed with the complex approximate message passing (CAMP) algorithm, a compressed sensing (CS) method, to generate high-resolution range-Doppler (RD) maps. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pattern significantly increases the peak-to-aliasing lobe ratio and increases the probability of detecting weak targets compared to conventional RS patterns in multi-target scenarios."

Drawing inspiration from the structural information of objects to enhance the completion, we introduce an innovative weakly-supervised shape completion method leveraging structural decomposition without the necessity of SDFs during training. By representing objects as abstract structural frameworks and part details, our method initiates by forecasting the structure of the input partial point clouds, and individually restore each component through part decomposition completion and generation. Extracted part details are represented in images, which are porous and incomplete. Hence, we utilize a completion network to complete such details. For multiple results generation, a diffusion-based generation network is employed to generate a variety of details for the missing areas. The predicted structure and details are subsequently converted back into meshes, yielding the complete results. Since the details are depicted in images, our approach eliminates the need for SDFs during the training phase, achieving weakly-supervision. We conduct extensive comparisons on both artificial and real-scan datasets, demonstrating an average improvement of over 38.1% compared to the prior method, and achieving SOTA performance."

    "abstract": "Motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) decoding demonstrates significant potential for paralysis rehabilitation, and its generalization capability is often compromised by intersubject variability and scarcity of labeled target domain data. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach for unsupervised domain adaptation problem. However, existing implementations suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient feature extraction and overlooking the guiding role of unlabeled target data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a dual-attention meta-learning framework (DA-META) with model-agnostic architecture in this paper. The framework comprises three stages: meta-task construction, guided meta-training, and fine-tuning-free meta-testing. In the guided meta-training stage, DA-META incorporates two key attention mechanisms: an enhanced temporal attention module for effective feature extraction, and a cosine similarity-based attention module to leverage the guidance of target domain. Using EEGNet as the backbone network, DA-META achieves mean classification accuracies of 68.04% and 76.61% on self-collected datasets from patients and healthy subjects, and 73.29% and 80.93% on the public BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. When employing EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and EEG Conformer as backbone networks respectively, the framework achieves accuracy improvements of 5.17%, 2.56%, and 0.85% on the 2a dataset, compared to the baseline. These results demonstrate the framework's superior ability to handle inter-subject variability and its significant potential to improve practical applicability."

As software evolves, continuous changes could deviate its architecture from the original design, leading to architecture degradation that causes a decline in software quality. Architecture refactoring becomes necessary to address or mitigate architecture degradation for improving overall quality. Although researchers have developed various architecture refactoring tools and techniques, there has been limited research on how architecture refactoring is practiced in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study by analyzing posts from Stack Overflow to understand architecture refactoring in practice. Through our analysis of 694 posts with 3,468 discussion threads, we identified 12 types of architecture refactoring based on two classification dimensions. Additionally, we categorized architecture problems faced by practitioners and explored their corresponding refactoring solutions. Furthermore, we revealed six potential risks that may result from architecture refactoring. We believe that our study can provide valuable insights for practitioners to perform architecture refactoring effectively. The findings can serve as a foundation for future research and offer practical guidance to improve architecture quality."

    "abstract": "Active distribution networks (ADNs) are cyber-physical systems. The effectiveness of physical topology reconfiguration (PTR), crucial for ensuring the security operation of ADNs during physical system failures, heavily depends on support from the cyber system, especially the cyber network. Consequently, when cyber system failures occur simultaneously, PTR performance is severely compromised. To mitigate the impact of concurrent failures in both systems, termed cyber-physical failures, this paper proposes a cyber-physical collaborative reconfiguration (CPCR) scheme to ensure the security operation of ADNs under such conditions. In the implementation of CPCR, security risk reduction and load loss minimization, the two contradictory entities, should be considered simultaneously. To this end, a comprehensive indicator is constructed to quantify and balance both entities. Then, to achieve dynamic adaptation between communication resources in cyber system and PTR services in physical system, a CPCR problem is formulated. Specifically, for physical system, a distributionally robust PTR model considering source-load uncertainty with the objective of minimizing comprehensive indicator is constructed to enhance the operation robustness of ADNs. For cyber system, a cyber network reconfiguration model considering PTR requirements is constructed to ensure real-time and reliable transmission of PTR commands. Finally, to meet the real-time requirements of emergency control, a particle swarm optimization-assisted multi-task edge convolutional graph neural network-non-autoregressive network (PME-NAR) is proposed to solve the CPCR problem quickly and accurately. Numerical tests are conducted on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CPCR scheme."

    "abstract": "Independent Cart Systems present diagnostic challenges owing to their nonstationary dynamics, frequent speed reversals, and complex bearing arrangements. This study introduces a fully unsupervised and lightweight diagnostic framework for bearing fault detection based on a novel Iterative Weighted Compact Clustering Transformation. This method restructures dispersed or overlapping feature distributions into compact, linearly separable clusters without requiring class labels or model training. This transformation enhances feature separability in reduced-dimensional spaces, thereby improving the effectiveness of anomaly detection and clustering algorithms. In contrast to global Gaussianization or density-homogenizing transformations, the proposed algorithm achieves class-preserving compaction through a provably convergent, non-expansive update with a computational cost of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ND</i>), thereby enhancing separability without the need for labels.

Owing to its deterministic formulation and low computational overhead, the proposed approach is well suited for real-time deployment in industrial environments where labeled data are scarce. The originality of this study lies in its introduction of a distribution-reshaping transformation that strengthens separability under highly variable operating conditions."

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a covert communication scenario with multiple friendly interference nodes. The goal is to hide a legitimate communication link from a transmitter to a receiver under a warden’s surveillance. Firstly, we propose a novel strategy for generating artificial noise (AN) signals and formulate a corresponding design problem, aiming to minimize the adverse effects of AN on the legitimate receiver while enhancing communication covertness. Specifically, we optimize the basis matrix for AN signal space using statistical information of the involved channel coefficients, when precise channel state information are unavailable. Secondly, we analyze the geometric structure of the AN basis matrix constraint and transform the nonconvex problem into an unconstrained problem on the complex Stiefel manifold. Additionally, we develop a specialized Riemannian Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (R-SVRG) algorithm to tackle the problem. In the algorithm, the problem is solved with lower computational complexity compared to full gradient algorithm. Thirdly, we prove that the customized R-SVRG algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to be converge and that the solution is a stationary point of the optimization problem. In the end, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AN signal generation strategy over traditional AN in terms of achieving higher covert communication rate."

A simple and extensible calibration method is introduced to accurately synthesize arbitrary load impedances presented to the device under test (DUT). The system’s flexibility is demonstrated through three measurement scenarios: return loss measurements of a 3-D-printed horn antenna and small-signal gain measurements of the commercial RF power amplifier (PA) QPA9501, utilizing the setup as a two-port VNA and active load–pull measurements of the same PA at 5.4 GHz.

Two key phenomena are analyzed: the reflected field, which exhibits a smooth transition between partial beam reflections across the discontinuity, and the excitation of surface waves (SW), which is shown to be significantly stronger—by orders of magnitude—than conventional SW excitation mechanisms. We formulate the exact Sommerfeld-Malyuzhinets (SM) double spectral integral solution, and then derive a uniform asymptotic solution applicable to near-discontinuity beam incidence. The asymptotic solution demonstrates excellent agreement with numerical evaluations of the exact integral and offers a compact representation of the underlying wave physics. The strong SW excitation produced by collimated beams incident near the discontinuity suggests potential applications in SW antenna systems, including illumination by multiple remote collimated sources, highlighting the significance of the results."

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of smart meters has created significant opportunities for applying artificial intelligence technologies to power system tasks. However, the high cost of data annotation limits the effectiveness of traditional supervised learning in this domain, making self-supervised learning an attractive alternative. In this article, we propose PowerDiffuser, a novel self-supervised learning strategy tailored for power load signals. By leveraging a diffusion model framework, PowerDiffuser integrates two mainstream self-supervised paradigms, namely contrastive learning and reconstruction-based learning, which enables the model to effectively capture both periodic patterns and local features. To address the overfitting issues commonly observed in generic time-series feature extractors when applied to power load tasks, we design two modular spatiotemporal feature extractors specifically engineered to handle samples with varying complexity levels. In addition, we adapt the involution operator to better align with the unique characteristics of power load signals. Extensive experiments on the ISMCBT, ETTh and REDD datasets demonstrate that PowerDiffuser consistently outperforms both time-series general models and existing self-supervised learning strategies across diverse downstream power load tasks. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of the proposed modules and highlight the effectiveness of transforming 1-D load signals into 2-D periodicity-based representations as a preprocessing step."

To this end, several identification methods combining payload identification methods with online identification techniques are proposed and compared. The passive behavior of the human joint is modeled by classical spring damper-inertia equations. Monte Carlo simulations are first carried out to compare the expected performance of the proposed methods. Next, experimental validations are conducted on two robotic systems interacting with elements simulating a passive human operator with varying parameters. Results show that the proposed identification combining a separate identification of robot and human parameters with an exponentially-weighted past recursive least squares method gives the best overall results in terms of accuracy. A preliminary example of identifying the wrist mechanical impedance of two able-bodied subjects during f lexion/extension motions is provided. The proposed methods show promising results in continuous monitoring of the human operator's state during physical human-robot interaction, which could be used to detect long-term fatigue or rehabilitation performance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes, for the first time, a spherically conformal transmit-array antenna (SCTA) with high gain and two-dimensional (2D) steerable directional beams for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based air-to-ground emergency communication applications. The multifaced conformal antenna architecture consists of 5×5 identical-sized planar transmitsubarrays (TSAs), each integrating 6×6 cross-dipole-shaped elements of metasurface. When illuminated by a feed source, each TSA generates a distinctively oriented sub-beam. By continuously rotating the feed source to illuminate the selected TSAs, the proposed SCTA synthesizes a high-directivity beam and achieves continuous 2D beam steering capability and achieves continuous 2D beam steering capability. A terrestrial-inspired spherical topology is proposed with strategic array arrangement, mapping all TSAs onto predefined latitude-longitude coordinates across the doubly curved surface. A vector synthesis method is proposed to obtain the beam direction distribution for all TSAs. Due to the distinct beam directions of the TSAs and their discontinuous spatial locations, abrupt compensation phases calculated at the inter-TSA boundaries cause severe performance degradation. To tackle this issue, a phase smoothing method is proposed to enhance the gain and suppress the sidelobe levels. To validate the design, a prototype of the whole SCTA architecture was fabricated and measured. Experimental results have indicated the proposed SCTA exhibits a peak gain of 20.6 dBi at the 30-GHz band and a continuous 2D beam steering range of ±15° with a 1.7-dB average steering loss, which will be very attractive for UAV-based emergency communication applications."

However, there has been limited focus on constructing discrete chaotic maps with complicated dynamics in the complex field.

To illustrate the effectiveness of 1-D-CCM, we construct two 1-D complex-variable chaotic maps by combining inverse trigonometric functions and hyperbolic trigonometric functions. We provide theoretical proof of a new 1-D complex-variable chaotic map as one example to demonstrate that the generated chaotic maps satisfy the chaos definition in terms of Lyapunov exponent. Property analysis reveals distinct strange attractors and hyperchaotic behaviors for the two 1-D complex-variable chaotic maps.

To address these issues, we propose a novel arbitrary-oriented object detection framework based on a Divergence-aware and Ranking cost-based Label Assignment strategy, namely DRLA-Net. Specifically, we design a coarse-to-fine label assignment strategy (DRLA) that models rotated bounding boxes as 2D Gaussian distributions to preserve spatial and directional consistency, while incorporating scale-aware analysis to improve robustness against extreme aspect ratios. To further enhance distributional alignment, we introduce a divergence-aware similarity loss by integrating the Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) with the Generalized Jensen–Shannon Divergence (GJSD), achieving more stable and symmetric optimization. Furthermore, we formulate a unified ranking cost that jointly considers semantic confidence, spatial alignment, and Gaussian similarity, thereby enabling dynamic selection of high-quality positive samples and alleviating the conflict between classification confidence and localization quality. The proposed strategy is applied across the feature pyramid network, which significantly improves the localization of tiny objects with arbitrary shapes and orientations. Extensive experiments on two large-scale rotated object detection datasets, DIOR-R and DOTA-v2.0, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

To eliminate this problem, biometric authentication has been introduced as an alternative solution. Biometric verification is a mechanism through which it confirms a user’s identity using their unique physiological attributes like fingerprints, face identification, voice, etc., that cannot be stolen. Biometric authentication systems store information to verify a user’s identity and verify the original details when a user attempts to access the account. The most used biometric authentication is fingerprint recognition. However, it faces several issues, particularly in detecting spoofed fingerprints created using materials such as latex and gelatin. To address this issue, liveliness detection has emerged as a critical solution to distinguish between real and artificial fingerprints.

Hopefully, this will help you better grasp the classifier's logic. In order to retain clients and produce long-term profitability, particularly in extremely competitive marketplaces, the study shows that client relationship managers need powerful analytical tools. In spite of exhibiting their performance, this investigation demonstrates how collaborative models of learning can be used to strengthen client satisfaction as well as an organization's bottom line."

    "abstract": "Extrinsic regression of time series data consists in predicting the value of a numerical target variable using an input vector which is a time series. The target variable is considered as “extrinsic” as it is not of the same nature as the series values and may not necessarily follow the temporal continuity of the series. This formalization addresses a wide range of problems in different application areas, such as environmental, health or sentiment analysis. In line with the literature on supervised classification of time series, some classification methods have been adapted to the task of regression. Existing regression methods are diverse and use different paradigms, e.g. distance-based methods, interval-based or neural network-based approaches. In parallel to these developments, several libraries for unsupervised feature extraction from time series data have been developed, primarily for descriptive analysis and visualization purposes. In this paper, we combine existing regression methods with signal processing libraries that extract features from time series. To that purpose, the potential of 10 libraries, for the extrinsic regression task, across a set of 61 datasets and six usual regressors is evaluated. The comparative analysis of results from over 3,000 learning ex-periments suggests that unsupervised feature extraction achieves competitive performance for extrinsic regression."

However, their high computational complexity and energy consumption pose significant challenges. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient CNN feature extractor that integrates a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) block with an 8-bit approximate multiplier. The PCA block reduces dimensionality, optimizing computation and preserving essential image features, while the approximate multiplier enhances energy efficiency by reducing power consumption, area, and delay. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms previous works significantly in terms of maximum error distance (MED), mean error distance (MeanED) and power consumption. By using approximate computing techniques, this work contributes to the development of low-power, high-performance architectures suitable for CNN feature extraction in resource-constrained image processing applications."

    "abstract": "In India’s urban and peri-urban regions, greywater (GW) treatment and recycling have become essential strategies to alleviate water constraint. Due to the dense population, little rainfall, and extreme groundwater resource depletion, these areas face significant challenges. Over 50% of short-term water shortages may be avoided by recycling grey water, which includes wastewater from laundry, dishwashers, bathrooms, and kitchens. Effective treatment methods are crucial since the majority of the contaminants in greywater come from domestic activities and detergents. Significant obstacles still exist, nevertheless, in terms of public acceptance and the need for effective purifying techniques. Grey water biological treatment is particularly complex because of the presence of xenobiotics, surfactants, and different pollutant concentrations. Water consumption has grown due to globalization and rapid industrial expansion, making wastewater recycling technology increasingly important. Greywater is simpler to treat using filtering techniques such sand filtration, electrocoagulation (EC), activated carbon, and sediment paper since it has a lower organic content and biological oxygen demand (BOD). After treatment, the water can be safely used again for household gardening, toilet flushing, and agricultural irrigation. Greywater reuse shows promise as a sustainable approach to water management and conservation as the world’s water demand continues to rise and natural resources become more limited."

    "abstract": "Predicting house prices is a crucial challenge in real estate, helping buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions. In this project, we build a neural network to estimate housing prices using the Boston Housing Price dataset. Our approach leverages a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a type of artificial neural network, to learn the complex relationships between various housing features— such as crime rates, property tax, and the number of rooms—and their market value.To ensure accuracy, we preprocess the data using Min-Max Scaling, making it easier for the model to learn meaningful patterns. The MLP consists of multiple layers of neurons with ReLU activation functions, allowing it to capture intricate trends in housing prices. We train the model using backpropagation, optimizing with RMSprop and evaluating performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).The results highlight the potential of deep learning in real estate forecasting, showing how neural networks can provide valuable insights into price estimation. While this project focuses on MLPs, it opens the door to exploring even more advanced techniques, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, to further improve prediction accuracy. By applying AI to housing price prediction, we take a step toward smarter, data-driven decision-making in the real estate industry.By integrating AI into real estate forecasting, we move closer to smarter, more precise property valuation, helping individuals and businesses make better financial decisions based on data-driven insights."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, exploration of the mobile and internet technologies among peoples has increased leveraging online platform and its services through terms of agreement. Online platform and its services were used for data storages, data networking and deployment and usages of software applications over the internet due to its flexibility, accessibility and cost effectiveness. Despite of many advantages, many challenges have exhibited in the online platform and its services due to violation of the terms of agreements. Traditionally, many researchers have designed to identify the violation of the terms of the agreement by online platforms. However those approaches fails detect and classify the evolving practices accurately into non-compliance clauses with respect to the established terms and conditions. In this paper, a new proactive approach is designed using Graph Convolution Network and Long Short Term Model to detect and classifying the evolving practice of the services providers to established terms of agreement to the specified services into noncompliance clauses as compliant, questionable, or potentially unlawful. Primarily model is trained using Terms of Service (ToS) dataset which extract from kaggle repository. Initially dataset pre-processing is performed out using stop word removal, stemming, Tokenization and Token Weighting –Term Frequency. Feature vector in form Word embedding is transformed into graph structured data. Graph structured data represented with node and its edge. In this file and its words from the dataset represents the node and relations between files or its words represent the edge which is obtained using Pearson correlation coefficients. Initially input layer of the graph convolution Network receives the file graph and its file specific words. Further graph convolution layer aggregates features of the neighboring files using degree normalized message passing to ensure balanced influence among nodes. The output layer generates updated node embedding which includes features of files and its aggregated neighbor. Long Short Term Model Network is applied to capture long term dependency of the temporal features of the ToS dataset using gating mechanism along cell state updates and hidden states. Especially dense layer is interfaced to transform the LSTM output into feature vector. The temporal feature embedding from LSTM model and Relational features embedding from GNN were concatenated to form a unified feature vector. Finally dense layer with activation function and softmax function classifies the terms of service file into class labels (compliant, questionable, or potentially unlawful) effectively. Experimental analysis of the model is performed in the Google colab environment incorporating tensorflow libraries and sklearn libraries. On performance analysis, proposed model attains 98.4% of detection accuracy and 98.9% of classification accuracy which were found to be better compared to conventional approaches"

However, current approaches either rely on querying the LLM multiple times, requiring access to its internals, or fine-tuning it. Given the significant operational costs of an LLM, we propose a selective prediction system that does not involve the LLM during inference. We conduct an extensive experimental study regarding training data sizes, time consumption, utilized models, and embeddings, improving on the current state-of-the-art while treating the LLM as a black box, without accessing its internals or requiring fine-tuning."

These patterns, or network motifs, can often be detected algorithmically. However, visual inspection remains vital for exploring and discovering patterns. This paper focuses on presenting motifs within BioFabric network visualizations-a unique technique that opens opportunities for research on scaling to larger networks, design variations, and layout algorithms to better expose motifs. Our goal is to show how highlighting motifs can assist users in identifying and interpreting patterns in BioFabric visualizations. To this end, we leverage existing motif simplification techniques. We replace edges with glyphs representing fundamental motifs such as staircases, cliques, paths, and connector nodes. The results of our controlled experiment and usage scenarios demonstrate that motif simplification for BioFabric is useful for detecting and interpreting network patterns. Our participants were faster and more confident using the simplified view without sacrificing accuracy. The efficacy of our current motif simplification approach depends on which extant layout algorithm is used. We hope our promising findings on user performance will motivate future research on layout algorithms tailored to maximizing motif presentation."

For this purpose, we analyzed the applications of AI, the challenges, training needs, and changes in their role as school counselors. This research is framed within the qualitative methodology through content analysis. For the data collection, an open-ended questionnaire was used with a sample of 20 school counselors from secondary schools. As main results and conclusions, it should be noted that the participants emphasize the help of AI in streamlining bureaucratic tasks in the school context, the personalization in vocational guidance, and the creation of materials to address student diversity, for example, with vulnerable groups. They identify challenges associated with human disconnection, lack of data privacy, and the need for training, essentially from a technical perspective. However, school counselors are still unclear about the changes in their roles and responsibilities derived from AI use. Some of them consider that AI will not entail relevant changes, while others anticipate the need for data interpretation and technological supervision. The findings of this study emphasize the need for further research on the benefits and risks of AI in school counseling for secondary education."

While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other Residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned policies in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer."

The results revealed distinct PFC activation patterns supporting sensory processing, motor planning, and cognitive control to maintain balance under different degraded sensory conditions. Furthermore, by applying machine learning classifiers and multivariate feature selection, the PFC locations and haemodynamic responses indicative of different sensory conditions were identified. The findings of this study offer valuable insights for optimising rehabilitation approaches, enhancing the design of fNIRS studies, and advancing brain-computer interface technologies for balance assessment and training."

    "abstract": "Electronic waste (E-waste) is an escalating global challenge, with discarded laptops forming a major share of this growing environmental burden. To support sustainable consumption and informed consumer decision making, this study proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework that ranks refurbished and new laptop brands based on consumer sentiment extracted from online reviews. The framework identifies not only direct product features called aspects (such as battery, display, or customer support) but also experiential dimensions (such as reliability, performance, or overall satisfaction), providing a holistic view of consumer perception. By leveraging a transformer-based multi-headed attention mechanism and part-of-speech tagging, the model extracts rich five-part sentiment structures: Aspect/Dimension, Category, Opinion, Irrealis (hypotheticals), and Sentiment, collectively represented as ACOIS and DCOIS quintuples. These insights feed into a folksonomy-based consumer brand ranking (CBR) algorithm, which aggregates sentiment scores to rank laptop brands effectively. Unlike traditional models, this framework requires no labeled training data, increasing its adaptability across domains. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrate superior performance with F1 score improvements of 9%, 6%, and 4% in extracting product aspects, dimensions, and opinions, respectively. The model is applied to a curated dataset comprising new and refurbished laptops within the same price segment. Results show that 40% of refurbished brands appear in the top 25% of recommendations. We ensured the framework's robustness check, including McNemar's statistical testing on 6 subtasks (5/6 above 0.05 threshold), ablation studies with 2 alternative attention mechanisms, and validation against 14 benchmark methods, confirming framework's stability."

However, manual evaluation is inherently subjective, and inconsistencies in diagnostic criteria may compromise accuracy. Some existing sperm image classification models are introduced but requiring manual intervention. Most models lack of consideration of alignment between computational classification and WHO sperm morphology standards. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative morphology-aware dual-path reversible network (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">MADRNet</b>) in designing our model. We integrate key biomarkers, such as head aspect ratio and acrosomal integrity, both of which are crucial for clinical sperm assessment, into the network. Particularly, the network utilizes a dual-path attention mechanism, incorporating both parallel spatial and channel attention, while embedding the acrosome anatomical constraint within the channel attention. To further enhance the alignment of our model with the WHO standards, we develop a dynamic loss function considering head aspect ratio constraint. Further, we employ a reversible architecture to enable the model to preserve more microscopic details while reducing GPU memory consumption. Experiments on the HuSHeM dataset demonstrate that the model achieves an accuracy of <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">96.3%</b> and an F1 score of <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">96.8%</b>.

    "abstract": "Tactile feedback is crucial for precise hand manipulation in human-machine interaction, which can improve task performance and enhance user immersion. However, due to the high impedance of the stratum corneum and the spatial variability of tactile sensitivity, how to provide vivid and consistent electrical tactile feedback for the whole hand within a low and safe voltage range remains a challenge. This study developed a flexible and low-voltage electrotactile feedback system to induce precise and personalized tactile sensations. Firstly, to achieve safe tactile stimulation under low-voltage conditions, the system used a high-frequency biphasic square wave modulated by a sine signal to penetrate the skin and stimulate nerves. Secondly, considering the dexterity and complexity of the hand, a high-density flexible electrode patch was designed to fit the hand contour, ensuring stable contact and localized stimulation. Finally, to provide personalized and realistic tactile sensation, the system applied stimulation with tailored parameters to different hand regions based on sensitivity characteristics. Thresholds of four sensation levels were measured in nine participants across different frequencies, with a minimum average detectable voltage as low as 10.7 V. Moreover, virtual tactile sensations associated with grasping objects of different shapes could be simulated, and participants achieved 97.2% accuracy in identifying six fine gestures using tactile cues alone. The system could also be integrated with virtual reality to provide a more immersive experience through dynamic and real-time tactile feedback. These phenomena demonstrated the potential of the proposed tactile system for applications in wearable and interactive systems."

These observations are linked to differences in electron trapping and deceleration dynamics. In particular, for the negative polarity impulse, the trailing edge field predominantly decelerates electrons catching up from behind the pulse, resulting in more effective energy extraction. In contrast, the trailing edge of the positive polarity impulse exhibits predominantly accelerating fields, reducing the efficiency of energy transfer. These polarity-dependent effects are not present in CW sinusoidal amplification, for which the electrons become trapped and reaccelerated within each bunch in saturation."

    "abstract": "Research indicates that R&D volatility is a significant predictor of firm performance. To date, however, answers on how this relationship manifests remain elusive, and practitioners have no clear guidelines for firms' R&D spending strategy. By incorporating the strategic change view into the R&D volatility research, this study proposes a nonlinear framework to revisit the effect of R&D volatility on firm performance. Since the performance implications of a firm's strategic change are determined by the strategic fit between it and internal capability, we also explore the contingency effect of technical capability in terms of firm digitalization and TMT technical experience. Based on a panel sample of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2023, we find that the impact of R&D volatility on firm performance is not simply linear, but follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Moreover, firm digitalization moderates this curvilinear effect in a way that shifts it upward. A bibliometric analysis is conducted to situate our findings within the existing literature, and these research findings provide substantial theoretical and practical implications. In conclusion, our research introduces a nonlinear framework for exploring R&D volatility for the first time."

    "abstract": "Prominent domain discrepancies in Remote Sensing Images (RSIs), such as sensor types, geographical patterns, and land usage, significantly hinder the research and practical applications of cross-scene land classification. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) fully exploits domain invariance between labelled source and unlabelled target domain, which alleviates the challenge of inaccurate land classification due to lack of labels in RSIs. However, most existing UDA methods for RSIs semantic segmentation are insufficient in exploring cross-domain features and have difficulty in modelling fine-grained domain-invariant features between inter-class. In this paper, we propose a novel self-training UDA method named Hierarchical Prototype Learning (HPL), which learns the inherent domain-wise consistency and class-wise invariance through progressive exploration of the prototypy, significantly alleviating the ambiguity in uncertain regions. HPL mainly consists of Domain-wise Progressive Prototype Interaction (DPPI) and Class-wise Dynamic Prototype Collaboration (CDPC). DPPI and CDPC specialize in hierarchically building prototype interaction architectures tailored to domain-wise alignment and class-wise calibration, respectively. This design not only mitigates the sensitivity to cross-domain scenarios but also allows for precise correction of uncertain regions. Furthermore, CDPC exhibits the capacity for pixel-level category restoration and promotes the correct and fine-grained updating of pseudo-labels. Extensive Experiments on two public datasets and a private self-build dataset demonstrate the superiority of HPL over other state-of-the-art methods for UDA semantic segmentation of RSIs."

However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a symbiotic radio (SR) system composed of a multi-antenna radio frequency (RF) source, a backscatter device (BD), and a receiver. SR is an energy- and spectrum-efficient technology with great potential to enable passive Internet of Things (IoT). However, due to the double path loss in the reflecting link, the received BD signal is typically much weaker than the received RF source signal. As the dynamic range (DR) of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver is limited, it is challenging to recover the weak BD signal in the presence of a strong RF source signal after quantization. Additionally, when the low-resolution ADC is employed at the receiver, the introduced quantization noise (QN) will further deteriorate the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system. To mitigate these effects, we adopt optimal quantizers at the receiver and derive a linear quantized signal model, which considers practical modulation schemes and decoding processes. Based on this model, we define the DRs of both the ADC and the received signal, and derive analytical BER expressions for both the BD and RF source signals under the effect of QN. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the BER of the BD signal via transmit beamforming, while accounting for the impact of ADC DR and QN. To solve the fractional optimization problem, we employ Dinkelbach’s algorithm in conjunction with the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming design method and the performance gains achieved by employing optimal quantizers at the receiver."

However, traditional privacy protection techniques often struggle to address privacy leakage resulting from implicit associations within the data. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism based on Cobweb Privacy to safeguard association privacy more comprehensively. Firstly, we design the concept of ϵ-Cobweb Privacy (ϵ-CP) specifically to address association privacy leakage. This concept extends the traditional notion of differential privacy by incorporating associated prior knowledge, thereby offering more effective and comprehensive protection of association privacy. We further demonstrate its privacy guarantees through the theoretical analysis of the relationship between ϵ-CP, differential privacy, and pufferfish privacy. Secondly, we quantify the privacy leakage problem mathematically and examine the utility privacy trade off under various priors. Additionally, we present a universal framework for association privacy protection in data aggregation scenarios using the ϵ-CP mechanism. Finally, this framework is integrated with three different noise addition methods and compared against mechanisms based on differential privacy and pufferfish privacy, and its utility is validated through experiments on both non-temporal and temporal real-world datasets. The results show that ϵ-CP provides distinct advantages in the utility privacy trade-off."

    "abstract": "The rotational inertial navigation systems (RINS) is a type of inertial system designed for high-precision and long-duration navigation tasks. As a core component of inertial navigation systems, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) plays a critical role, and its malfunction can significantly degrade the accuracy of long-duration navigation results due to the cumulative nature of inertial integration. The introduction of the rotary mechanism in RINS enables rotational modulation, which effectively enhances long-term accuracy. However, this rotational modulation also introduces new challenges for IMU fault diagnosis. Therefore, researching IMU fault diagnosis tailored to the characteristics of RINS is of great significance for ensuring the long-term accuracy and reliability of the system. In this paper, a digital-twin-assisted IMU fault diagnosis method is proposed for RINS. Under static conditions, the proposed method achieves an overall fault classification accuracy of 97.99%, representing an average improvement of 28.04% over conventional data-driven approaches. In tests conducted under harsh vehicle conditions, the method attains a fault classification accuracy of 84.27%, which is about 25.08% average higher than that of data-driven methods.

    "abstract": "Many industries, in particular automotive, are undergoing substantial transformations in their underlying electrical and electronic architecture (E/E), pushing for a transition from traditional flat architectures to more decentralized and zonal systems. Moreover, this industry’s demanding constraints and regulations (e.g., ISO26262) limit the application of COTS technologies to support this shift. Seeing this gap, semiconductor designers, like Arm, have been pushing for the Armv8-R processor architecture with specific features to cover the automotive industry’s needs. To address these demands, Arm introduced a dual-stage Memory Protection Unit (MPU) that supports hierarchical memory isolation and enables hypervisor deployment, enhancing its suitability for mixed-criticality real-time environments. In this context, the hypervisor emerges as a solution for consolidating different subsystems onto the same hardware platform, allowing the system to meet SWaP-C (Size, Weight, and Power-Cost) requirements. However, most hypervisor implementations are not designed to run on MMU-less devices. This paper describes the journey of re-designing Bao, an open-source lightweight Static Partitioning Hypervisor (SPH), to the new generation of real-time Arm processors. The core contribution focuses on leveraging the dual-stage MPU and the Armv8-R virtualization extensions to establish a predictable virtualization infrastructure. We evaluated the hypervisor’s performance on a multi-core platform based on the NXP S32Z270 SoC. Bao MMU-less demonstrated high efficiency, with less than 1% performance degradation and only a negligible increase in memory footprint. Additionally, the system exhibited a short boot time of 2.95ms, satisfying a key requirement for real-time systems."

This paper introduces an AI-powered Legal Documentation Assistant that simplifies legal processes through Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The system allows users to generate, comprehend, and personalize legal documents, minimizing the need for legal professionals while maintaining compliance. Automation powered by AI facilitates legal jargon, opening legal procedures to greater accessibility. The article emphasizes advancements in legal automation through AI with examples from Colombia, Finland, and the UK, where AI enhanced contract examination, case handling, and legal investigations. With digitalization of legal documents and utilization of legal text analysis, the system ensures greater efficiency and accuracy in generating documents. Testing reveals that the assistant effectively generates legally binding documents, including contracts and agreements, enhancing ease of use for non-specialists. However, there are issues with periodic misinterpretation of intricate legal terminology, dependence on user input quality, and jurisdictional restrictions. Future development will address increased legal templates, improved AI legal understanding, multilingual support, and optional legal review. Automated compliance checks and real-time advice will further improve accuracy. In spite of its shortcomings, the AI-based assistant represents a major milestone towards legal democratization, cost reduction, and simplification of documentation.

This paper proposes an alternative approach to robotic arm teleoperation using a single two-dimensional RGB camera to recognize hand gestures and estimate body poses. Using the MediaPipe framework, keypoints are extracted in real time, enabling both the recognition of manual gestures for trajectory planning and execution, and the mapping of arm extension to determine movement directions and amplitudes. To validate the approach, the Panda robotic arm was simulated in the Gazebo environment. The operator interacts with the system through an intuitive interface, defining target poses and-based on real-time gesture detection-sending commands to the robot. Results show that execution times are comparable to those achieved with joystick-based teleoperation, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. This study contributes to the advancement of robotics by presenting an accessible and effective solution for robotic system teleoperation."

    "abstract": "The rapid depletion of natural resources has only hastened the necessity to adopt sustainable practices on an industry-wide scale. Of these, recycling stands out as a key but not fully utilized step towards environmental protection and long-term sustainability. Its adoption in India is still limited by infrastructure shortages, lack of public awareness, and lack of incentives. Despite widespread campaigns for waste recycling and segregation, participation, particularly at the industrial and family levels, is erratic and low. This article introduces \"Revolutionizing Recycling,\" a people-driven initiative to bridge these gaps with a blend of behavioral economics, real-world rewards, and digital technology. Drawing on the extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), in which the interplay between attitude, social norms, and perceived control is emphasized, we build a model that utilizes localized engagement, economic rewards, and tech-facilitated openness to transform recycling behavior at scale. At the core of the system is a blockchain-based platform connecting vintage kabadiwalas (informal scrap vendors) with households and businesses in a digitally coordinated waste picking network. The consolidation guarantees each recyclable’s trajectory tracked and incentivized by smart contracts and eco-points—finally exchangeable as government-issued green credits under India’s Green Credit Programme. By integrating trust, traceability, and material rewards, this approach not only incentivizes participation but also encourages green innovation and helps make a positive contribution to protecting the environment. Most importantly, it provides a basis for replicable, technology-enabled circular economy systems that accrue benefits for all—informal waste pickers as much as policymakers."

LiDAR sensors are known for their robustness, making them ideal for autonomous robots, which enable obstacle detection, reliability in adverse lighting conditions, and overall safety assurance. Most 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation networks are fine-tuned for outdoor and urban environments, overlooking other equally important scenes, such as industrial scenarios. In this work, we contribute to an open-source Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pipeline for semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds of indoor warehouse environments. Additionally, we introduce a dataset of simulated industrial point clouds for 3D semantic segmentation called WareSet. We evaluate the quality and viability of our network using well-defined quality metrics, including accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU) per class, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), for both training and validation sets. The experiments were conducted in an unfamiliar warehouse environment, taking into account the proposed dataset and the specified quality metrics. The proposed approach yields satisfactory results of 98.49% and 90.59% for accuracy, and 90.64% and 49.49% for mIoU in training and validation, respectively, with good model convergence. Additionally, it achieves 89.7% accuracy and 50.4% mIoU on the unknown warehouse, emphasizing its generalization capability.

This paper, in particular, presents an innovative method inspired by quantum-like principles of randomness and superposition for image steganography that allows for higher levels of security. The development of user-end web applications based on the Flask framework allows the embedding of secret messages within an image using a form of a quantum-like transformation. Randomized manipulation of bits using Pillow, a library for Python programming, basically makes changes to the pixel highly unpredictable. To this end, the hidden data become increasingly resistant to detection and extraction. Thus, with regard to modern-day steganalysis techniques, the approach developed here will ensure secure and robust image steganography capable of handling confidential data transmission."

    "abstract": "On continuous development of the advanced technologies like artificial intelligences, synthesis video and imaging application is getting popular across the entertainment and education industries to increase visualizing capabilities of the various aspects on different age category of peoples. Especially GenAI popularization has increased the propagation of the synthesis image and video in the social network. Despite of the various advantages of those technologies, it leads to several challenges with respect to the fake videos and images propagation in the social media towards dissemination of the false information to carry out digital harassment. In order to mitigate those challenges, many traditional approaches have been carried out using machine and learning architectures to detect and mitigate the fake images or videos. However those architectures produces better detection accuracy but generalization ability of those models were still lagging in this performance due to increased volume of data streaming in the social media applications. Thus, it becomes mandatory to design a new centralized solution to social network concerns using federated learning model. Federated learning approach uses the deep learning architecture for detection and mitigation of the deep fake content in the social networks. Federated learning acts as decentralized approach which includes multiple users to train the model with hyper parameters. Federated model uses convolution layers of the convolution neural network for feature extractions and canonical correlation analysis for feature aggregation and fully connected layer for feature classification. Initially model training is performed with set of data preprocessing approaches composed of Gaussian filter and augmentation functions. Those preprocessed content is projected to convolution layer for feature extraction. Next, feature vector from each convolution layer is projected to pooling layer composed of canonical correlation analysis for feature aggregation. Finally those aggregated feature is projected in fully connected layer composed of the activation function, softmax function, and loss function. Activation function normalizes the aggregated feature vector and softmax function uses support vector machine classifier to classify the feature into real and fake images. Especially loss function of the model eliminates the over fitting and under fitting issues of the model. Furthermore model regularization is carried out in the federated learning effectively to increase the accuracy of the model. Experimental and performance analysis of the federated learning model is performed using DFDC dataset on python environment. In this analysis, test data is processed using confusion matrix to obtain the performance parameter value to identify model accuracy and efficiency. On evaluation, it is proved that federated learning architectures produces better results compared to state of art approaches identifying the manipulated content in the image or video efficiently."

    "abstract": "The automotive industry faces a significant challenge in balancing passenger comfort with fuel efficiency. Automotive air conditioning (AC) systems, while crucial for driver and passenger well-being, are substantial energy consumers, significantly impacting fuel economy and increasing greenhouse gas emissions [1], [2]. This effect is particularly pronounced in urban driving conditions, where frequent stops and starts necessitate more frequent AC operation [3]. The energy consumed by AC systems represents a considerable portion of a vehicle's overall energy budget, especially in hotter climates and during peak usage periods. This necessitates the development of innovative strategies to minimize AC energy consumption without compromising passenger comfort. This study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates adaptive sampling, machine learning, edge computing, and energy harvesting technologies to create a more energy-efficient automotive AC system. This integrated approach aims to dynamically optimize AC operation based on real-time conditions and predictive models, thereby minimizing energy waste. The framework's effectiveness will be evaluated through a simulation-based analysis across various vehicle classes (low-end, mid-range, luxury, and electric vehicles) under diverse driving conditions over a 24-hour period. The results will demonstrate the potential for substantial energy savings through the synergistic application of these technologies."

    "abstract": "Estimation of roll angle is necessary for precision-guided munitions.Geomagnetic sensors are widely used in roll angle estimation of spinning projectiles, but their accuracy can be compromised by interference from onboard electromagnetic devices. Therefore, a roll angle estimation for spinning projectile based on phase lock loop with geomagnetic sensor and gyroscope has been proposed. The roll angle data obtained by the gyroscope data in a slide time window(with width≥100) is used to generate cosine and sine sequences, which are respectively correlation integrated with the magnetic sensor data sequences within the same time window. The two integration results are subjected to four-quadrant arc tangent operation to obtain the phase difference between the gyroscope and the geomagnetic sensor, and then the roll angle of the projectile is obtained by Kalman filtering. In order to verify the roll angle estimation method, a semi-physical experiment was carried out, and the experimental results show that expectation of roll angle error of RAEPLL is 0.139 degree and the standard deviation is 0.512 degree while the two error characteristics of ESKF are 0.268 deg and 0.689 deg, indicatingthe method proposed in this paper can get higher roll angle estimation accuracy only using single-axis geomagnetic sensors and gyroscope comparing with the existing roll angle estimation algorithms."

An initial prototype validates the design’s feasibility, demonstrating competitive positioning accuracy and backdrivability comparable to commercial harmonic reducers, despite operating at a significantly lower reduction ratio.

    "abstract": "Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions."

This article proposes a nonlinear automatic matching system for TWTAs through the design of dedicated hardware and software. The system is designed to achieve the automatic tuning of traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) and linearizers at different temperatures, thereby improving the tuning efficiency of devices and the consistency of their performance.

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has emerged as a prominent approach in melanoma treatment, however a substantial number of patients do not respond effectively. This highlights the critical need to accurately predict immunotherapy responses for designing personalised treatment strategies. Current practices rely predominantly on clinical data and the expertise of oncologists; however, a deeper understanding of molecular interactions through tissue-based biomarkers offers a promising avenue for advancement. Whole-slide multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images enable detailed analysis of cells/tissues in their microenvironment, deepening insights into disease mechanisms. However, numerous channels, an extensive image size, and spatially dispersed information of mIF images pose analytical challenges, requiring advanced techniques to effectively learn these intricate features for optimal performance. In this study, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework, Channel Optimisation with Multi-Instance Learning (COMIL), specifically designed to classify whole-slide mIF images for predicting immunotherapy response in melanoma patients. The study demonstrates that a feature extraction method that models inter-channel relationships and captures complex interdependencies among multiple channels of mIF images enhances classification performance. Additionally, incorporating this method within an MIL framework, optimised at both the slide and instance levels, further improves the classification performance of whole-slide mIF images. We evaluated COMIL on mIF images from the Melanoma Institute Australia, where it outperformed baseline methods with substantial improvements on both the internal (AUC increase by 28%) and external test sets (AUC increase by 20%), underscoring its potential for predicting immunotherapy response."

It is a significant indicator for assessing thromboembolic risk. However, current SEC identification requires extensive manual intervention, leading to low accuracy, high costs, and subjectivity. To address these issues, we propose TEENet, an effective clinical detection network for identifying SEC in TEE videos. Specifically, TEENet first generates attention maps for the input clips to highlight important regions and integrates Convolutional Neural Network with the Multi-Head Self-Attention to capture spatiotemporal representations. Furthermore, to enhance the classification performance across different SEC severity grades, we introduce an auxiliary classification module, which simultaneously utilizes the main classification head and auxiliary classification heads. Notably, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 1106 TEE videos collected during clinical examinations performed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from 2018 to 2023, providing a solid foundation for the development and validation of TEENet. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed network achieves the highest SEC identification accuracy of 92.4<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>1.3% compared to other spatiotemporal representation networks such as SlowFastR50 (89.6<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.7%) and TimeSformer (74.9<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>1.8%), which shows strong potential for effective auxiliary diagnosis in clinical practice."

To address the formulated non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm which employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve the decomposed subproblems. The simulation results demonstrate distinct advantages over benchmarks achieved by combining ARIS and the ISWPT system."

In this regard, smart walkers (i.e., traditional walkers augmented with sensors and intelligent systems) emerge as a promising solution for gait monitoring and locomotion assistance. Human-robot interaction is a fundamental area in smart walker development and, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is an opportunity to enable more natural and adaptive channels of communication for context-aware interaction. In this work, we propose an intelligent system for assisted navigation in smart walkers that integrates an LLM-based multi-agent with ROS 2 to dynamically set interaction modes. The system has three stages: command detection, operating mode definition, and secondary mode selection. To validate the proposed solution, two datasets were created: one with textual commands and another with voice commands transcribed using Whisper. The results demonstrate promising performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values above 86 percent in all stages for both scenarios. The observed results pave the way for practical implementations on the robot itself and for validation on realistic scenarios."

This has applications in creating models based on federated learning, the Internet of Things and Digital Twins. This paper proposes a new neural network model that uses the atrous technique and attention modules. In addition, we propose a hierarchical-based training strategy, where the best model shares weights and is omitted during further training. This reduces the number of training epochs and increases the model's adaptability to a given set. The tests conducted on a publicly available medical database indicate high learning potential for both the proposed model and the hierarchical learning strategy."

Cryptographic algorithms are employed as a key solution to ensure integrity and privacy of the communicated data across the network. Due to the fast expansion of IoT devices across several applications like smart homes, healthcare sector and other industrial systems, ensuring protection is a significant part while reducing computing overhead. The Lightweight Encryption Algorithm provides an in-depth evaluation in solving security issues highlighting its applicability over Internet of Things. The proposed research on light weight cryptographic algorithm plays a crucial role on addressing major difficulties to ensure data privacy and distribution. The proposed cryptography algorithm proves to be superior in effectiveness and versatility when compared to several other encryption techniques with limited resources. The conventional cryptographic methods utilized by LEA performed weaker in side-channel attack vulnerabilities, key recovery approaches & limited cryptography resistance. To overcome these issues with new LEA's design, the research suggests hardware-oriented techniques such as pipelining & parallel processing, better key scheduling & the integration of S-boxes will enhance non-linearity as an alternative approach. Based on VHDL-based simulations, the research validates these improvements by measuring resource usage, system performance & cryptographic strength using programs like Intel® Quartus® Prime and Model Sim. The results obtained demonstrate that LEA is appropriate for deployment in a range of IoT applications & offers significant benefits in terms of security & operational efficiency."

In order to do so, the developed platform needs information about the AC bus voltage, the wind and water speed, the irradiation, the initial state-of-charge of battery, as well as the simulation time to verify if maximum and minimum limits of SOC are reached. The validation of the detailed modeling of microgrid components and the energy management logic through simulations allows to consider this computational tool as an opportunity to facilitate the specification of components, and verify the technical viability of this kind of project.

In order to precisely identify and categorize tomato leaves in the field, this study proposes a target detection model utilizing the enhanced YOLOv7.To enhance the capability of the method's feature extraction, we initially introduce the detection process SimAM and DAiAM into the design structure of the baseline network YOLOv7. To minimize the loss of information when carrying out down sampling, the max-pooling convolution (MPConv) architecture is then enhanced. Then, these points are passed on to anExplicit Feature Interaction-Aware Graph Neural Network (EFIGNN) classifier, which has an accuracy of 98.8% and an error rate of 1.2%. Lastly, we compare our research with existing work in order to demonstrate how valuable the proposed work is and give support to the idea."

    "abstract": "The introduction of robotics into agriculture presents significant scope for improving efficiency and coping with labor shortages. High accuracy for complex tasks such as robotic tomato picking, however, requires advanced perception and accurate pose estimation—capabilities that conventional 2D detection methods fundamentally lack. This paper introduces a new pipeline using DUSt3R, a transformer-based method, for dense 3D reconstruction and 6D pose estimation of tomato clusters. Unlike traditional vision systems, our method utilises RGB-D imagery from an Intel RealSense D435i to generate dense point clouds and estimate interview poses, eliminating the need for explicit calibration, thereby making it resilient to calibration drift in dynamic farm conditions. To further enhance surface continuity, especially in fine-grained areas such as stems and calyx, we apply Gaussian Splatting as a refinement step, resulting in cleaner, more complete geometric models. The approach proves robust to real-world challenges such as heavy occlusions, non-uniform lighting, and closely packed tomato arrangements. Experimental evaluations across a wide range of tomato clusters demonstrate a 71 percent reduction in orientation error, a 72 percent drop in position error, and an improvement in cutting success rates from 72 percent to 91 percent compared to a state-of-the-art 2D detection pipeline. These results underscore the value of dense 3D understanding and calibration-free processing for reliable and scalable robotic harvesting in diverse agricultural environments."

    "abstract": "One of the promising recent advances in medical imaging is indeed the successful exploration of GANs for applications such as image super-resolution and text enhancement. Most GAN-based approaches, however, have been driven for a single modality: enhancing the quality of images or text clarity-while simultaneously eliciting little attention towards the two interrelated aspects. A new dual GAN framework is therefore proposed to overcome this limitation by combining the merits of both Image Super Resolution GAN and Text Enhancement GAN. In this merged approach, both the resolution of images and the adequacy of the textual annotation improved to enhance diagnostic accuracy as well as improve the visualization of small lesions and tissue structures in medical images. The system works on the principle of cross-domain benefit sharing; enhancement in either quality, the image, or the text, naturally boosts the quality of the other. The performance of the proposed dual GAN system is measured through some key metrics, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) accuracy to provide clear evidence of significant improvement in both image and text qualities as compared with other conventional methods. This innovation improves the process of clinical decision-making in the sense that clearer images and text are more accurate. The approach has tremendous potential for much wider practical applications: document scanning, surveillance, astronomy, and microscopy-all applications where textual and visual clarity are important for precision and analysis."

    "abstract": "Graph processing is a computation model employed to wide range of cloud based application while graph partitioning is significant towards optimizing cost and its performance towards processing task in the large scale geo distributed data centers. Recently, Cloud based application distributes their user data to geo distributed data centers for efficient access and sharing among interested user on employing graph partitioning approaches which as low latency. However heterogeneity of those data to the cloud has become challenging task to classify and share those data among user. In this paper, a graph processing approach using deep learning method named as multiattention graph convolution network is designed to classify and distribute cloud data among various users easily. Initially user data composed of multiple attribute is transformed into graph structured data. Graph structured data represented with node and its edge. In graph structure, user represents the node and related attribute relations of the user represent the edge which is obtained using Pearson correlation coefficients. Initially input layer of the graph convolution Network receives the user graph and its user specific attributes. Further graph convolution layer aggregates information of the neighboring user using degree normalized message passing to ensure balanced influence among users on minimizing sum of square distances to its least square fit. The graph pooling layer generates updated node embedding which includes user features and its neighbor information’s on reducing moment of inertia of the node. Finally dense layer with activation function for partition refined heuristics and soft max function classifies the integer features of user into multiple class partitions to organize data in the distributed data center as mixed integer quadratic optimization. Experimental analysis of the model is performed using EHR Dataset on python environment incorporating tensor flow to obtain GPU capabilities. On performance analysis, proposed model attains 98.4% partitioning accuracy which found to be better compared to conventional graph processing approaches"

    "abstract": "The aging process of lithium-ion batteries has a significant impact on their safety performance. However, the quantitative relationship between aging parameters and overcharge-induced thermal runaway behavior requires further investigation. This study systematically quantified key aging parameters, including capacity fade, anode voltage loss, SEI film resistance increase, and charging temperature rise, to develop a multiphysics-coupled overcharge thermal runaway model incorporating aging effects. The results demonstrate that battery aging markedly reduces overcharge tolerance, as evidenced by an exponential decrease in the thermal runaway triggering SOC threshold with the degree of aging. Furthermore, the charging rate shows a significant negative correlation with overcharge resistance (each 1C rate increase reduces the SOC threshold by approximately 12%), while both the thermal runaway onset temperature and the electrolyte reference oxidation potential exhibit positive correlations (each 0.1V increase in oxidation potential expands the safety window by 5.6%).This research provides important theoretical foundations for understanding the thermal runaway mechanisms in aged batteries and enhancing the safety of power batteries throughout their lifecycle."

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical attributes, and applying oversampling to balance class distribution.Six classification techniques were employed: logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and naive Bayes. Performance evaluation considered accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among these, random forest achieved the highest accuracy (99%), followed by decision tree (98.94%) and naive Bayes (97.89%), whereas support vector machine exhibited the lowest (65.26%).

In dynamic situations, traditional rule-based systems find it difficult to adapt, but the suggested approach makes it possible to acquire optimal driving techniques via interaction with the environment. Simulation-based data collection, preprocessing sensor data, DQN training using target networks and experience replay, and real-time policy implementation are all components of the technique. Integrated to integrated state representations are sensor inputs including cameras, LiDAR, GPS, along with collision detectors. Outperforming both conventional systems and similar RL approaches such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), experimental findings demonstrate the accuracy level up to 95% in controlled situations and 55% in unexpected contexts. Although performance drops in dynamic environments, the system is resilient in the face of changing weather and traffic circumstances. Future research will concentrate on enhancing generalization and implementing DQN in the real world, but these results demonstrate its efficacy for flexible, scalable autonomous navigation."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth in global internet consumption has increased the complexity of wireless networks, making network traffic analysis and optimization more challenging. Efficient resource management across all network layers is essential to maintaining service quality and meeting increasing demand. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and high-dimensional nature of modern networks. In contrast, machine learning techniques enable automated network traffic analysis, real-time pattern detection, and predictive modeling, offering a more effective approach to network management. This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques for network traffic analysis using data captured from a local network router. Three approaches were implemented: clustering, anomaly detection, and classification. The clustering analysis categorized traffic into four main clusters based on protocol type and packet size, providing a detailed view of network usage patterns. The anomaly detection model identified that most anomalies shared a common destination port, offering insights into unusual or potentially malicious traffic. Additionally, the classification model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting packet transmission protocols, enabling automatic protocol identification even when metadata is incomplete. The findings underscore the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance network monitoring, optimize traffic management, and improve decision-making for network administrators."

Many plant diseases share visual similarities, making manual inspection both time consuming and error prone, which is why robust and adaptable disease detection frameworks are not only desirable but essential to maintaining a resilient agricultural ecosystem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid federated learning (FL) framework that integrates a globally shared feature extractor with a client-specific self-attentive branch and classifier. The proposed framework uses a global model with both globally shared and client-tailored branches to achieve better performance for specialized tasks in decentralized training scenarios. The experiments were carried out on a Plant Village data set in a scenario, where each client represented a different crop type and faced a different leaf disease classification problem. The proposed solution revolved around the clients sharing the global weights, thus simultaneously contributing towards better feature extraction of the common leaf features, while the specialized segment of the model focused on proper interpretation of the extracted features (via cross-attention mechanism) and direct classification. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over standard local training, as training with the proposed hybrid FL framework resulted in a perfect classification of the precision 100% of apple leaf disease."

To cope with this diversity, we propose a graphical notation, PV*, that precisely describes the coupling relationships between multiple viewpoints on physical or virtual views, as well as their control by collaborators. We study the descriptive power of PV* by describing several collaborative situations from the literature and discuss its generative power by exploring several design possibilities described with PV*."

    "abstract": "Robot simulators are indispensable tools across many fields, and recent research has significantly improved their functionality by incorporating additional gradient information. However, existing differentiable robot simulators suffer from non-differentiable singularities, when robots undergo substantial shape changes. To address this, we present the Shape-Differentiable Robot Simulator (SDRS), designed to be differentiable under significant robot shape changes. The core innovation of SDRS lies in its representation of robot shapes using a set of convex polyhedrons. This approach allows us to generalize smooth, penalty-based contact mechanics for interactions between any pair of convex polyhedrons. Using the separating hyperplane theorem, SDRS introduces a separating plane for each pair of contacting convex polyhedrons. This separating plane functions as a zero-mass auxiliary entity, with its state determined by the principle of least action. This setup ensures global differentiability, even as robot shapes undergo significant geometric and topological changes. To demonstrate the practical value of SDRS, we provide examples of robot co-design scenarios, where both robot shapes and control movements are optimized simultaneously."

    "abstract": "Considering the importance of green and secure communications in the complex environments of the future Internet of Things (IoT), a secure wireless powered communication network (WPCN) assisted by double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated. To maximize the system’s secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), we propose a Lagrange dual decomposition combined with double quadratic transformation and Riemannian manifold optimization (LDD-DQT-RMO) algorithm to jointly optimize the resource allocation, transmit and receive beamforming, and phase shifts at RISs. In particular, the DQT-RMO method is employed for the first time to optimize the phase shifts in the wireless information transmission (WIT) phase. Furthermore, an improved low-complexity algorithm is developed to directly obtain closed-form solutions for the phase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LDD-DQT-RMO and its improved algorithm achieve much lower complexity and faster convergence compared to mainstream algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithms exhibit superior SEE performance compared to hybrid double-RIS-assisted WPCN systems in multi-antenna and large-scale RIS scenarios."

    "abstract": "This paper elaborates on an extensive security framework specifically designed for energy management systems (EMSs), which effectively tackles the dynamic environment of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or system problems (SPs), accomplished through the incorporation of novel methodologies. A comprehensive multi-point attack/error model is initially proposed to systematically identify vulnerabilities throughout the entire EMS data processing pipeline, including post state estimation (SE) stealth attacks, EMS database manipulation, and human-machine interface (HMI) display corruption according to the real-time database (RTDB) storage. This framework acknowledges the interconnected nature of modern attack vectors, which utilize various phases of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data flow. Then, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs) for EMSs are proposed for the first time in the power system domain to handle the scenarios. Further, a set-of-mark generative intelligence (SoM-GI) framework, which leverages multimodal analysis by integrating visual markers with rules considering the GenAI capabilities, is suggested to overcome inherent spatial reasoning limitations. The SoM-GI methodology employs systematic visual indicators to enable accurate interpretation of segmented HMI displays and detect visual anomalies that numerical methods fail to identify. Validation on the IEEE 14-Bus system shows the framework’s effectiveness across scenarios, while visual analysis identifies inconsistencies. This integrated approach combines numerical analysis with visual pattern recognition and linguistic rules to protect against cyber threats and system errors."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems enable the continuous monitoring and collection of healthcare data from various medical devices and sensors, facilitating real-time analysis and timely interventions. One such example of the IoMT system is the early and accurate detection of arrhythmia using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which plays a crucial role in improving patient health. However, healthcare data contains sensitive information that raises privacy concerns for users. In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training on distributed ECG data at the device level while preserving data privacy. However, FL is computationally expensive and suffers from data heterogeneity, which slower convergence, reduces performance, and hinders generalization across diverse client datasets. In this work, we propose a lightweight FL-based model designed explicitly for arrhythmia detection with data heterogeneity. We evaluate our model's performance on two publicly available ECG datasets (PTBD and MIT-BIH arrhythmia). The proposed model achieves high accuracy (between 0.95 and 0.98) while maintaining robustness against heterogeneous data distributions. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate significant efficiency gains compared to a baseline model (ResNet). Our proposed lightweight FL-based model requires substantially less mega floating point operations (MFLOPS) (0.07 vs. 2.14 for ResNet) and communication cost (1000 Mb vs. 7500 Mb for ResNet) to achieve convergence. These results indicate the potential of our proposed approach for practical and privacy-preserving arrhythmia detection in resource-constrained IoMT settings."

The entire geometry is then translated into a sequence of unit blocks, and a hierarchical tree of cascading operations is built. Full solutions are obtained by combining smaller blocks into larger blocks. For the blocks that repeat in the cascading process, the matrix is computed only once and can be reused later. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method with over 70% time cost reduction and decreased memory usage than conventional HCT.

    "abstract": "While spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in neuromorphic computing by emulating biological neuronal dynamics, their learning capabilities remain constrained by predominant focus on synaptic plasticity. This limitation overlooks critical neurobiological evidence showing that intrinsic neuronal plasticity, particularly dynamic threshold adaptation, plays an essential role in balancing neural responsiveness and signal fidelity. Inspired by two neurophysiological principles governing threshold regulation: 1) the inverse correlation between spiking thresholds and preceding depolarization rates, and 2) the proportional relationship between thresholds and average membrane potentials, we propose a Membrane Potential-Driven Adaptive Threshold Plasticity (MPD-ATP) framework. This biologically grounded mechanism establishes a dual-pathway control system where instantaneous depolarization rates and sustained membrane potential states jointly modulate neuronal thresholds through an adaptive scaling factor. The instantaneous depolarization rate dynamically lowers thresholds during strong input bursts, while the sustained average membrane potential adjusts the baseline threshold to stabilize firing during sparse input. This complementary regulation improves precision and robustness. Extensive evaluations on static (CIFAR-10/100) and neuromorphic (CIFAR10-DVS, DVSGesture) benchmarks demonstrate that MPD-ATP-enhanced networks achieve superior classification accuracy with enhanced noise robustness. Systematic ablation studies reveal that the coordinated interaction between depolarization-sensitive and membrane potential-proportional threshold adjustments is critical for preventing signal saturation in high-activity networks while mitigating under-activation in sparse-input scenarios."

This paper proposes a data-driven approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that processes orbit estimation residual sequences to automatically identify maneuvers without requiring threshold selection or predefined models. First, systematic feature engineering identifies a compact 7-dimensional statistical representation based on detection statistics that reduces input dimensionality by 79% while maintaining detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency for real-time deployment. Second, a track-aware temporal loss function is developed incorporating class balance weights, exponential delay penalties, and track-level detection suppression to address the extreme class imbalance and temporal bias introduced by temporal labeling. Third, comprehensive evaluations across diverse scenarios with maneuver magnitudes of 1.5, 3, and 5 m/s and realistic observation gaps demonstrate that while traditional threshold-based methods face inherent trade-offs between detection and false alarm rates, the proposed specialized loss function effectively breaks this limitation by reducing false alarms by 42.6% and detection delays by 53.2% compared to standard cross-entropy training. Finally, experimental results demonstrate superior performance with 89.64% detection rate at 5.34% false alarm rate and 0.73 frame mean detection delay, significantly outperforming traditional threshold-based detection (83.6% detection rate) and recent LSTM methods, validating the effectiveness of track-aware temporal modeling for real-time spacecraft maneuver detection."

This paper explores advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued to human drivers, thus achieving near-term performance of automated vehicles. Due to the complexity of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have leveraged deep reinforcement learning (RL). Coarse-grained advisory is formalized as zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold durations from 0.1 to 40 seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher-frequency tasks for CAVs, a direct application of deep RL fails to generalize to advisory autonomy tasks. To overcome this, we employ zero-shot transfer, training policies on a set of source tasks-specific traffic scenarios with designated hold durations-and then evaluating the efficacy of these policies on different target tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select source tasks for zero-shot transfer, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for energy storage in residential photovoltaic systems highlights the potential of second-life electric vehicle batteries. Their residual capacity offers economic and environmental benefits. However, their cells suffer from a significant capacity mismatch, which reduces the overall usable capacity of the battery. Dynamic equalization appears to be a promising solution to fully exploit the battery capacity. This work aims to present a simulation platform designed to evaluate the benefits of dynamic equalization in second-life batteries used for residential photovoltaic energy storage. Through the simulation platform, various scenarios were simulated based on real production and consumption data collected over a one-year operating period to account for seasonal variations. Simple control algorithms are investigated and compared with an improved one based on a digital twin of the battery. In addition, the effects of the equalization system efficiency, battery size, and cell capacity mismatch on the dynamic equalization behavior are discussed. This study demonstrates that the use of dynamic equalization increases energy utilization by up to 8%, even when the efficiency of the equalization DC-DC converter is as low as 70%. Finally, an economic analysis is performed to compare brand-new lithium-ion batteries and second-life batteries with and without dynamic equalization."

    "abstract": "Humans possess seven types of intelligence for learning. However, conventional educational systems mostly rely only on the Linguistic and Mathematical types. This narrow focus leaves other intelligences unrecognized and unutilized in learners’ learning processes. The main challenge lies in holistically addressing diverse intelligence levels in typical educational settings. Prior research isolated dominant intelligence traits for personalization, which lack objectivity and fail to utilize the full spectrum of learning potentials. The goal of this research is to identify and predict underlying learning patterns in university students, enabling addressing all types of intelligence holistically at the group level. To achieve this, a multi-algorithm framework integrating unsupervised and supervised learning is developed to analyze Multiple Intelligences profiles and associated learner parameters from the Learning Meta-Learning dataset. MI profiles capture all seven types of intelligences. K-Means clustering identified three unique and interpretable MI profile patterns, outperforming the Two-Step clustering algorithm. For prediction, CatBoost achieved 92.20% accuracy across seven algorithms, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and HistGradientBoosting. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence through Shapley Additive Explanations and optimizing features, its accuracy improved to 93.66%. The identified Multiple Intelligences profile patterns offer actionable insights. Beyond the high-level guidelines for personalizing instruction outlined in this paper, they can inform various personalized educational approaches and support further research by providing a structured understanding of learner diversity and a predictive framework."

However, current designs are limited in augmenting explosive locomotion and reducing dependence on external energy sources. Given these challenges, we proposed a body-powered lower extremity exoskeleton employing clutched parallel elastic magnetorheological actuators (CPEMAs). The CPEMA on the knee joint primarily comprises a high-stiffness torsional spring to recycle the human body’s kinetic energy, three high-torque magnetorheological fluid bearings functioning as clutches, and a gear reducer for torque amplification. When the torsional springs are engaged, the CPEMAs accumulate energy from the knee’s periodic flexion and extension with low power consumption. Then, the stored energy can be released in one burst for explosive actuation. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed exoskeleton, including enhancements of around 53% in kicking force, 31% in lower extremity strength, and 12% in jumping ability. The system advances the understanding of exoskeleton-assisted high-performance locomotion, showcasing a substantial potential to transcend the human body’s limitations."

The novel contribution of this paper is to provide a closed-form mathematical solution to calculate individual phase currents from the total flux density, given the pole configuration of the distribution feeder.

The session focused on the themes history, impact, lessons learned, and barriers to the adoption of MDD. In the context of history and impact, amongst others, the results of the Norwegian national R&D project “Supporting Integrated System Development” (SISU) were discussed, as well as recent development approaches akin to MDD. The panelists agreed that the quality of the systems produced within SISU was usually very high, since the used modeling concepts match reality well and made the models therefore easier to comprehend. Nevertheless, the adoption of SDL in the member companies did not progress as expected after project completion. This makes SISU a typical example of the circumstance that MDD has not developed as successfully as was assumed 30 years ago. The discussion of the panelists on barriers to MDD revealed key challenges in two perspectives: users' experience and tools' support. Besides some lessons learned, this paper presents a number of recommendations that might help to address the mentioned challenges leading towards a more prominent use of MDD in software engineering in the future."

Identification of relevant SRIs for an application needs domain experts to analyze the information obtained from indices. Existing studies have used SRIs in a limited way - 1) as a single value for a location (county) and thus suffer from loss of spatial information; 2) only few popular spectral indices e.g. NDVI, SAVI, NDWI, etc. are exploited; 3) have been used for applications like crop yield and snow cover prediction. To circumvent these limitations, we embarked on three novel ideas - 1) compute spectral indices at pixel level of the satellite image resulting in an SRI image for a region; 2) introduce a selection method which selects SRIs relevant to a given application; 3) design a model called Spectral Indices Network, SpInN, utilizing two transformers ViViT and BERT. We use ViViT innovatively on different SRI images treating them as video frames for spatio-spectral index learning. We also use BERT to exploit temporal patterns of the spectral index time series. The proposed model is applied to various prediction and classification earth observation applications such as prediction of crop yield, solar energy, soil moisture, land cover classification, etc., and obtained state-of-the-art results."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of emerging technologies is reshaping the structure and dynamics of labor markets, with significant implications for developing economies. In response, higher education institutions face the strategic imperative of aligning academic programs with the evolving demands of a technology-oriented workforce. This study employs a strategic foresight methodology to explore future curricular scenarios for Peruvian universities toward 2035. A mixed-methods design was implemented, combining quantitative trend analysis with qualitative expert input via a Delphi process. Thirty-three key drivers were identified and assessed based on their importance and uncertainty, leading to a structural classification and scenario development using the Schwartz matrix. Three internally coherent scenarios were constructed, from which one was selected as the normative target. A backcasting approach was applied to define milestones and strategic actions required to achieve this scenario. The findings highlight the need for enhanced coordination among universities, industry, and government to redesign curricula, integrate digital skills, and improve feedback mechanisms. The framework offers practical guidance for academic planners and policymakers seeking to strengthen institutional responsiveness and workforce alignment in the context of ongoing technological disruption."

    "abstract": "This work presents a study of the internal flow in various elliptic vortex grippers designed to generate an air vortex, applying the operating principle of conventional vortex grippers but adapted to non-circular shapes. The study and design focus on a specific application in the counting and packaging process of folded polyethylene bags, with the aim of improving production efficiency without compromising the integrity of the packages or the bags and reducing count errors. Initially, a simplified vortex flow model proposed by a previous author is used to determine the basic circular geometry of the nozzle. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are then employed to investigate how the pressure distribution changes in the elliptic nozzles, which maintain the same area as the initial circular nozzle. This is done by varying the ratio between the major and minor diameters, and adjusting the position of the air inlet, to identify the most efficient configuration in terms of achieving the lowest pressure and optimizing the pressure drop distribution along the major axis. The results guide the design towards an efficient and adaptable solution tailored to the specific requirements of vacuum gripping applications."

As the need for such systems increases, their design and implementation must be made easier and less complex so that third-party IPs can easily be integrated into a multi-die platform such as the example presented in this paper. A templated FPGA-chiplet system to facilitate ease of entry into the chiplet ecosystem is described, where key chiplet infrastructure IPs are detailed–such as die-to-die protocols, die-to-die PHYs, communication peripherals, and a chiplet security engine. We highlight challenges related to the implementation and testing of the platform, which include constraints posed by micro-bumps, chiplet alignment, package and platform considerations, and security threats. The resulting platform frees the chiplet developer from infrastructure design tasks requiring engineer-years of effort and instead can focus on their own compelling IP."

FDA’s Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base supplied a drug dataset of 1042 drugs, and later, after pre-processing and API data extraction, each drug was defined by 16 chemical features such as molecular descriptors and pharmacokinetic properties. To improve uniformity and get quality input for training, data preparation involved correcting missing values, encoding categorical values, and normalising numerical data. Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated to forecast the levels of DILI severity, i.e., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The importance of features was approximated for identifying the predictors that impacted the most. The best overall performance was recorded for XGBoost, and it had 81% accuracy when it was evaluated. Its acceptable discrimination was established for mild, moderate, and severe cases. The aptness of being applied to the medical sector is demonstrated by drastically lowering the principal misclassifications, especially from mild to severe. The application of machine learning in improving medicine safety assessment and reducing risks associated with pharmaceutical development is illustrated here."

First, the NCS color system standardizes and extracts color elements from Shanxi’s ancient architecture to form color samples. These samples are then mapped to selected cultural affective imagery to establish a forward kansei engineering design model for conceptual design. Finally, a reverse kansei engineering evaluation model is established using fuzzy logic combined with grey relational analysis to derive the optimal color scheme, validating the model’s feasibility. This process successfully extracts color elements from Shanxi’s ancient architecture and constructs standardized color samples. A correlation model linking color to sensory imagery was developed for design evaluation and validation. This process ultimately selected a rail transit vehicle color scheme that embodies regional culture while meeting user sensory needs. This research provides an innovative theoretical framework and practical guidance for rail transit vehicle color design, validating the method’s effectiveness and utility in cultural translation expression and design evaluation."

    "abstract": "Phishing attack is becoming an important persistent threat in cyber security as it captures the sensitive information of the victims through establishing fraudulent website and website link. Trojan horse phishing attack is evolving and dynamically changing malicious website or software with attack characteristics. It is highly complex to detect and classify it as disguised as legitimate website or software. Those attack were launched by sending phishing email, email attachments containing fake software updates and websites links to gain access to sensitive information’s and to establish botnet through infected devices. Traditionally many researches have been performed defense and prevention mechanism to phishing attacks using natural language processing methods and machine learning methods to analyze, detect, classify and predict the unusual behavior of the website and software launched through emails. Despite of several advantages those models fail to prevent, detect and classify the evolving and dynamically changing attack characteristics through launching sources. In this paper, a new combined approach is designed using multiattention graph convolution network to prevent, detect and classify the evolving dynamic phishing attacks on analyzing webpages extracted from kaggle repository. Initially, Graph is constructed to process the webpage and its elements. Graph can represents multiple elements like URL, HTML elements. Each node in graph represents specific element such as URL component, HTML tag. Further each node has associated features such as URL characteristics and HTML attributes. Thus edge represents relationship among those elements using similarity computations, proximity computation and other criteria’s. Next, those graph structured data were projected to multiattention graph convolution network which includes attention mechanism and graph convolution network for data processing. Especially graph convolution layer extract the local and global features from the URL and HTML elements using different kernel function. Extracted feature is processed using multi attention mechanism as it is capable of assigning different weights to the local and global features. Finally Fully connected layer aggregates local and global weighted features based on relationship with neighboring nodes features and transform those features into unified attention map on mentioning network attack patterns and normal patterns along its characteristics through activation function. Further softmax function of the fully connected layer generates different strategies for prevention, detection and classification using random forest classifier on processing attention map. Random forest classifier performs attack detection and classification and those classified attack attributes implements weight matrix to compute the volume of attack. On rise in volume of attack, specified URL or program were blocked as mitigation or prevention strategies. Experimental analysis and performance analysis of the multiattention graph convolution network were performed towards Trojan phishing attack prevention, detection and attack prevention or mitigation and it is compared against conventional approaches on processing Phishing dataset on python environment. On its analysis, it is confirmed that proposed model achieves increased detection accuracy of 98.8% on determining the evolving phishing attack with high robustness while compared with traditional approaches."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in reasoning capability and accessibility, driving their deployment across diverse applications. Yet this progress has also widened the surface for safety and security vulnerabilities. Adversaries can exploit prompt diversity, dialog memory, or multimodal inputs to induce unsafe or confidential outputs, while continual fine-tuning and third-party integration render static assurance infeasible. This paper introduces our ongoing national R&D project on developing the AutoPT Framework-an Autonomous Purple Teaming architecture that extends the collaborative principles of purple teaming toward self-adaptive, continuously verifiable LLM assurance. AutoPT unifies autonomous adversarial exploration and adaptive defensive reinforcement through two co-evolving agents. The red module, AutoPT-Red, employs coverage-guided fuzzing and internal measurement metrics to autonomously uncover vulnerabilities. The blue module, AutoPT-Blue, performs self-healing adaptation by updating guardrails and detecting integrity or confidentiality violations using embedding-based feedback. Preliminary case studies on jailbreak fuzzing and backdoor-poisoning defense validate the feasibility of this closed-loop, self-adapting architecture. As part of a broader national initiative, this work lays the conceptual and technical foundation for transitioning industrial purple teaming into a fully autonomous, scalable, and measurable assurance paradigm for generative AI systems."

    "abstract": "Understanding the predictions of time series classifiers is essential in high-stakes domains such as health-care, finance, and security. Counterfactual explanations, which identify minimal perturbations to input sequences that alter model predictions, provide intuitive and actionable insights. However, existing methods often struggle to generate realistic or diverse counterfactuals, especially for sequential data with strong temporal dependencies. In this work, we propose DiverseLCF, a post-hoc framework for generating diverse and plausible counterfactual explanations for time series classifiers. By optimizing in the latent space of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE), DiverseLCF ensures that generated counterfactuals remain temporally coherent and aligned with the data manifold. We formulate the generation process as a multi-objective optimization problem that balances validity, proximity, and diversity. Extensive experiments show that DiverseLCF consistently generates valid, plausible, and diverse coun-terfactuals with minimal proximity trade-offs, providing a robust and generalizable tool for interpreting time series models."

Unlike conventional designs, all DRA elements are seamlessly integrated into a single piece of dielectric substrate, significantly easing manufacturing and markedly reducing fabrication and assembly errors. Moreover, this design achieves a self-decoupling effect by introducing additional surface-wave coupling to counteract the strong space-wave coupling. Benefiting from the loading effect of the surrounding dielectric medium, the −10 dB impedance bandwidth and half-power beamwidth (HPBW) of the DRA elements are also positively enhanced. For demonstration, a 1 × 8 substrate-integrated DRA (SIDRA) phased array was designed, simulated, fabricated, and measured. The prototype exhibits an 11.4% operating bandwidth, ranging from 23.51 to 26.35 GHz. Within this bandwidth, the average inter-element isolation is approximately 24.1 dB, and the array supports beam scanning up to ±64°."

In recent years, several adversarial attack algorithms have been proposed and achieved promising results in generating adversarial examples in the digital domain.

In this work, we propose a physically feasible adversarial attack method based on time-varying metasurface. A novel phase modulation technique is introduced to embed the global perturbation information into the radar echo signal, which will transformed into adversarial examples by the adversary’s SAR imaging processor. The resulting adversarial examples can mislead the neural network-based SAR ATR system, thereby achieving the intended adversarial attack. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through theoretical analysis and simulations, and its feasibility is further assessed under different radar operation band."

    "abstract": "In the woodworking sector, finishing operations are critical for ensuring product quality and durability, especially for high-value furniture such as dining tables. However, sanding and oiling of tropical woods like cachimbo and huayruro are still mainly performed manually, causing inconsistent surface finishes and significant health risks due to prolonged exposure to wood dust, a known human carcinogen. Although automation has advanced in cutting and assembly, few integrated finishing solutions are accessible to small and medium woodworking enterprises. Recent research on robotic sanding and UV-curable coatings has demonstrated improvements in finish uniformity and drying efficiency. This paper presents the design and validation of an affordable automated finishing system that integrates multi-stage sanding, precise oil application, UV-accelerated curing, and dust extraction. The system is controlled using a programmable logic controller (PLC) and human-machine interface (HMI) for safe, consistent operation. Laboratory tests with cachimbo and huayruro samples showed a cycle time reduction exceeding 60% compared to traditional methods, with improved finish quality and enhanced occupational safety. The results demonstrate practical feasibility for modernizing manual finishing processes in small tropical woodworking workshops."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of end - to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI), a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles, document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer. These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic, document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system, despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that improve performance in historical document writer identification."

We measured small-signal gains exceeding 10 dB between 0.3 and 0.9 GHz using impulse excitation. The maximum measured peak instantaneous output power of a negative polarity impulse was almost <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$10\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> higher than the saturated time-averaged power for CW amplification, and almost <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> higher than the saturated peak instantaneous power for CW amplification, i.e., <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4~\\pm ~0.1$</tex-math> </inline-formula> kW versus <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$175~\\pm ~25$</tex-math> </inline-formula> W and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$550~\\pm ~50$</tex-math> </inline-formula> W, respectively. We also observed impulse polarity dependence of the large-signal impulse amplification, observing a maximum peak power output of a negative polarity impulse almost <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$3\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula> higher than for a positive polarity impulse, i.e., <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4~\\pm ~0.1$</tex-math> </inline-formula> kW versus <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$550~\\pm ~50$</tex-math> </inline-formula> W. These observations are linked to differences in electron trapping and deceleration dynamics. In particular, for the negative polarity impulse, the trailing edge field predominantly decelerates electrons catching up from behind the pulse, resulting in more effective energy extraction. In contrast, the trailing edge of the positive polarity impulse exhibits predominantly accelerating fields, reducing the efficiency of energy transfer. These polarity-dependent effects are not present in CW sinusoidal amplification, for which the electrons become trapped and reaccelerated within each bunch in saturation."

    "abstract": "Search engines serve as primary gateways to information, and users tend to trust them, despite being algorithmic black boxes and customizing results in non-transparent ways. Personalization, such as tailoring content based on a user’s location, is useful for routine content searches (e.g., finding nearby restaurants). However, this same personalization becomes problematic - and potentially harmful - when users seek information on sensitive or contentious geopolitical topics. In this work, we present the first large-scale measurement of how search engine curation and personalization affect users across different countries with distinct regional, political, and cultural traits. We developed a novel, privacy-preserving, bot-based methodology that simulates online user profiles embedded with cumulative regional traits. These customized bots were deployed from different locations and conducted identical searches, either on the Israel-Palestine conflict (e.g. “Hamas”) or neutral queries (e.g. “dinner recipe”), using both Google and DuckDuckGo. Our study addresses two main questions: (1) How do search results for the same query differ across countries, and which factors drive these differences?; and (2) Does personalization vary more significantly for conflict-related or for general queries? Our findings show that search result rankings are significantly influenced by location, interface language, and simulated browsing context, with the strongest effects observed for conflict-related queries. In many cases, these differences led to non-neutral portrayals of the same event, depending on the user’s presumed region. These results highlight how search engine personalization can shape public understanding of global events, creating fragmented or biased informational environments. This underscores the importance of educating users about the invisible filters that influence their access to information and, from a policy standpoint, these findings reveal a pressing need for greater transparency and accountability in how search engines personalize politically sensitive content. This is especially urgent given their outsized role in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion worldwide."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various medical tasks, including report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, pixel-level tasks such as image segmentation remain relatively underexplored, despite their critical importance for clinical decision-making, surgical planning, and model interpretability. Moreover, the scarcity of high-quality segmentation annotations in the medical domain often leads to biased data distributions, characterized by imbalances in disease types, anatomical coverage, and image quality. These biases are frequently overlooked during both model development and evaluation, limiting the robustness and real-world applicability of VLMs in healthcare scenarios. In this study, we propose a unified medical vision-language model applicable for a variety of clinical tasks, including report generation, VQA, and pixel-level image segmentation. Within the model, we propose a semantic interaction mechanism aimed at enhancing pixel-level vision and language representation learning. To mitigate the impact of biased data distributions, we explicitly develop an adaptive refinement prompting method involving the iterative re-prompting of hard samples. The proposed method is thoroughly validated through experiments on eight datasets and comparisons with nine state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our model achieves superior performance in both medical VQA and segmentation tasks. These results highlight the potential of our approach in advancing the deployment of medical VLMs in real-world clinical applications.

    "abstract": "Accurate automatic surgical instrument segmentation plays a crucial role in robot-assisted surgery, but analyzing surgical videos remains challenging due to factors such as rapid instrument movements, high inter-category similarity, and frequent object occlusions. Current surgical instrument segmentation models struggle to capture both inter-frame variations and intra-frame details in complex surgical scenarios. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown significant potential in various segmentation tasks. However, it has not fully addressed the unique challenges posed by surgical videos. To tackle these issues, we propose a Temporal and Distance-Guided SAM model (TD-SAM) for accurate surgical instrument segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic cross-frame attention module that effectively captures temporal information across frames, allowing the model to track the dynamic changes of surgical instruments and their environment, thus improving segmentation accuracy. In addition, we present a distance-guided instance refinement module, which enhances the model's ability to distinguish between similar categories, mitigating the class ambiguity caused by inter-category similarity. Extensive experiments on the EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 datasets show that the proposed TD-SAM model outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art performance without using any prompts."

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in hyperspectral satellite missions have significantly expanded Earth Observation capabilities. Availability of high-resolution hyperspectral data and products thereof, such as those delivered by the PRISMA mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), provides unprecedented opportunities for monitoring Earth processes in a wide range of applications. Enhancement of hyperspectral image products plays a crucial role in further increasing data exploitation possibilities. In this work, we propose a unified, physics-based APproAch for joint detection of Clouds, water, and sHadows in hypErspectral images (APACHE), focusing on PRISMA L1 product enhancement. Unlike existing approaches that typically address detection of one individual surface type at a time, our methodology jointly extracts the three surfaces of interest in an automated, stepwise, and unsupervised manner. More importantly, there is no need for parameter tuning, labeled data, or multi-source images. APACHE only leverages spectral properties of clouds, water, and shadows combined with a non-parametric clustering technique. Experimental results on a variety of PRISMA images from diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in accurately detecting the surfaces of interest, both with respect to state-of-the-art methods and enhancing PRISMA products. On average, APACHE achieves accuracies of 96.42% for cloud detection, 99.23% for water detection, and 97.55% for shadow detection, with improvements ranging from 2% to 30% over the best performing comparison method. These results highlight APACHE potential to improve hyperspectral satellite data exploitation across a wide range of remote sensing applications."

Firstly, a thermodynamic model of coupled electricity-watershed networks is formulated to express risk interdependencies of power shortage and water curtailments under high-temperature climates. Then, a hypercube multi-directional inner approximation projection method is developed to evaluate variable water-dependent power dispatchable regions caused by strong couplings and heterogeneity of flexibility resources. Furthermore, a hierarchical interactive emergency scheduling strategy is proposed for coordinated water-energy flexibility enhancement within dynamic aggregated dispatchability boundaries. The proposed strategy has been fully tested and benchmarked on a practical 143-node distribution network coupled with a 14-junction watershed system to validate the effectiveness in mitigating load loss and water curtailments under drought disasters."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel unified framework that synergically combines model-based iterative algorithms with deep learning-based approaches for tomographic image reconstruction. In particular, the proposed method integrates the interpretability and adaptability of model-based techniques with the expressive power of deep learning—enabling sophisticated non-linear and data-driven priors that enhance reconstruction quality. This synergy yields a framework that is interpretable, robust, generalizable, and produces higher-quality images, effectively addressing key limitations of model-based and learning-based approaches in isolation. First, we show there exists a simple approach to generalize and accelerate Expectation Maximization algorithms which can adaptively speedup convergence based on individual voxel values. We then introduce a key re-parametrization that enables viewing multiple reconstruction algorithms as special cases of a general mapping function between iterations. Building on these insights, we propose a novel model-based deep neural network architecture that effectively is a generalized deep unrolling of a family of algorithms. The proposed method learns to reconstruct high-quality images by systematically performing the required trade-off across the represented algorithms, or it can learn a specific algorithm through training without compromising its robustness and generalization. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of PET imaging data the proposed method can be trained both in supervised and self-supervised regime. Our approach demonstrates superior adaptation with limited training data across varying noise levels, scan duration and out-of-distribution data. Experimental results show significant improvements in image quality compared to both existing iterative methods and deep learning approaches, while maintaining computational efficiency and theoretical interpretability. The associated code is publicly available online."

    "abstract": "Clustering is a significant technique in data mining, which can uncover the hidden correlation information and obtain deeper understanding of the inherent structure of data. However, when dealing with the data with extremely uneven density and increasingly complex structure, most current clustering algorithms only obtain results at a single granular level, resulting in a unilateral understanding of the data. Therefore, a novel multi-granularity clustering algorithm based on grid partition and fuzzy quotient space (MGCGF) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, by introducing the Gaussian kernel density function to characterize the distribution characteristics of data, a grid partition method is designed to select representative points for clustering. Secondly, based on the results of grid partition, the representative points composed of the maximum density values in each dimension of the grids are used for multi-granularity clustering to improve the clustering efficiency. Finally, a multi-granularity clustering algorithm is proposed by introducing fuzzy quotient space theory with representative points as input. MGCGF can be used to uncover the hierarchical structure of the data itself and form a multi-granularity space. And the clustering results with multi-granularity can be directly provided from multi-granularity spaces without re-clustering. By comparing with the other six clustering algorithms, the feasibility is verified in terms of both efficiency and accuracy."

When using wavelets for disturbance detection, the vanishing moment order (vmo) of the wavelet directly affects the detection results. The characteristics of vmo are analyzed, and the steps for detecting wavelet modulus maxima of voltage swell disturbance are given. The simulation model is established, and six types of wavelets, Sym3, Sym6, Sym10, Coif5, Bior2.8, and Bior6.8, are used to perform five-scale wavelet decomposition on the original transient disturbance signal. By comparing the modulus maxima under different conditions, it is proved that the vmo is the most important factor affecting the detection effect compared to orthogonality and support length, and the larger its value, the better the detection effect."

This study aims to determine the severity of a gear tooth failure in a spur gearbox through vibration signal analysis. Under laboratory conditions, a pinion's gear tooth break failure was simulated at different severity levels. Four accelerometers were installed vertically on the gearbox to acquire the vibration signal. Vibration signal features were initially extracted using condition indicators (CIs) in the time, frequency, and time-frequency domains. The CIs from the three domains were fused into a database, and dimensionality was reduced by eliminating highly correlated CIs and those with near-zero variance. The classification accuracy for failure severity level was then determined using the machine learning algorithms Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbours on the reduced database. Finally, a factorial ANOVA test to asses whether classification accuracy differed significantly across the four sensor positions and two models. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracy in determining the severity of a gear tooth break failure in a spur gearbox. Furthermore, sensor placement on the gearbox has a minimal impact on vibration signal feature extraction."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is a serious Neurological disorder which is prevalent among the patients in the age above 60 years and causes chronic health issues in the brain. Especially it destructs memory and thinking skills of the patients. Thus early diagnosis of the disease prevents the patients from the complete destruction of the memory and thinking skills. However many researcher has carried out various approaches using Structured Magnetic Resonance Imaging approaches to observe the structures and its cognitive function in the hippocampus regions of the brain. Despite of several advantageous, those approaches fails to determine the stage of the Alzheimer diseases due to complex structure of the MRI. In this paper, a vision transformer has been employed to convolution neural network to consider deterioration of the brain regions in different stages of the Alzheimer diseases. Initially preprocessing step is employed to eliminate the noise and non-brain tissues like skull of the MRI slices. Next, convolution Neural Network is employed as feature extraction network to segment and extract the features of the entire brain regions. Extracted feature is represented in form of feature map representing the global relationship between different structures of the brain on its characteristics. Multi Head Attention mechanism is used to determine the discriminative features on its weighted representation to Alzheimer disease characteristics through its attention coefficient. Those attention coefficient is processed in the pooling layer to represent its attention map on reducing dimensionality and non linearity of the interactions in the feature map. Finally attention map is processed in the fully connected layer using batch normalization using activation function and disease classification on basis of its disease stages through softmax function. Softmax function uses multiclass support vector machine. It classifies the Alzheimer disease into Mild Cognitive Impairment, Moderate Cognitive Impairment and Severe Cognitive Impairment. Experimental analysis and performance analysis of the proposed architecture is carried out using structured magnetic resonance imaging acquired from GRAD dataset. Model efficiency is evaluated on basis of precision, recall and f measure against state of art approaches. Proposed model produces 98.9% accuracy in staging of the diseases."

    "abstract": "Trajectory tracking remains a fundamental chal-lenge in mobile robotics, particularly for non-holonomic differential-drive robots such as those used in the IEEE Very Small Size Soccer (VSSS) competition. This work investigates and compares two control tuning approaches aimed at improving the performance of a VSSS robot in following a predefined path: the Firefly Metaheuristic Algorithm (FMA) and a traditional empirical method. The Bernoulli Lemniscate is adopted as the reference trajectory due to its variable curvature and suitability as a benchmark path in motion control tasks. Simulations in a virtual VSSS environment were conducted to evaluate tracking accuracy and system responsiveness under both strate-gies. Results show that FMA-based tuning leads to significant improvements in trajectory adherence and system stability. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how systematic optimization methods can enhance control performance in small-scale autonomous robotic systems."

    "abstract": "As the core component of electric vehicles, the SOH prediction of power battery is of great significance to the safety of the whole vehicle operation and battery life. Aiming at the problem of low prediction accuracy of traditional methods under small sample conditions, this paper proposes a CEEMDAN-LSBoostELM prediction model that integrates fully adaptive ensemble empirical modal decomposition of noise (CEEMDNA), least squares boosting (LSBoost), and extremum learning machine (ELM) based on real-vehicle operation data. First, the aging features are extracted based on the capacity incremental analysis, and the features that are highly correlated with SOH are screened by gray correlation analysis as model inputs; second, the SOH sequences are decomposed by using CEEMDAN to extend the feature dimensions; and finally, LSBoost is introduced to improve the stability and prediction performance of the ELM model. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed model on the real-vehicle dataset are significantly better than those of the CEEMDAN-ELM, ELM, RF, and MLP models, and the prediction errors are no more than 1.2%, which verifies the effectiveness of the feature enhancement and model integration strategy."

    "abstract": "In today's digital age, cybersecurity is of utmost importance to safeguard sensitive information and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. To effectively address this challenge, it is crucial to identify and predict significant cyber incidents promptly. Logarithmic neural networks excel in numerical data processing but struggle with sequential data, while seq2seq models, with their encoder-decoder architectures, are more adept at handling variable-length inputs/outputs, making them superior for sequential data tasks, particularly in NLP (Natural Language Processing) and its associated fields. With this motivation, this research suggests a novel methodology for the classification and prediction of such incidents using an optimized sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model and named as OSeq2Seq model. The Seq2seq model is a powerful deep learning architecture known for its proficiency in handling sequential data, making it well-suited for cybersecurity applications where understanding the temporal dependencies of events is essential. Furthermore, Orca Swarm Optimization (OSO) employ for hyperparameter tuning for enhancing the efficiency of the Seq2seq framework. The recommended methodology supports for the development of cybersecurity research and also provides valuable insights for developing proactive strategies to mitigate cyber threats and protect critical assets from potential security breaches. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation on real-world cyber threat datasets, the efficiency of the methodology is verified in accurately classifying and predicting significant cyber incidents (SCI) with high precision and recall."

    "abstract": "The biggest threat to network privacy and accessibility right now is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This is important because online risks are rising and more and more people count in digital services which never stop. For a long period, traditional firewalls have served as border defenses. However, these threats have evolved, and traditional firewalls' strict, rule-based screening methods are no longer sufficient. In this study, firewalls will be tested on a computer in both normal and DDoS cases to see the extent to which they work and how strong they are. A new DDoS Resilience Index (DRI) was added to a Poisson-distributed traffic framework that was used to simulate both normal and attack traffic. Throughput, packet loss rates as well as DRI were used to quantify performance. Based on the calculated DRI of 45.13 percent, the firewall's performance lowered by more than 50% at the attack, indicating a high risk of traffic overload. To check how accurate the classification was, a confusion matrix was employed. The results showed that the accuracy was 75% overall, 63% precise, and 27% false positive, which means that legal traffic might be blocked by mistake. The research results show that traditional firewalls fail in high-attack intensity scenarios and offer credence to next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), which are better at detecting threats and can alter their analysis depending on user behavior. Researchers hope that cybersecurity professionals and network architects will find the study's methodology and evaluation framework for assessing firewall performance valuable as they seek to protect organizations against emerging DDoS assaults."

However, the space and time kurtosis methods need to be more effective for narrowband signals. This letter introduces an extension to arbitrary-order kurtosis, demonstrating its potential to achieve super-resolution performances. Unlike other super-resolution techniques, the proposed method is algorithmically straightforward and does not require subwavelength structures. Numerical experiments demonstrate field concentration beyond the diffraction limit, confirming high-order kurtosis’s ability to enhance the accuracy of TR source reconstruction using band-limited fields. Additionally, its applicability to reconstructing multiple sources is established."

This paper presents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications, examining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI technologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition, we analyze 216 commercially available spectral imaging cameras, benchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial resolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature standards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated research potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the defined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In addition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including semantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability, and adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are limited in scale, spectral consistency, channel count, and environmental diversity, posing a challenge for perception algorithms development and adequate HSI's potential validation in ADAS/AD applications. This review paper presents the current state of HSI in automotive contexts and outlines key research directions toward practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems."

    "abstract": "This study presents a highly accurate and cost-efficient machine learning framework for diagnosing distributed bearing faults by identifying an optimal and compact set of frequency-domain features. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset collected from an experimental testbed comprising a coupled induction motor operating under 50 distinct combinations of speed and load. The dataset encompasses both healthy bearings and those exhibiting various distributed faults-such as lubrication degradation, contamination, electrical erosion, and flaking-as well as a localized fault in the form of a single-point defect on the outer race. Data were acquired using a multi-sensor module integrating three-axis vibration, stray magnetic flux, and two phase current signals. The primary objective is to reduce an initial set of 102 frequency-based features to a minimal subset suitable for deployment on resource-constrained microcontrollers without sacrificing classification performance. Employing Mutual Information and Random Forest techniques for feature selection, the study successfully identifies a critical subset of five features. A Random Forest classifier trained on these features achieved an impressive test accuracy of 99.58%. Furthermore, the combination of top-ranked features from both MI and RF methods led to improved classification performance over using either method independently, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of industrial bearing fault detection."

    "abstract": "Frequency-domain reflectometry is an effective technique for localizing minor defects in cables, with the broadband impedance spectrum and reflection coefficient spectrum as the primary analysis targets. A common approach to improve localization sensitivity is to compare the broadband spectra of defective and reference healthy cables. However, obtaining accurate reference healthy spectra is challenging: pre-installation data are not applicable to in-service cables; calculated spectra are highly sensitive to cable parameter accuracy; and for three-phase power cables, data from other phases may not represent the tested phase reliably. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes broadband characteristic impedance spectrum, which is derived from the impedance spectra under open- and short-circuit terminations, and then a reference-free broadband characteristic impedance spectrum method is proposed to enables the localization of minor defects in cables without requiring a reference healthy spectrum. Minor defects are localized by extracting defect-induced equivalent frequency components from the difference between the broadband characteristic impedance spectrum and its mean-valued constant vector, and then transforming them from the frequency to the spatial domain. The proposed reference-free method is validated through simulation and laboratory experiments, respectively, demonstrating that minor defects can be accurately localized with an error of no more than 0.563%. Since the method relies solely on measurements from the tested cable, it eliminates the need for a prior healthy reference spectrum, thus enabling accurate defect localization under practical applications."

    "abstract": "Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments require motion planners that can rapidly adapt to environmental changes while maintaining safety and efficiency. Frequent replanning is inevitable in such scenarios as obstacle configurations evolve and previously feasible trajectories become invalid. However, real-time replanning remains challenging for many applications due to the high computational cost of collision checking and graph maintenance, especially when edge evaluations are expensive or when the environment changes continuously. The paper introduces an asymptotically optimal lifelong sampling-based path planning algorithm that combines the merits of lifelong planning algorithms and lazy search algorithms for rapid replanning in dynamic environments where edge evaluation is expensive. The algorithm maintains an incremental search graph which is reused throughout the entire navigation process. By evaluating only sub-path candidates for the optimal solution, the algorithm saves considerable evaluation time and reduces the overall planning cost. It employs a novel informed rewiring cascade to efficiently repair the search tree when the underlying search graph changes. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution as long as sufficient planning time is given. Planning results on robotic systems with SE(3) and R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup> state spaces in challenging environments highlight the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over various state-of-the-art sampling-based planners in both static and dynamic motion planning tasks.

The IER technology can be integrated into traditional e-waste recycling pipelines to precede destructive metal extraction. This will capture more value from each PCBA and enhance recycling efficiency. The proposed system has the potential to bring mass recycling to the electronics industry by providing financial incentives to manufacturers. We estimate that each automated IER machine with 1440 components-per-hour capacity can recycle over six million components per year, pumping $300k+ of recycled value back into the economy and removing 6+ tons of e-waste from the e-waste stream. This paper introduced IER architecture and its components in detail. We discussed machine vision-based classification and identification of components on a PCBA and proposed multiple existing deep learning models as reliable classification methods to detect faulty components exhibiting physical damage marks. We also discussed how best to incorporate Blockchain in the IER system to enhance trust and transparency in the recycling pipeline and certify refurbished components through extensive testing. Finally, we calculated the estimated CapEx and OpEx values of the IER machines at various capacities. We utilized these calculations to perform a theoretical analysis of IER efficiency using real PCBA data and showed that IER can extract up to 100x more financial value than metal-extraction technologies."

Previous studies have concluded that the time budget required by drivers to resume driving after a takeover request varies with situations and different takeover variables. However, no comprehensive generalized approaches for estimating in advance the time budget required by drivers to takeover have been provided. In this contribution, fixed (7 s) and variable time budgets (6 s, 5 s, and 4 s) with and without visual imagery assistance were investigated for suitability in three takeover scenarios using performance measures such as average lateral displacement. The results indicate that 7 s is suitable for two of the studied scenarios based on their characteristics. Using the obtained results and known takeover variables, regression models were trained under different conditions to estimate the time budget required. The applied algorithms include XGBoost, support vector machines, random forest, and linear regression. Three of the algorithms namely XGBoost, support vector machines, and random forest perform well with the full feature set alongside hyperparameter turning. When behavioral and performance features were eliminated, only XGBoost performed well on the applied data yielding an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of approximately 99 %.

    "abstract": "Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks are promising heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in 6G and beyond, attributed to the complementary physical properties of optical spectra and radio frequency. However, the current physical-layer deployment of such HetNets is mainly bottlenecked by the conventional serial transmission (ST) mechanism, which restricts each user equipment (UE) from connecting multiple access points (APs) at a time. While the ongoing investigation on parallel transmission (PT) can bring significant benefits, it complicates the network topology of HetNets, making existing load balancing (LB) learning models less effective. Driven by this, we propose a graph attention network (GAT)-based model to tackle LB in PT-supported HetNets (PT-HetNets), which results in a partial mesh topology. Such a topology can be modeled as a graph, embedding the channel state information and data rate requirement as node features, with the LB solutions deemed as edge labels. Compared to the conventional deep neural network (DNN), the proposed GAT-based learning model exhibits two key strengths: i) it can better interpret a complex network topology; and ii) it can suit various numbers of APs and UEs with a single trained model. Simulation results show that against traditional optimisation methods, the proposed learning model can achieve near-optimal network throughput within a gap of 11.5% while reducing the inference time by 4 orders of magnitude. In contrast to the DNN model, this novel method can improve the network throughput by up to 21.7%, at a similar level of inference time."

In contrast to existing methods, which often fail to account for the impacts of significant translational motion or are only effective under small linear accelerations, this work introduces a linear acceleration compensation method that dynamically adjusts measurement uncertainties in real-time. This method addresses a critical limitation in previous approaches, enabling higher accuracy during significant motion. The proposed method leverages two extended Kalman filters (EKFs): six degrees of freedom EKF for attitude estimation and nine degrees of freedom EKF for 3D position estimation, which are coupled for enhanced performance. The experimentally validated results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving root mean square errors of 1.96 degrees for attitude estimation and 0.57 m for position estimation, while reducing computational complexity by 58.32%. This approach excels in challenging indoor environments with mixed line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions, demonstrating its robustness and applicability to real-world scenarios. This work presents a significant advancement in the field of 3D localisation, offering both theoretical contributions and practical improvements over existing systems."

Analyzing and comparing calligraphic styles not only enhances the appreciation, learning, and advancement of calligraphy but also provides valuable insights into ancient China. However, such analysis remains challenging due to the limited scalability and possible inconsistencies of qualitative methods, as well as usability and misalignment issues in conventional quantitative approaches. We propose Calli-VA, a visual analytics system, to address these challenges. Calli-VA extracts character images and their corresponding strokes from original works and characterizes each character using systematic criteria. During analysis, the system defines the analysis scope by overview and uncovers relationships between characters. Explanation and recommendation mechanisms are integrated to help users understand patterns and guide further exploration. A documentation feature allows users to record and share their findings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Calli-VA through three case studies and expert feedback."

However, finetuning these large models requires substantial computational resources, often with suboptimal task-specific results. This study investigates how parameter-efficient finetuning via LoRA can enhance protein property prediction while significantly reducing computational demands. By applying LoRA to ESM-2 and ESM-C models of varying sizes and evaluating 10 diverse protein property prediction tasks, we demonstrate that smaller models with LoRA adaptation can match or exceed the performance of larger models without adaptation. Additionally, we integrate contact map information through a multi-head attention mechanism, improving model comprehension of structural features. Our systematic analysis reveals that LoRA finetuning enables faster convergence, better performance, and more efficient resource utilization, providing practical guidance for protein research applications in resource-constrained environments.

    "abstract": "Underwater data is inherently scarce and exhibits complex distributions, making it challenging to train high-performance models from scratch. In contrast, in-air models are structurally mature, resource-rich, and offer strong potential for transfer. However, significant discrepancies in visual characteristics and feature distributions between underwater and in-air environments often lead to severe performance degradation when applying in-air models directly. To address this issue, we propose IA2U, a lightweight plugin designed for efficient underwater adaptation without modifying the original model architecture. IA2U can be flexibly integrated into arbitrary in-air networks, offering high generalizability and low deployment cost. Specifically, IA2U incorporates three types of prior knowledge—water type, degradation pattern, and sample semantics—which are embedded into intermediate layers through feature injection and channel-wise modulation to guide the network’s response to underwater-specific features. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature alignment module is introduced to dynamically balance information across different resolution paths, enhancing consistency and contextual representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IA2U significantly improves both image enhancement and object detection performance. Specifically, on the UIEB dataset, IA2U boosts Shallow-UWNet by 5.2 dB in PSNR and reduces LPIPS by 52%; on the RUOD dataset, it increases AP by 1.8% when applied to the PAA detector. IA2U provides an effective and scalable solution for building robust underwater perception systems with minimal adaptation cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujingchun03/IA2U."

    "abstract": "In humanoid robot soccer, the control of the kick motion plays an important role in various situations from ball challenges and passes to shots on goal. Improving kick performance requires not only increasing its power, but also reducing its duration and enhancing accuracy, all while maintaining stability. For instance, methods that require the robot to completely stop before kicking are disadvantageous in ball challenge scenarios. Additionally, approaches that rely on predefined swing foot trajectories demand highly precise positioning relative to the ball, which increases execution time and may compromise kick accuracy. This paper contributes by proposing methods for generating both the swing foot trajectory and the robot's center of mass trajectory to enable accurate and stable kicking during continuous walking. The swing foot trajectory is generated online as a B-spline, based on time-varying inputs such as the ball position and the desired shot direction. Meanwhile, the torso trajectory is generated by a model predictive controller as a continuation of the walking motion. The method was validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful kick execution without interrupting gait while preserving kick power."

The suggested system is designed with a two-tiered architecture: one layer for decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) for continuous navigation planning and another layer for centralized Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) for dynamic target allocation. The system uses a probabilistic ensemble-based interaction mechanism to evaluate epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, as well as dynamically changes the job reassignment frequency depending on environmental unpredictability, to provide adaptive coordination. According to the experimental findings, the HRL technique is considerably more effective and flexible compared to traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. Particularly, HRL has a 91%-win rate by 20 agents as opposed to DRL’s 72%, so as the number of agents rises, it keeps making better decisions with less computing work. Regarding real-time multi-agent robots functioning in complex and variable settings, these results emphasize HRL’s resilience, flexibility, and feasibility."

The analytical equations were implemented in functional blocks in Simulink, allowing the joints to be actuated according to predefined trajectories. To ensure smooth and continuous movements, these trajectories were parameterized by third-degree Bezier curves. Gaits were defined as coordinated sequences, with independent phase, length and step height adjustments. Stability was assessed visually in Mechanics Explorer and quantified in MATLAB, which calculates in real time the support polygon formed by the legs in contact with the ground. The simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the gaits, keeping the center of mass within the stability zone."

However, since Ayurvedic knowledge is scattered across so many ancient texts, it becomes a time-consuming task for students as well as experienced practitioners to identify the most appropriate herbal medicine for some symptoms. To get over this obstacle, our project proposes a smart recommendation system designed to match symptoms with the correct Ayurvedic formulations. The system collects information from more than 150 classical texts and organizes it in a searchable format by symptoms, Ayurvedic properties (Rasa, Guna, Virya, and Vipaka), and recognized contraindications. The system intelligently omits recipes that include ingredients unsuitable for conditions like diabetes or alcohol intolerance. Multilingual, neat user interfaces are also provided to make sure the system is easily usable by people of various backgrounds. Merging the age-old healing knowledge with the wisdom of the computer world, the system aims to assist practitioners and students in making faster, safer, and more accurate treatment decisions. The system may be further enhanced with natural language processing and artificial intelligence to ensure even better accuracy in interpreting and understanding symptoms."

A custom hybrid CNN architecture is developed to detect and classify facial features by leveraging both pre-trained models and fine-tuned layers specifically optimized for criminal identification. The model is trained on publicly available criminal face datasets and is designed for real-time performance. The application automatically matches faces captured in CCTV footage with known criminal databases and generates alerts upon identifying a match. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid CNN method significantly improves precision, recall, and processing speed compared to conventional techniques.

The methodology, inspired by aerospace material selection techniques, incorporates expert input and validation to ensure practical applicability. Results identify six critical KPls, including reliability, availability, and corrective maintenance cost percentage, which enhance proactive maintenance strategies.

    "abstract": "Classifier ensembles are mainly used for classification problems exhibiting complex data characteristics, e.g., a high class imbalance. They consist of a set of classifiers and a decision fusion method that combines the predictions of the classifiers. However, creating an accurate ensemble is a challenging optimization problem, since the individual classifiers and the decision fusion method must be selected from a huge search space that consists of numerous classification and fusion algorithms. Thereby, the selected classifiers have to be both accurate and diverse, so that they complement each other and make correct predictions on different data subsets. In addition, the selected decision fusion method has to accurately combine the predictions of individual classifiers into a consensus decision. Current literature focuses on AutoML approaches that reduce the complexity of the optimization problem by omitting the optimization of the classifier diversity and of the decision fusion. In this paper, we propose Auto-CEn as a novel ensemble approach based on AutoML that efficiently solves the optimization problem by selecting a set of accurate and diverse classifiers for the ensemble and by optimizing the decision fusion. In our extensive evaluation on 20 real-world datasets, we show that Auto-CEn outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines and that this improvement is mainly attributed to its novel contributions of diversity-based classifier selection and decision fusion optimization."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a torsional oscillation damping field-oriented control (FOC) strategy for a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) powered by a 5-level (5L) Knight multilevel inverter (MLI), utilizing a phase disposition pulse-width modulation (PD PWM) technique. This strategy enables true 5L operation while maintaining balanced conditions for the DC-link capacitors. Additionally, the PD PWM switching methodology is a sophisticated and analytical modulation technique that offers several advantages over conventional PWM methods, including reduced harmonic content and improved overall efficiency of the system. Due to its numerous benefits, PD PWM is increasingly being adopted in power converters and motor control applications. FOC with torsional oscillation damping method for PMSM drives is often chosen for its exceptional efficiency and performance unique features such as increased power density, low inertia, and improved power factor. Additionally the inclusion of a torsional damping current loop within the FOC enhances transient torque stability and mitigates oscillations under dynamic load. The suggested MLI under evaluation is a reduced-switch inverter that produces 5Ls of output using eight power switches per phase. It can operate across a range of voltage levels without the need for power semiconductors connected in series. In contrast to the neutral point clamped NPC MLI; the suggested topology reduces switching stress by utilizing only two switches per inverter leg rather than four.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a whole-body impedance coordinative control framework for a wheel-legged humanoid robot to achieve adaptability on complex terrains while maintaining the robot's upper body stability. The framework contains a bi-level control strategy. The outer level is a variable-damping impedance controller, which optimizes the damping parameters to ensure the stability of the upper body while holding an object. The inner level employs whole-body control (WBC) optimization that integrates real-time terrain estimation based on wheel-foot position and force data. It generates motor torques while accounting for dynamic constraints, joint limits, friction cones, real-time terrain updates, and a model-free friction compensation strategy. The proposed whole-body coordinative control method, tested on a newly developed quadruped humanoid robot, effectively enables passive stable manipulation for both indoor water-carrying and outdoor box-carrying tasks across varying and uneven terrains."

Evaluated on TUM and BONN datasets, A-SPAM achieves at least 76.8% recall rate at 100% precision in dynamic environments, while maintaining a mean translational error of less than 0.07 m across dynamic sequences under degraded odometry conditions.

    "abstract": "End-to-end paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to autonomous driving. However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these limitations, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM)</i> and propose an interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate future research in this field."

Crying is the most effective tool through which babies convey their requirements. In this work, several studies dealing with infant cry detection and classification are contrasted. Research demonstrates that machine learning techniques can effectively categorize and classify infant needs and certain disorders. Several datasets, including Baby Chillanto, Donate A Cry Corpus and Dunstan Baby Language, are presented. After reviewing existing Datasets, preprocessing methodologies and audio feature extraction such as MFCC, RMS energy, etc., are discussed. For infant cry detection and classification, several algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, etc., have been analyzed and utilized for such processes in general. Finally, the study explores various applications of infant cry analysis, highlighting its potential to improve infant care and facilitate early diagnosis. As a result of the findings, it has been observed that infant cry analysis can effectively identify different needs and potential health concerns with high accuracy. These machine learning models' classification outputs have the potential to (1) improve childcare practices, (2) detect medical issues earlier, and (3) monitor infants continuously. These features give medical professionals and caregivers useful information for prompt intervention. The implementation of these findings can be applied in hospitals, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), smart baby monitoring systems, and research studies focused on early childhood development."

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal graph modeling aims to model temporally varying and spatially correlated information sequences in the traffic network, serving as a significant approach to capture the complex, dynamic, and nonlinear changes of traffic systems. Consequently, it plays a crucial role in enhancing the reliability of intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods extract traffic data’s features by designing sophisticated spatiotemporal graph neural network models, and have reached a bottleneck. Furthermore, these spatiotemporal graph models adjust their parameters globally across different datasets, limiting their generalizability and universality. Meanwhile, the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has greatly progressed in natural language processing. This paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Pre-trained Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GAPSTGCN) to break through the bottleneck of spatiotemporal modeling of traffic data. Specifically, by developing a spatiotemporal graph encoder that incorporates domain knowledge about traffic system behavior and network science. The module can extract the dynamic change trend of data from the fusion process of spatiotemporal features, while introducing a time-gating mechanism that enhances its effectiveness in medium and long-term predictions. Moreover, we embed the encoding network into the generator and discriminator. Subsequently, we employ the concept of adversarial data generation to pre-train the spatiotemporal graph neural networks, enhancing the model’s knowledge emergence capabilities. Besides, we design an adapter for downstream task prediction to bridge the gap between pre-training and prediction tasks, aligning pre-trained features with downstream task features. Extensive experiments indicate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the datasets. Experiments conducted on various types of traffic datasets further demonstrate the model’s generality."

    "abstract": "Channel estimation in a fading environment can be regarded as a typical statistical estimation problem. Its optimal performance relies on the prior distribution of the channel coefficients, which are environment-specific. However, the conventional channel estimators, such as the least square (LS) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimators, do not fully exploit the prior channel distribution law. To address this limitation, we propose to use the conditional diffusion model (DM) to achieve environment-aware channel estimation, referred to as EACE-DM. In this framework, the environment information is incorporated as the condition to guide the EACE-DM in learning the hidden features of channels from various environments. The trained EACE-DM is functionally decomposed into two components, i.e., the environment identification module and the channel estimation module. The environment identification module first uses the DM’s forward process to diffuse LS channel estimation into a noisy sample. Then it executes the DM’s reverse denoising process conditioned on candidate environments to recover the LS estimation from the noisy channel. The environment is then identified via maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation by comparing these recovered estimations with the ground-truth LS estimation. Finally, the identified environment is utilized to guide the channel estimation module, denoising the LS estimation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed EACE-DM significantly decreases normalized mean square errors (NMSEs) of channel estimation across diverse environments while incurring a moderate increase in computational complexity compared to conventional estimators and existing DM-based approaches."

    "abstract": "A smart agriculture system integrates sensors into coconut trees to collect essential data for analyzing and preventing pests, diseases, and other threats. Red palm weevils are a pest that causes much damage to coconut trees (CoT) and can cause devastation to vast areas of coconut trees. Coconut tree infestations by weevils are not visible to humans until they reach an advanced stage. To overcome this issue, a novel IoT-based COMICS model is proposed for detecting Red Palm Weevils (RPW) in CoT utilizing a microphone sensor and stem image in the early stage. Environmental data is captured using an image capture device and a coconut microphone sensor. Initially, the input coconut tree images are denoised using Savitzky-Golay (SavG) filter to reduce the noise artifacts. Then, the denoised coconut tree images are fed into the detection process using CAB-RetinaNet to detect damaged trees (DT) and no damaged trees (NDT). The coconut microphone sensor collects the audio signals, which are transformed into spectrograms. That signal is identified as the sound of the RPW and the Positional Encoding self-attention BiGRU (PEN-BiGRU) model is used to determine the presence or absence of RPW. The outputs from both visual and audio analyses are fused in a decision-making module that uses fuzzy rules to evaluate coconut tree health and notify farmers through an IoT Blynk App. According to the collected dataset, the proposed COMICS model’s performance analysis yields a total accuracy (ACY) of 99.54%. The proposed COMICS model increases the total ACY by 2.68%, 8.57%, 7.87%, 7.07% and 38.34% of YOLOv5, ResNet50, YOLOv3, CocoNet model, and ResNet respectively."

To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability, radar information rate and coverage probability for sensing. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks."

A general procedure is also introduced to identify and pinpoint non-deterministic implementations, regardless of whether they are covered in this letter. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the non-deterministic implementations are the major or potentially sole causes of non-reproducibility under constant experimental conditions. Additionally, the non-reproducibility is noteworthy in datasets obtained from low- vertical-resolution LiDARs or recorded in geometrically degenerate scenes."

    "abstract": "In complex environments, centroid and focus slip in high-speed cruise vehicles can degrade maneuverability and stability, necessitating the urgent adoption of relaxed static stability techniques to address this. However, the classical fuel transfer method has slow response limitations when regulating the static stability of high-speed cruise vehicles with fast time-varying characteristics. To overcome this limitation and expand the performance envelope, a moving-mass control scheme is introduced, and a moving-mass high-speed cruise vehicle is presented. Firstly, a seven-degree-of-freedom model of the vehicle is established using the Newton-Euler method, and the manipulation mechanism of moving-mass control is revealed. Secondly, considering the coupling effect of the moving-mass mechanism, the benefits and influences of moving-mass control on the trimmed lift-drag ratio and normal available overload are quantitatively analyzed. The variation law of the coupling characteristics is clarified through parameter sensitivity analyses. Finally, for the vibration control problem after the slider moves to the desired position, a fractional-order PD controller is designed based on the analytical solution and fixed-point theory. The approximate analytical solution for the multi-dimensional coupled system composed of the slider and the pitch attitude is obtained using the averaging method. Drawing on the analytical solution, the auxiliary design conditions for the static stability margin in this vehicle's aerodynamic layout and the optimal design formula for the controller parameters are derived. Comparisons under harmonic, impact, square wave, and random excitations show that the optimized fractional-order PD has outstanding advantages in terms of broadband vibration reduction and output force, among other aspects."

By leveraging the instantaneous CRLB, the approach proposed in this correspondence minimizes UE position estimation errors and enhances hardware utilization, achieving near-optimal performance with lower computational overhead. The system consists of an unsynchronized single antenna UE communicating with a network of time- and phase synchronized RSs distributed across a wide area. To this end, we first formulate UE position estimation problem as a joint estimation of position, clock offset, and phase offset and derive the corresponding maximum-likelihood estimator. We then conduct a Fisher information analysis to gain fundamental insights into the achievable performance and inspect the CRLB numerically. Finally, using these steps, we present a two-stage RSs selection method whose goal is to satisfy the instantaneous CRLB con dition, thereby, improving the UE position estimation accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method requires only a small subset of RSs to achieve significant performance gains, while maintaining low computational complexity and delivering superior PEB, spectral efficiency, and runtime performance compared to existing methods."

We conducted a user study (n=22) to compare the effects of View (VR vs. AR), Haptic Intensity, Visual Rendering and Intensity on vibration intensity perception, and demonstrate that pseudo-haptics enhance vibration intensity perception with a significant result for equivalence between AR and VR. Qualitative feedback shows that agency and self-causality (e.g. believing to be the source of the vibration) increases the interaction believability. Overall, Flexible Reality’s concept demonstrates how reality can seamlessly be made flexible in co-located AR and highlights the importance of ethical considerations in futuristic AR scenarios, especially involving sensory illusions."

A dual-gate complementary fusion module is introduced to dynamically adjust weighting coefficients, optimizing the accuracy of defect depth quantification. Moreover, the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for batching (LAMB) optimizer is employed to improve training efficiency and stability during large-scale model training.Experimental results demonstrate that Amcf-ResNet significantly reduces quantification errors for defects, achieving length and width errors of less than 0.1 mm, and a depth error below 0.15<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> of the material thickness (t). Compared to existing advanced algorithms, the average error of the method in this article is reduced by about 1.8 to 7.5 times, with a more significant reduction compared to traditional methods.The proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy and efficiency of 3-D defect reconstruction in MFL inspections, providing more reliable technical support for pipeline safety assessment and maintenance."

    "abstract": "Diverse vehicle forensics and in-vehicle intrusion detections researches are effectively adopted to the vehicle domain. However, known vehicle forensic researches rarely comprise outputs that are directly usable for investigators; outputs can ideally be auditable, mapped with Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and presented as a timeline-driven incident report. This gap between research outputs and practical requirements creates tangible difficulties in real-world investigations. When forensic analysis fails to yield usable results, investigators must revert to manual spreadsheets and makeshift documents, increasing time and operational costs. Furthermore, even when connections between evidence are established, improper structuring of the attack, such as failing to build a coherent timeline, compromises traceability. To address these challenges of manual analysis and inadequate traceability, we propose a DataBase CAN (DBC)-independent vehicle forensics framework. First, the framework processes raw data by reconciling clocks, normalizing multi-source evidence, and segmenting attacks into episodes using Isolation Forest and change-point detection. Finally, it utilizes a small LLM integrated with the Threat Report ATT&CK Mapper (TRAM) and Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto- ISAC) Automotive Threat Matrix (ATM) to automatically generate CTI-mapped, evidence-linked timeline reports. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our framework, we validated it against three diverse public datasets: the VeReMi dataset, the HCRL Car-Hacking dataset, and the OTIDS dataset. Our evaluation focused on three key metrics: timeline fidelity, detection and segmentation quality, and CTI mapping accuracy. The results confirmed that the framework successfully generates systematic reports, organizing observed attacks into evidence-linked timelines with CTI mappings. This approach enhances auditability and traceability, reduces the time to report, and ultimately makes the findings directly actionable for investigators."

This has made it important to have fast stream processing systems for handling large amounts of time-sensitive data. Due to their inherent delay and restricted ability to scale, traditional batch processing systems are not effective in these types of scenarios. Employing technologies like Apache Kafka to handle data ingestion, Apache Flink to process distributed stream, InfluxDB to store time-series, along with Grafana for real-time visualization, this study suggests the modular, minimal latency, high-throughput real-time stream processing design developed for IoT applications. For adaptive analytics and anomaly detection, the system combines cloud-based deep learning (LSTM) with lightweight edge-based Machine Learning (ML) models.The simulated IoT ecosystem was created using high-frequency sensor data produced by both actual and resembled devices to assess the architecture. Experimental findings reveal that the system greatly outperforms conventional batch systems by regularly achieving sub-second latency (0.6s–0.8s), scalable throughput (up to 10,000 events/second), along enhanced event identification accuracy (from 85% to 93%). The results illustrate that the suggested design may provide reliable, scalable insights for smart city, automated manufacturing and environmental monitoring applications. For intelligent IoT infrastructures to be ready for the future, the study shows that real-time processing models are necessary and feasible for implementation."

The controller decides between using electrical power from the electrical grid and the electrical power from the photovoltaic system, this makes the function of hybrid controller. The controller uses voltage hysteresis that refers to the difference in voltage levels that cause a circuit to change state depending on whether the voltage is rising or falling, this means that a circuit's output does not instantly change to the input voltage, hysteresis helps prevent rapid and unwanted changes in a circuit's output, especially in the presence of noise or voltage fluctuations. Additionally, the controller has an Internet of Things monitoring system designed and manufactured by the authors of this same research. The controller works with a conventional photovoltaic system, using a photovoltaic panel, a battery and a load, but use voltage hysteresis control. Panel voltage depends on atmospheric conditions such as cloud cover and temperature. The monitoring system has taken data to evaluate the controller's performance and results that even with intense fluctuations in panel voltage, the battery voltage remains stable, as does the load voltage. This demonstrates satisfactory system performance."

    "abstract": "Effective agricultural planning depends on precise weather forecasting, especially in areas susceptible to climate change. This paper suggests a machine learning-based method to forecast weather conditions utilizing a mix of meteorological information, satellite pictures, along with real-time sensor inputs. Starting with the collection of multiple sources of data such as humidity, wind speed, temperature, as well as soil parameters, the approach covers the whole pipeline. Preprocessing techniques including mean imputation for values that are missing, Z-score normalization, and PCA (principal component analysis) dimensionality reduction follow. The system investigates many prediction models including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, Support Vector Regression (the SVR), as well Random Forest Regression. Eighty percent of the data is used to optimize model training; K-fold cross-validation then validates it to reduce overfitting. Metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), root mean square errors (the RMSE), as well as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to evaluate performance. Key meteorological factors are then predicted using the trained model; they are then included into agricultural decision-making systems like pest management, irrigation planning, and crop selection. The method also enables continual model improvement by always updating with fresh data to preserve accuracy and flexibility. By use of data-driven weather forecasting, this all-encompassing system shows a scalable and smart approach to improving agricultural output."

Irregular and imprecise maneuvers and inclined or irregular surfaces, during landing, result in abrupt landings, rollovers, or damage to the drone. This problem is more prevalent in repetitive missions and uncontrolled environments where the precision of landing the drone is fundamental. This project proposes the design and development of an adaptive autonomous landing system for quadcopter drones. The descent to the platform will be made by implementing an assisted landing technique based on ArUco marker detection. This allows us to calculate the relative position and orientation between the drone and the platform with the ArUco marker and thus designate the route for a safe descent. In addition, the drone will have a landing gear that allows it to land on slightly inclined surfaces. The landing gear will regulate the position of its legs according to the inclination of the drone with respect to the platform with the ArUco marker. The final result of the article is that the drone will make a precise and safe landing on the platform with the ArUco marker, which will be on an inclined surface, thus reducing the damage caused by abrupt landings. The validation of the results will be done through 3D simulations using Gazebo ROS and physical tests."

In the context of the increasing utilisation of artificial intelligence, the recognition of these recordings is becoming increasingly important. Thereby, the generalization of the detectors is a major challenge in audio deepfake detection (ADD). We analysed six feature representations: MFCC, LFCC, Wav2Vec2.0 and three pre-trained encoders of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems (Whisper, SpeechT5, Canary) for ADD. For evaluating their generalizability, we trained the models on the ASVspoof 2019 LA train set and tested on the in-the-wild (ITW) test set. Furthermore, we evaluated the training time of the models, analysed the effect of additional (newer) training data and performed a correlation analysis. The ASR encoders were outperformed by using simple MFCC features, achieving an EER of 17.96% on the ITW test set with the lowest training time (7 min. per epoch). The best results were calculated using Wav2Vec 2.0 (+MFCC) with an EER of 17.60%, but using additional training data, and a training time of 135 min. per epoch. Wav2Vec also showed the highest correlations in varying training settings, indicating the best predictability of the model's performance."

This work investigates the integration of semantic segmentation for matching satellite and sonar images.

Experimental results indicate that, while convolutional networks deliver efficient and accurate segmentation of salient structures, attention-based models improve matching performance in complex scenarios by modeling long-range spatial dependencies. Among the architectures evaluated, MA-Net achieves superior performance, with a pixel accuracy of 0.9519, a mean IoU of 0.9494, and a matching score of 0.3618, underscoring the effectiveness of attention mechanisms. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on unified segmentation and matching frameworks specifically designed for autonomous underwater navigation."

In this work, we propose Graph Convolutional Network with Multi-Scale Pooling to classify three-dimensional objects. Previous research very rarely undertakes the transformation of point clouds into graphs and the use of increasingly popular graph networks. Researchers focus on transforming 3D points into voxels and using classical CNN or 3D CNN convolutional networks or methods that directly use the entire cloud, as is evident in the PointNet model. Therefore, we focused on transforming our data into irregular structures (graphs) and classifying them. Our proposed method increases the possibilities for point cloud interpretation by taking into account the relationships between points in space. In order to achieve even better accuracy results, we use the integration of two pooling techniques in the final stage of the model. Our GCN with Multi-Scale Pooling architecture has been trained and tested on the ModeiNetl0 dataset, achieving high-quality metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score compared to other classical SOTA models in the classification domain. Additionally, we carried out experiments based on ShapeNet Core dataset, for which our network achieved almost 100% accuracy. In addition, we showed that our proposed model is built from a much smaller number of parameters compared to other modern methods."

    "abstract": "One of the key challenges faced by companies in the plastics sector is meeting global efficiency standards. This paper presents an improvement proposal for the plastic bag production line of a Peruvian company, which exhibited low efficiency in the cutting area compared to industry benchmarks, as measured by Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Machine availability and quality were identified as the primary contributing factors, with issues such as equipment breakdowns, extended setup times, and frequent reprocessing. To address these issues, an engineering improvement model was developed, incorporating the Single-Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) methodology and the planned and autonomous maintenance pillars of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), integrated with Industry 4.0 tools. Planned maintenance was implemented through a digital model supported by e-Lean software, while autonomous maintenance followed a traditional approach enhanced by Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies. As a result, availability and quality in the cutting area improved by 5.09% and 3.38%, respectively, raising the OEE from 80.59% to 86.17%. These improvements enabled the company to close the performance gap and meet the efficiency standards required by the plastics industry."

    "abstract": "RepositORE is a collaborative web platform for registering learning objects and educational robotics activities. Manually adding new objects - with their 32 metadata fields each - quickly becomes a tedious and discouraging process for users. This complexity discourages educators and developers from incorporating new resources and maintaining the repository up-to-date. Automating the extraction and completion of metadata would reduce errors, save time, and encourage sharing new content, thereby strengthening the robotics education ecosys-tem. Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on vast text corpora, are capable of understanding the nuances of human language and generating contextualized responses. Owing to their prior training across diverse domains, they can handle questions and commands on a wide variety of subjects, thereby enhancing educational applications and efficiently automating complex tasks. This article presents a methodology for automatically evaluating and capturing educational robotics content from text content. This methodology employs Prompt Engineering (PE) to guide the LLMs in locating and extracting from heterogeneous sources, improving the precision and consistency of the outputs. The developed subsystem, RobotFinder v3, extracts metadata from web sites that contain relevant material and incorporates it into RepositORE. It was also applied to extract robotics-specific metadata through the analysis of YouTube video subtitles using LLMs. For this purpose, we employed the Llama 3.1, DeepSeek R-l, and Gemma 3 models for relevance assessment and data extraction. In our experiments, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 3 demonstrated superior performance in this highly specialized context."

This consumption represents the actual demand for electricity from the power supply, making accurate forecasting essential for effective electricity output planning. Knowledge of future electricity usage is vital to maximize use and, if possible, minimize use. It is especially vital in the case of electricity, as it is used to make decisions regarding power system planning and operation. A key novelty of this work is the unified benchmarking of nine deep learning architectures under consistent preprocessing and evaluation conditions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking optimal models for time series energy forecasting. Furthermore, the application of weekly aggregation provides a practical forecasting framework suitable for energy planning and smart grid operations. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of deep learning and hybrid neural network architectures for weekly residential electricity usage forecasting using the IHEPC dataset. The novelty of this work lies in the integration and empirical evaluation of nine diverse deep learning models—CNN, LSTM, GRU, MLP, Autoencoder, Aggregated CNN, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM—under a unified framework. Notably, we investigate hybrid and aggregated architectures, such as CNN-BiLSTM and Aggregated CNN, which synergize spatial and temporal learning capabilities, and benchmark them against traditional deep models to assess their effectiveness in capturing complex consumption patterns."

A tubular combustion chamber prototype was developed to facilitate controlled combustion experiments, with spectral data collected across ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges. The two-color method was refined by systematically varying the wavelength difference, identifying 100 nm as the optimal value for accurate temperature estimation. The results indicate that the flame temperature of propane gas is approximately 1900 K, consistent with its controlled combustion properties. In contrast, the flame temperature of sugarcane bagasse was determined to be around 1750 K, with variations attributed to the inherent instability and heterogeneity of biomass combustion. The spectral analysis also revealed emission peaks at 590 nm and 770 nm, corresponding to sodium and potassium emissions, respectively, which influence temperature calculations. This research demonstrates the applicability of non-invasive spectrometric techniques for combustion diagnostics and provides insights into the thermal behavior of biomass and fossil fuels. The findings contribute to advancements in energy optimization and environmental monitoring by enabling precise characterization of combustion processes."

We propose a novel methodology that statically reconstructs microservice source code into a formal system model. From this model, a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) constraint set can be derived, enabling formal verification. Our methodology is extensible, supporting software verification across multiple cross-cutting concerns. We focus on applying the methodology to verify the system architecture concern, presenting formal reasoning to validate the methodology's correctness and applicability for this concern. Additional concerns such as security policy implementation are considered. Future directions are established to extend and evaluate the methodology."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency (~11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems. The code of DyCAF-Net is available at https://github.com/Abrar2652IDyCAF-NET."

The model was trained and validated using a dataset of 120 samples of RGB images and corresponding masks. The dataset is subject to preprocessing and data augmentation to normalize samples in varying environment conditions to enhance performance. The training and validation is performed with 70 epochs and batch size 8. The study resulted into a precision of 0.70, recall of 0.77, F1-score of 0.73, and accuracy of 0.76. The other key metrics such as IoU and mAP were quantified across varying IoU thresholds. The U-Net model exhibits superior segmentation capabilities towards plant region identification. The visual observations on the outcomes between predicted plant regions and ground truth masks confirms the model’s effectiveness. The predicted masks are accurate and useful for subsequent processing in deep learning/machine learning workflows to detect crop diseases and yield estimation. The numerical scores signify that model performs well at lower IoU thresholds with high precision and recall.

    "abstract": "In situated visualization, digital data is linked to physical referents in the user's environment. However, when the environment contains multiple physical referents (e.g., buildings in an urban scale model), some may be occluded by others, complicating the user's ability to point and select them. This issue is well-known in VR, and the literature offers various techniques of occlusion reduction to support pointing at the initially occluded virtual objects in VR. These techniques can be organized into three main categories: moving the objects to reveal them; turning the occluder transparent to reveal the objects behind it; using an additional view to reveal the occluded objects. However, it is uncertain whether these techniques are well-suited to reveal occluded physical referents in AR environments. In this paper, we propose occlusion reduction techniques dedicated to AR, i.e., used for revealing occluded physical referents in AR and allowing their selection. To this end, we apply and evaluate the three types of VR techniques in an AR context. The results suggest the need for improvements to better fit the physical context. We therefore propose three future works based on the results of the study."

Given the current state of the interface and previous states, our approach infers the command that would have been most appropriate and suggests it to the users. We discuss three case studies: shape, image and text editors. For each of them, we study the feasibility of the approach through proofs of concept.

    "abstract": "As a consequence of high temporal resolution and non-invasive signal acquisition, electroencephalography (EEG) has been a necessary tool in neurological research and applications. However, processing and analysis of EEG get consistently hampered by unavoidable interference of electrooculogram (EOG) or eye-blink artifacts. EEG information loss during eye-blink artifact separation is a substantial downside for majority of existing artifact removal methods. In this paper, we have developed a technique which integrates orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to automatically estimate and remove eye-blink artifacts from contaminated EEG, with almost zero EEG information loss. A LSTM network is designed and trained to classify the eye-blink region from OMP representation of contaminated EEG, through exploiting the dominating feature of eye-blinks. Due to the relaxed sparse representation, OMP coefficients exhibit distinct pattern in eye-blink contaminated region. Another LSTM network is designed and trained to detect this pattern and classify the coefficients. Based upon these classifications, only necessary coefficients from contaminated region construct the eye-blink signal which ensures almost zero EEG information loss. Both simulated and real dataset are used for performance evaluation of proposed method and for comparison with other techniques. Estimation performance on simulated data are measured by relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC), both in time and frequency domain. Obtained results from both simulated and real data, authenticate the superiority of proposed method over other existing techniques."

    "abstract": "Retinal disease diagnosis faces critical annotation bottlenecks due to extensive expert-labeling requirements, which limit the deployment of automated diagnostic systems. We developed an FMUE (Foundation Model with Uncertainty Estimation)-based active learning framework that integrates evidential uncertainty estimation to enable efficient retinal diagnosis across optical coherence tomography (OCT) and color fundus photography (CFP) modalities. Our approach employs FMUE's uncertainty-aware classifier to guide sample selection through evidential deep learning principles. Evaluation across four retinal datasets demonstrates consistent superiority over traditional active learning methods, including entropy-based selection and Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), with pronounced improvements at low-annotation scenarios. The framework achieves accuracy improvements of 0.249 for CFP and 0.194 for OCT from 2% to 4% annotation data, substantially outperforming competing methods (0.014-0.059 and 0.047-0.058 ranges, respectively). Additionally, it delivers a sample selection speed that is 9 times faster compared to BALD in a specific environment. Sample selection analysis reveals that evidential uncertainty guidance results in a more balanced category distribution and increased attention to underrepresented diseases. These findings establish that combining foundation models with evidential uncertainty estimation effectively addresses retinal imaging annotation challenges, providing practical clinical advantages through improved selection mechanisms and computational efficiency."

We propose FreeEdit, a novel approach for achieving such reference-based image editing, which can accurately reproduce the visual concept from the reference image based on user-friendly language instructions. Our approach leverages the multi-modal instruction encoder to encode language instructions to guide the editing process. This implicit way of locating the editing area eliminates the need for manual editing masks. To enhance the reconstruction of reference details, we introduce the Decoupled Residual Refer-Attention (DRRA) module. This module is designed to integrate fine-grained reference features extracted by a detail extractor into the image editing process in a residual way without interfering with the original self-attention. Given that existing datasets are unsuitable for reference-based image editing tasks, particularly due to the difficulty in constructing image triplets that include a reference image, we curate a high-quality dataset, FreeEdit, using a newly developed twice-repainting scheme. FreeEdit comprises the images before and after editing, detailed editing instructions, as well as a reference image that maintains the identity of the edited object, encompassing tasks such as object addition, replacement, and deletion. By conducting phased training on FreeEdit followed by quality tuning, FreeEdit achieves high-quality zero-shot editing through convenient language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of FreeEdit across multiple task types, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods."

Achieving this is challenging due to the need for fine-grained alignment and creative ideation. To address this, we present SceneLoom, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-powered system that facilitates the coordination of data visualization with real-world imagery based on narrative intents. Through a formative study, we investigated the design space of coordination relationships between data visualization and real-world scenes from the perspectives of visual alignment and semantic coherence. Guided by the derived design considerations, SceneLoom leverages VLMs to extract visual and semantic features from scene images and data visualization, and perform design mapping through a reasoning process that incorporates spatial organization, shape similarity, layout consistency, and semantic binding. The system generates a set of contextually expressive, image-driven design alternatives that achieve coherent alignments across visual, semantic, and data dimensions. Users can explore these alternatives, select preferred mappings, and further refine the design through interactive adjustments and animated transitions to support expressive data communication. A user study and an example gallery validate SceneLoom's effectiveness in inspiring creative design and facilitating design externalization."

MADGuard addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1) It constructs a native provenance graph by integrating multisource services and multidimensional data, employing feature hashing and positional encoding for efficient graph representation; (2) The system introduces a Temporal Graph Network (TGN) model combined with edge reconstruction error and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) weighting, achieving a 15. 07% improvement in the F1 score compared to existing methods; (3) For the first time in microservice security, an integrated forensic analysis module is implemented, allowing rapid anomaly path reconstruction through aggregated anomaly subgraphs. Comprehensive evaluations on typical microservice benchmarks (TeaStore, RobotShop, SockShop) demonstrate MADGuard’s superior performance: 94.08% detection accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining practical operational efficiency."

    "abstract": "The core challenge of steganalysislies in detecting extremely weak signals. While deeper networks improve accuracy, they exacerbate the risks of overfitting and poor generalization. The root cause is attention misalignment, where models inherently focus on semantic content rather than the texture rich regions containing steganographic signals. To address this, we propose a general and lightweight Attention Misalignment Correction (AttMC) mechanism. Leveraging the natural tendency of filter detection to focus on textural regions, our mechanism guides the model's attention via a knowledge-sharing strategy. Specifically, we design an auxiliary task of random block-wise filter detection to explicitly teach the model to prioritize textural areas. This texture-centric attention is then transferred to the main task through a shared network backbone. This process not only corrects the model's attention misalignment but also steers the decision boundary toward a more robust and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and play AttMC mechanism significantly improves the detection accuracy and generalization performance of existing models with a negligible increase in parameters."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, there has been growing demand for enhanced reliability and safety, leading to increased research focus on accurate fault diagnosis in UAV systems. However, existing fault diagnosis methods primarily rely on conventional multivariate time series models, which often fail to account for the unique characteristics of UAV data, such as limited data availability, varying sampling frequencies, sensor data loss caused by faults, and the inherent non-stationarity of flight data. To resolve these challenges, we propose an Unstable Transformer with Imbalanced Data Handling (UTIDH) framework for UAV multivariate time series fault diagnosis. To our knowledge, UTIDH is the first fault diagnosis method that considers the varying sampling frequencies of UAV sensor data. It employs a Multi-task Gaussian Process Imputation (MTGPI) to capture the correlations between UAV components, enabling alignment and supplementation of multivariate time-series data. Additionally, We design a novel Unstable Attention (US-Attention) mechanism to adaptively model the non-stationary characteristics of UAV data, thereby enhancing the detection of genuine fault patterns. To address the issue of limited data for fixed-wing UAVs, we have created and released the first-ever fixed-wing UAV simulation dataset (FUSD), which contains 1104 UAV simulation flight records, with 228 features across 4 flight states, with validity confirmed through transfer learning experiments bridging simulation and real-world flight data. Extensive evaluations on two UAV datasets demonstrate that UTIDH achieves state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series fault diagnosis for UAVs. Compared to baseline methods, UTIDH improves classification accuracy by 17.79% and detection accuracy by 4.49% on the FUSD dataset. On the publicly available ALFA dataset, it enhances classification accuracy by 8.34% and detection accuracy by 8.33%."

As AI expands beyond cloud computing to resource-constrained environments, TinyML offers promising solutions for latency-sensitive, bandwidth-efficient, and privacy-preserving applications. This paper presents a Systematic review of state-of-the-art TinyML applications across three critical domains: healthcare, education, and transportation. By analyzing 136 peer-reviewed publications from 2020 to 2025, we identify key trends, representative use cases, and the enabling technologies that support domain-specific deployments. Our review evaluates software frameworks, hardware platforms, model optimization techniques (e.g., quantization, pruning, and neural architecture search), and real-world deployment challenges such as energy consumption, memory limitations, and explainability. We further synthesize the metrics used to assess TinyML systems and highlight open research questions. Unlike previous surveys, our domain-centric approach offers a deeper contextual analysis of how TinyML is being adapted to solve real-world problems across diverse sectors. We conclude by outlining future directions and practical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in designing scalable, resilient, and ethically grounded TinyML systems."

    "abstract": "Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept drift as a Markov chain and introduce the Stationary Generalization Error to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting concept drift in FL."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), mobile edge computing (MEC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to the emergence of edge AI as a new communication paradigm. Edge learning (EL), a core component of edge AI, faces significant challenges due to limited computational and communication resources, particularly in the data-sharing mode. To address these two issues, this paper introduces the multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and hybrid orthogonal frequency division multiple access-nonorthogonal multiple access (OFDMA-NOMA) technologies into the EL system, resulting in a new system, namely, the multi-UAV and hybrid OFDMA-NOMA-enabled EL system. In the proposed system, each UAV is equipped with an edge-learning server to collect data from Internet of Things devices (IoTDs) and accomplish its respective learning task. The system aims to maximize the minimum F-measure — an effective metric for evaluating learning model performance — across all tasks by jointly optimizing IoTD transmit power, UAV working times, UAV three-dimensional placement, and the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) decoding order. In order to solve this intricate nonconvex problem, this paper decomposes it into four subproblems and solves them iteratively using an alternating optimization (AO) framework until converged results are obtained. The successive convex approximation (SCA) and grid search techniques are also employed in this process. The simulation results show the proposed scheme's convergence and reveal its superior performance against several other benchmark schemes."

This paradigm shift requires innovative technical solutions and fundamentally different approaches for vehicle design. Together, these developments introduce substantial challenges for an entire industry, affecting both development processes and operations. Although SDVs have attracted considerable attention and widespread industry involvement, prior research has primarily emphasized systematic literature reviews identifying emerging academic trends. Consequently, little attention has been paid to industry and economic developments that influence how SDV technologies evolve in practice and are crucial for future advancement. In response, this paper provides a different, industry-oriented view of the current trends and associated challenges of SDVs. To achieve this, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the SDV from an industry-based perspective. We analyzed three sources of information to identify the current trends in SDV development: expert interviews with automotive IT specialists, a study on major automotive trade fairs and workshops, and insights gained from the authors' professional experience. Based upon, we derive specific challenges arising from these trends. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of the present SDV landscape, trends and challenges, and serve as a foundation for future research efforts in this rapidly evolving field."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a real-time localization framework based on multi-sensor fusion for the autonomous navigation of mobile robots in challenging off-road environments. The proposed framework employs a hybrid coupling strategy at its front-end, which integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and LiDAR. As a consequence, GNSS Inertial Odometry (GIO) and Lidar Inertial Odometry (LIO) are created and these are crucial for achieving precise localization in real-time. The RGB-Height-Intensity descriptor is used to improve the precision of loop closure detection while maintaining search efficiency. This is achieved by integrating surface reflectance data from the LiDAR intensity channel and RGB data from camera images. Finally, in the back-end procedure of this framework, the accuracy of posture estimation is enhanced by the optimization of odometry and loop closure factors. Additionally, a framework of real-time localization and autonomous navigation is developed and implemented on a wheeled robot to verify the proposed real-time localization framework. The experimental results indicate the framework exhibited higher performance in off-road environments, where conventional localization techniques generally degrade."

The CZT detectors, with Depth of Interaction (DOI) capabilities, deliver an exceptional energy performance across a wide energy range up to 600 keV. The novel dual-FOV aperture system allows selective imaging with two configurations: a 28-cm diameter wide FOV suitable for dual-leg or scout imaging and a 16-cm diameter high-resolution, and high-sensitivity (HR-HS) FOV designed for single-leg or focused imaging. Utilizing uniform phantoms, resolution phantoms, and multi-tracer phantoms, we experimentally assessed the system’s sensitivity, spatial resolution, and multi-tracer imaging capabilities. Spatial resolutions were approximately 6 mm in HR-HS-FOV mode and between 8 mm to 10 mm in wide-FOV mode. Peak-to-Valley ratios, indicative of image clarity, improved with enhanced DOI resolutions, rising from 1.03 to 1.22. The system’s ability to perform multi-tracer imaging, essential for deriving multifunctional molecular information, further highlights its potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy for PVD."

    "abstract": "Digital Surface Models (DSMs) extracted from multi-view satellite images have extensive applications in the filed of photogrammetry. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has shown significant potential in 3D reconstruction, most existing NeRF methods for satellite scenes adopt an end-to-end single-branch network structure, making it difficult to achieve fine-grained modeling of multiple complex terrain simultaneously, and performs poorly in weak-texture regions. Meanwhile, deep MLP structures are prone to information degradation during feature transmission, further affecting the completeness and accuracy of DSMs. To address these challenges, we propose RDS-NeRF, a novel NeRF framework integrating residual feature enhancement and depth supervision. The method introduces a residual feature enhancement structure to alleviate the problem of information degradation during feature transmission in the network and improve the model’s ability to model local details and low-texture regions. Additionally, estimated depth maps are incorporated as global geometric priors to guide the network in constructing more accurate and complete 3D structures. Experiments on the WorldView-3 satellite imagery datasets across multiple typical land cover types (building, road, water body, and vegetation) and complex scenes integrating multiple land features demonstrate that RDS-NeRF outperforms mainstream methods in terms of DSM accuracy, completeness, and novel view synthesis quality. Ablation experiments further validate the complementarity and effectiveness of the residual enhancement and depth supervision mechanisms across different scene types. In conclusion, RDS-NeRF provides a new and effective solution for generating high-quality DSMs from satellite imagery with adaptability to multiple scenes.

Traditionally many researchers has designed and implemented their solution on leveraging machine learning and deep learning architectures to identify and classify the illegal practices in digital terms of services between the user and platforms. Despite of many advantages, those models suffers to handle to evolving and complex legal aspects in the digital terms of services. In order to mitigate those challenges, a new deep learning architecture is designed and it is entitled as multi attention convolution neural network towards automatic detection and classification of the evolving complex non- compliance practices of digital terms of services of digital platforms. Initially dataset pre-processing is performed out using stop word removal, stemming, Tokenization and Token Weighting –Term Frequency. Weighted Token is organized as feature vector were employed to the Multiattention Convolution Neural Network. Convolution layer of the model processes feature vector using kernel function to extract the semantic and contextual features with respect to legal aspect and generates the feature map. Those contextual features were processed in max pooling layer of the model with attention mechanism to capture of the significant conceptual and semantic features to be get organized in form of the feature map. Attention coefficient of the attention mechanism calculates the weight of the feature on multiple aspects. Finally significant conceptual and semantic features in form of feature map is processed in activation layer to linearize the feature map and those linearized feature map is applied to softmax function composed of random forest classifier to detect and classify the evolving and complex non compliances terms of services along loss function utilizing cross entropy model to eliminate the over fitting and underfitting issues. Extensive experimental analysis of the proposed model using TOS dataset in python environment proves that model is high efficient in detecting evolving and complex non-compliance TOS statements and performance model of the proposed model against conventional model using confusion matrix to test data proves its increased accuracy of 98.7% and efficiency against evolving TOS."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is a complex neurological disease occurs in brain which causes memory impairment and cognitive challenges. According of wealth health organization (WHO), it is considered as chronic disease as slowly degrade the brain function and it predominately affects the memory and thinking skills of the patients. Further it leads to loss of brain tissues on formation of amyloid plague and aberrant protein deposit which is considered as abnormal protein. Thus it requires special attention to discover the Alzheimer disease in early stages to reduce the oxidative damages. Those information causes continuous decline of cognitive function over time. In particular, many researchers have initiated early diagnosis methods of the Alzheimer diseases using Structured Magnetic Resonance Imaging to observe the structures and its cognitive function in the hippocampus regions of the brain. However those approaches fail to discover amyloid plague deposition as it helps to determine the stage of the disease accurately. In this paper, a yolov10 model has been employed to graph convolution network to consider the deposition of the aberrant protein and amyloid plague in the hippocampus regions of the brain which categories the stage of the Alzheimer disease. Initially preprocessing step is employed to enhance the contrast of image and to eliminate the noise and non-brain tissues like skull on the MRI slices. Those preprocessed image is applied to the Yolov10 model for segmentation of the disease region with bounding box representation. Bounding box of the disease region indicates the aberrant protein and amyloid plague deposits. Those segmented region is projected to the graph convolution network. In this architecture, segmented region is transformed into graph structure with node representing pixels and edges mentioning associations. Transformed graph data is processed using adjacency matrix in the convolution layer of the network to extract the features and establish a non-linear graph embedding. Further grapy pooling layer of the model process the non-linear graph embedded features to produce the linear high level graph features. Finally fully connected layer utilizes the softmax function to classify the linear graph embedded feature into diseases classes of Alzheimer disease into stages as Mild Cognitive Impairment, Moderate Cognitive Impairment and Severe Cognitive Impairment. Experimental analysis and performance analysis of the graph convolution network architecture is performed using structured magnetic resonance images acquired from GRAD dataset in the python environment. Model produces the 99.1% accuracy in multiple disease stages and it proved to be outperforming compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "A smart contract is a special type of transaction designed for the execution of automated logic on blockchains. Alas, smart contracts transactions are one of the major hindrances to blockchain throughput. Hence, improving the execution time of smart contracts is a prime challenge for Blockchains at large. To that end, concurrent execution of smart contract is an appealing direction, which has been adopted by several contemporary Blockchains like Solana, Aptos, Sui, Sei, and Monad. Executing smart contracts in parallel requires applying deterministic concurrency controls based on ensuring consistent ordering of all conflicting transactions in all miners/validators. Existing implementations rely on the Block's total ordering to resolve this requirement. Recently, it has been suggested that relying on minimal coloring of the conflict graph corresponding to the Block's transactions can provide a better performance potential, yet without any evaluation. In this paper, we compare between approaches to smart contracts parallelization. Our study’ finds that in many situations, indeed the coloring-based ordering leads to significantly better performance than the Block order preserving approach. However, this gain has its limits, and it is not always guaranteed. In particular, the results are largely dependent on the conflict ratio in the conflict graph and the type of application."

    "abstract": "In Peru, 9,856 hectares of potato crops were lost between planting and harvesting during the 2022/2023 agricultural season. This highlights the limited monitoring that occurs through traditional, labor-intensive methodologies that require significant human resources (surveyors), time (transportation), and financial resources (logistics) for conducting in situ agricultural surveys. Consequently, agricultural observation reports are restricted by the lengthy timelines associated with traditional methodologies, which impairs real-time monitoring capacity. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a machine learning classification model capable of detecting potato crops in advanced vegetation stages using Sentinel-2 spectral imagery. The study involved building an agricultural area dataset using georeferenced polygons. These polygons were subsequently used to compile a gallery of Sentinel-2 spectral images for the 2022/2023 season. Pixel processing methods were applied through spectral bands to filter out cloud cover, and vegetation indices were calculated as supplementary attributes. Finally, positive (potato crops) and negative (other crops and agricultural areas) classes were created to train the XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models. The best-trained model was SVM with an F1-score of 0.85, demonstrating its robust ability to distinguish potato crop vegetation from other agricultural areas. This study represents an initial step toward the detection of georeferenced crops in Peru, aiming to establish a foundation for future research on plot-level productivity assessment and the formulation of precise agricultural policies to strengthen national production."

Organizations rely on operational processes that structure and streamline internal activities, enhancing both productivity and performance. Currently, innovation and automation contribute to reducing errors, optimizing resource use, and ensuring quality in the delivery of products and services. This study analyzes the application of technologies, automation, and commercial and distribution processes, all of which are essential for managing sales operations and ensuring efficient product delivery. To assess the level of automation within organizations, an initial instrument comprising 40 questions was applied. However, it yielded a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.764, leading to its rejection due to insufficient reliability. Following a literature review, relevant technologies and tools used in organizational, commercial, and distribution processes were identified. Based on this analysis, a new instrument was developed, consisting of 32 questions and 172 items. This revised instrument underwent expert validation and achieved a reliability coefficient of 0.862, indicating high internal consistency. The instrument's applicability was tested through a pilot study involving 35 footwear companies located in Ambato, Ecuador. The results reveal that, although the use of technology demonstrates a positive correlation with customer growth (0.242), the influence remains modest. Moreover, the automation of commercial and distribution processes does not exhibit a statistically significant relationship with customer growth. These findings suggest that digitalization efforts alone are not sufficient to drive business expansion. Instead, they must be complemented by more effective marketing and commercialization strategies to fully capitalize on the potential of digital tools and automation."

Content-based filtering stands as the main component in the proposed recommendation system because it uses music tracks' fundamental features to build personalized recommendations. Tests and user surveys confirmed that the system fulfilled its objectives by raising access for minority artists along with maintaining user contentment ratings.

Therefore, this study aims to improve the well-being of children through a multivitamin product by applying methodologies such as Design Thinking, Lean Startup, and Scrum. These approaches allow for strategic focus by understanding the user's needs and problems, and by developing an innovative and impactful solution. As a result, a business model was created that includes nutrients which help reduce symptoms in neurodivergent children."

    "abstract": "The growing disinterest of engineering stu-dents in control theory and robotics, combined with the gap between theory and practice in traditional teaching methods, motivated the creation of an innovative approach by the IEEE RAS student chapter at the University of Brasilia. The goal was to develop and imple-ment a practical STEM-based methodology integrating teaching, research, and outreach through the use of real, accessible robotic platforms. The methodology was applied in four distinct projects-VSSS, EVAIMARIA, Edubot, and UnBeatables-involving undergraduate and graduate students in activities such as prototype con-struction, participation in robotics competitions, and scientific production. As a result, there was a significant increase in student engagement, membership growth, the publication of seven papers at IEEE international conferences, and the development of low-cost educational robots with high replicability potential. The implemented methodology proved effective in promoting interest in the field and can be adapted by other institutions, contributing significantly to strengthening engineering education and training new researchers."

Agile Business Intelligence (Agile BI) fills this gap by combining Agile principles with BI practices, allowing organizations to react promptly to changing market conditions. This paper discusses the ideas, advantages, disadvantages, and facilitating technologies of Agile BI, based on real-world implementations in industries like retail, finance, and healthcare. It illustrates how Agile BI enables proactive, data-driven decision-making and ongoing improvement. Two case studies show its effect: a multinational FMCG company turned around falling regional sales with fortnightly sprints and iterative dashboards, gaining an 18% increase in sales and a 75% decrease in reporting latency. A healthcare startup applied Agile BI throughout the pandemic to refresh hospital resource dashboards in real time, reducing patient admission delays by 40%. These examples highlight the potential of Agile BI to provide real-world benefits using adaptive planning and interactive analytics."

In the medical field, numerous hospitals have been collecting and accumulating accident information to prevent medical accidents and their recurrence. However, owing to the large volume of collected information, it is difficult to say that safety management personnel are making sufficient use of it. This study aims to develop a system that allows reporters to easily utilize accumulated previous cases when creating incident and accident reports. The past cases used in this system are a large-scale medical accident database created based on the Japan Council for Quality Health Care's medical accident database, and a hospital's own database. Using these two databases, incidents and accidents can be compared to determine if they are unique, new, or similar, aiding in improvement measures. As a deep learning model, we implemented our own Near-Miss BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), confirming the contextual advantage of BERT. This paper presents an overview of this system, the advantages of using these databases, and the evaluation results and their analysis."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the automotive industry due to their potential to enhance safety, efficiency, and user experience. Nevertheless, building reliable systems remains challenging because of the complexity of neural models, long training times, and difficulties in generalization. Mini Autonomous Cars (MACs) provide a practical and cost-effective testbed, enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation of learning-based driving algorithms in scaled-down environments. In this work, we present a methodology for MAC autonomous driving based on RGB-D data and Three-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNNs), evaluated against Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in two simulated tracks with distinct levels of complexity. Each model was trained and tested over 30 autonomous laps and assessed by lap time, variability, and track deviations. The results indicate that a reduced 3D-CNN architecture delivers the best performance on the visually complex Mini Monaco track, whereas a GRU-based RNN achieved the fastest times on the simpler Generated track. To further analyze robustness, we conducted an ablation study on the 3D-CNN. Interestingly, the version with fewer convolutional layers outperformed deeper variants, highlighting that reduced complexity can improve stability and generalization in challenging environments. These findings provide practical insights for selecting neural architectures in embedded implementations, balancing performance, robustness, and computational cost.

    "abstract": "The meteoric rise of e-commerce has brought unparalleled convenience to consumers but also opened the floodgates to sophisticated fraud schemes. In this rapidly evolving digital marketplace, traditional fraud detection methods often fall short. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has stepped in as a game-changer, yet its \"black-box\" nature leaves critical questions unanswered: Why did the AI flag this transaction as fraudulent? Can we trust its decision? This is where Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) emerges as a beacon of clarity. This paper embarks on a theoretical journey into the role of XAI in e-commerce fraud detection, examining Its potential to transform the way fraud is detected and mitigated. We explore leading-edge techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), unravelling how they transform opaque models into transparent decision-making allies. Beyond just theory, we analyse the real-world integration of XAI, emphasizing its ability to enhance user trust while preserving the high accuracy demanded by e-commerce platforms. However, the road to adopting XAI is not without hurdles. From computational complexities to ethical dilemmas surrounding fairness and bias, and the challenge of making explanations accessible to non-experts, the journey is complex. Looking ahead, we chart a future where XAI becomes indispensable— powered by innovations in hybrid modelling, ethical AI frameworks, and collaborative development across industries. Through this exploration, we illuminate XAI’s profound promise: a future where fraud detection is not only intelligent but also transparent, fair, and deeply human-centric."

The system integrates a robotic arm mounted on a linear rail, a custom-designed gripper for sample tube and Petri dish handling, and an automated pipetting module. The entire process is enclosed within a Class II biosafety cabinet. 3D models of the mechanical components were developed and analyzed with a finite element analysis software to ensure structural integrity under operational loads. The control system, based on a PLC architecture, coordinates the interaction between subsystems and provides a user-friendly interface via an HMI. Preliminary simulations confirm the system's operational feasibility, indicating a significant reduction in biohazard risk and an increase in process repeatability.

Using admission and academic records from 4,534 students at Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University (2017–2019), we constructed supervised learning models that control for instructor grading bias by engineering bias-resilient performance indicators. A broad set of classification and regression algorithms was benchmarked under 8-fold cross-validation, and feature importance analyses were applied to extract interpretable academic patterns. Results confirm that entrance exams, when evaluated through bias-controlled models, exhibit strong predictive capacity, with the overall entrance test score consistently emerging as the most influential feature. Subject-specific importance varied systematically by academic discipline, reinforcing the validity of track-specific cognitive profiles. This framework demonstrates how machine learning methods can enhance the fairness, validity, and analytical depth of entrance exam evaluations, offering a scalable and interpretable methodology for data-driven admission process improvement."

    "abstract": "Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors have garnered significant interest in humidity sensor filed due to the excellent advantages of nanogram-level theoretical mass resolution and digital frequency output, etc. However, a key limitation is the substantial energy dissipation in high humidity detection, which results in a low quality-factor (Q-factor), thereby restricting sensitivity and measurement accuracy. To address this issue, we developed a high-Q humidity sensor utilizing a liquid damping isolation strategy. In this design, the graphene oxide (GO) humidity-sensitive layer is supported and isolated by hydrophobic SiO₂ spheres, forming a SiO₂/GO bilayer structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the SiO₂/GO bilayer QCM humidity sensor achieves a high Q value of 66,084 at 97% RH, which is three times greater than that of the pure GO QCM sensor and surpasses previously reported values, demonstrating the excellent stability and the effectiveness of the proposed liquid damping isolation strategy for fabricating a high Q-factor QCM humidity sensor. In addition, the SiO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>/GO bilayer structure QCM humidity sensor suggested an ultrafast recovery time (＜1 s), good short-term and long-term stability. Based on the outstanding high humidity resistance, the sensor was applied for stable human breath monitoring. This work not only provides a novel idea and valuable reference for high performance QCM sensor fabrication, but also provides a reliable way for human health monitoring based on QCM humidity sensors."

This paper introduces a physics-informed neural network (PINN) dynamics model architecture that integrates a physics-based dynamics model into the neural network training process. The PINN optimizes all physical dynamics parameters, enforces the physical constraint to ensure parameter validity, and enhances model interpretability and fidelity. Furthermore, the PINN dynamics model is more practical by using accurately measurable wheel speed as inputs instead of torque through the coupled slip tire model. On this basis, a novel NMPC algorithm for trajectory tracking is proposed, which optimally balances the prediction horizon and distance by integrating the short and long horizons to ensure the tracking performance while considering the real-time computational efficiency. Finally, the real-vehicle experiment is conducted on a distributed drive electric vehicle (DDEV) to verify the algorithm's effectiveness with good real-time performance. The PINN dynamics model exhibits superior accuracy to the physics-based dynamics model, significantly enhancing the NMPC trajectory tracking capabilities."

First, improvements were made to the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) algorithm, which are essential for Moiré signals reconstruction method. Based on these enhanced algorithms, the Moiré signals reconstruction process was developed to improve signal quality, and the arctangent subdivision method was employed to subdivide the Moiré signals. Finally, the effectiveness of the Moiré signal reconstruction method was verified through a built performance test platform for linear displacement sensors, and the accuracy of the linear displacement sensors was tested. Experimental results show that the subdivision errors before and after Moiré signals reconstruction are 1.985 rad and 0.157 rad, respectively. The system's measurement accuracy is within 1 μm, and both repeatability and reproducibility errors are less than 0.6 μm."

Here we present a transformative, user-driven land cover change prediction tool designed to aid land planners in strategic decision-making for conservation and habitat protection. Within an integrated map-based prediction pipeline, the tool uses machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to classify satellite images and make predictions of near-term land cover changes. The tool facilitates user interaction with a cloud-hosted ML model, making it accessible to non-technical users for generating map-based predictions using big data. The tool’s key strength lies in its dynamic variable adjustment feature, empowering users to tailor scenarios related to potential future development planning. Through the integration of cloud-hosted ML and DL models with a user-centric interface, the tool has the potential to allow stakeholders and land planners to make informed decisions, actively minimizing habitat destruction and aligning with broader conservation objectives. We tested our approach in the context of central Texas, USA to evaluate its effectiveness in diverse conservation scenarios, with an average overall accuracy of 88% for the land cover class maps over four years and over 72% for the 5-year land cover change prediction. While our approach has the potential to improve land management and planning for conservation, we also acknowledge the importance of rigorous model validation and ongoing refinement and highlight the need for technological advancement to be developed with strong stakeholder engagement."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a dependency-aware task scheduling problem in connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) networks. Specifically, each CAV task consists of multiple dependent subtasks, which can be distributed to nearby vehicles or roadside unit for processing. Since frequent subtasks scheduling may increase communication overhead, a scheduling scheme that simplifies task dependencies is designed, incorporating a subtask merging mechanism to reduce the complexity of dependent task scheduling. We formulate a long-term joint subtask scheduling and resource allocation optimization problem to minimize the average tasks completion delay while guaranteeing system stability. Therefore, Lyapunov optimization is utilized to decouple the long-term problem as a multiple instantaneous deterministic problem. To capture the dynamics of vehicular environment and randomness of task arrivals, the problem is reformulated as a parameterized action Markov decision process. To overcome the issue that inefficient exploration of single-step deterministic policies in sparse reward, we propose a novel diffusion-based hybrid proximal policy optimization algorithm, integrating the diffusion model with deep reinforcement learning. Instead of relying on the original policy network, diffusion policy is used to generate continuous actions, which aims to improve the expressiveness of the policy in capturing multimodal action distributions and enhancing decision-making over long horizons through multi-step refinement. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce task completion delay by 6.9%–12.1% compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks."

In this work, we present a location-aware deep learning framework for HAR, tailored to the four most common smartphone carrying positions among elderly users: hand, thigh pocket, belly pouch, and shoulder bag. A novel dataset was collected from fourteen elderly participants in South Korea, encompassing fifteen ADLs and fall-like activities across these carrying positions. Raw inertial signals were transformed into spectrograms via short-time Fourier transform, enabling the application of advanced deep learning models, including convolutional neural network, EfficientNet-B0, and vision transformers. Synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied to mitigate class imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientNet-B0 consistently achieves the highest classification performance, reaching 99% accuracy across multiple positions, and outperforming conventional architectures on both our dataset and the public HARTH dataset. The proposed framework highlights the importance of location-aware modeling and provides a scalable pathway toward robust, real-world HAR systems for elderly populations."

    "abstract": "Meditation offers numerous benefits, including stress reduction and enhanced attention. A common technique for beginners is slow breathing, often supported by biofeedback systems that use sensors to collect physiological signals and provide feedback, enabling users to regulate their physiological states. In this work, we developed an audio-based biofeedback system that is easy to set up, portable, and cost-effective. Our system consists of a smartphone, a microcontroller, and a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, and employs a breathing state classifier that dynamically adjusts the frequency region of interest to enable accurate respiratory rate estimation during slow breathing (3–6 bpm). When the user slows their breathing to the desired threshold, the app generates audio feedback. Our results indicate that the experimental group achieved a slower respiratory rate compared to the control group and felt relaxed yet alert. Additionally, the experimental group demonstrated better control over their breathing, and questionnaire responses revealed more positive experiences than those of the control group."

The three-phase interleaving topology is considered for three different converters: an interleaving boost converter, an interleaving four-switch single-inductor buck-boost converter, and an interleaving buck converter. MPPT and droop-based control are recommended for maximum power extraction from the PV system and regulation of the DC bus voltage. A cascaded hybrid nonlinear controller is developed for current and voltage control, merging the advantages of both linear and nonlinear control theory. The design ensures an uninterrupted power supply to the electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The algorithm is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and validated through rapid control prototyping using a TI C2000 microcontroller and a Typhoon 404 device for real-time results. Moreover, a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art control structures is also presented to show the efficiency of the proposed controller. The simulation results, comparative analysis, and hardware results under different conditions confirm the adaptability of the proposed control algorithms for real applications."

The proposed scheme employs a dual-mode, switched operational amplifier-based circuit that generates an output using the thermistor and a pair of linearizing resistors. The proposed setup intelligently controls the individual mode outputs based on the duty cycle of the control pulse. Additionally, the design incorporates a low-pass filter (LPF) to provide a weighted average of the dual-mode outputs. It has been shown that the LPF output possesses a linear dependence on the input temperature. To achieve best performance of the aforesaid duty-ratio based thermistor linearizer (DTL), a constrained parameter optimization problem is formulated with the non-linearity as an objective function. The duty-ratio and other circuit parameters of the DTL are optimized with the help of a differential evolution algorithm. The proposed linearizer circuit provides better output linearity over a broad temperature span than prior art. The letter then proceeds to the performance studies of DTL. Hardware studies are carried out using synthesized thermistors and actual thermistors in a climatic chamber.

However, challenges like extreme angles and continuous camera motion require adaptive modeling of complex temporal relationships. To tackle these challenges, we leverage an image-language model as the vision encoder and introduce a temporal adaptation module that combines convolution with self-attention layers to both capture local semantics across neighboring frames and model global temporal dependencies. This design allows our model to exploit the multimodal knowledge of the vision encoder while effectively reasoning over the spatiotemporal dynamics. In addition, privacy concerns often restrict access to annotated aerial datasets, posing further challenges for model training. To address this, we develop a federated learning (FL) framework that enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients. Within this framework, we establish a unified benchmark for systematic comparison of temporal adapters, text decoders, and FL strategies, hence filling a gap in existing literature. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of our approach and its potential for advancing aerial VC."

    "abstract": "With the recent proliferation in penetration levels of converter-based grid-connected wind turbine systems (WTSs), a decrease in grid strength has been observed. In pursuit of improving grid strength and power quality, the newly proposed slip-synchronous wind turbine system (SS-WTS) is employed, whereby a synchronous generator (SG) is directly connected to the grid and damping is provided through the use of a slip permanent magnet coupling (S-PMC). However, the proper operation of the turbine drivetrain has yet to be fully investigated under transient loading conditions. This paper examines various drivetrain topologies to ensure the optimal placement of the S-PMC for stability and load mitigation. From the stability analysis, various S-PMC slip ranges, SG synchronous reactance values and inertia ratios between the turbine hub and SG rotor were evaluated. This led to more thorough design criteria being established to ensure the proper stability of the SS-WTS under transient conditions, with specific regard to low-voltage ride-throughs (LVRTs). This paper found that, although connecting the SS-WTS to the grid is a feasible solution to improve grid strength, instability is observed under certain transient conditions, such as LVRTs. It was noted that direct-drive SS-WTSs are less susceptible to transient instability, as they possess a far larger inertia ratio between the wind turbine and the SG rotor. This paper found the optimal slip and synchronous reactance for all SS-WTS variants, where stability under all transient conditions is dependent on the turbine's rated torque, the turbine's inertia and the SG inertia. This made it possible to formulate adequate design criteria based on the application and capability needs of the SS-WTS."

We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the random angular location parameters of a point target, whose prior distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to investigate the potential of leveraging prior information from two distinct perspectives, thereby providing deeper insights into the estimation process, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar transmit beampattern design problems and propose corresponding low-complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance."

    "abstract": "Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios."

    "abstract": "The research tackles key challenges for improving the discovery of large-scale visual collections within the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain, particularly in museums and archives. Its contribution is a multimodal content understanding approach designed for image collections that lack relevant metadata, hindering effective discovery. The proposed method utilises AI-assisted image classification and unified vision-language understanding, combining visual features with semantic context to generate rich and meaningful metadata. The proposed approach enables experts to enrich and visualise large-scale datasets of image collections by assigning both expert and non-expert labels, aligning with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Thus, the novel workflow broadens access to this visual material for diverse audiences through search and browse interfaces in a web browser. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the previously unclassified Design Archives’ glass plate negatives dataset, which consists of approximately ∼10,000 digitised images depicting 20th-century historical designs. Through an AI workflow, the dataset is enriched with expert and non-expert information. Users can search and browse results using 2D and 3D visualisations, as well as text-based search. The research also explores the advantages and current limitations of the proposed visualisation approach in creating more meaningful search and browsing functionalities for large-scale CH collections. The results demonstrate that while 3D visualisations offer more affordances than their 2D counterpart, users require further support to interact with the large-scale datasets meaningfully. Hence, there is a need for discovery interfaces that support interactivity, visual cues, and text-based search to enhance the users’ discovery journey."

In line with this, the present study puts forth an automatic framework for liver lesion segmentation using DenseNet architecture as a benchmark for medical imaging research in the LITS dataset. We have built up a way of densely connected convolutional neural networks (DenseNet) because of its feature reuse as well as efficiency in learning hierarchical representations to derive strong results in segmentation accuracy. One engages in a comprehensive preprocessing of data to cover image resizing, mask segmentation, and augmentation to better generalization of the models. Also, a hybrid loss function was used: the combination of Binary Crossentropy and Dice Coefficient to optimize the DenseNet model for the objective of pixel-level accuracy on segmentation tasks. The data is split into training and validation sections to evaluate how well it performs with data previously unseen. An application built on Flask supports the deployment of the trained model enabling users to upload 3D liver CT scans and visualize the segmentation results through an interactive interface. It receives the uploaded images in real-time, process them for inference based on the DenseNet model, then outputs the segmented images to encourage and assist clinical decision-making. The experimental results, however, show that the model is quite robust and effective in the accurate delineation of liver lesions with a very high level of performance in terms of dice similarity and precision. The addition of the user-friendly web interface promises to make the system invaluable to medical personnel. Thus, the ample potential in terms of using medical imaging and affecting thick workflow in diagnostics by deep learning techniques is revealed."

We constructed a dataset, designed the model architecture, and conducted training and performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms Long Short-Term Memory in prediction accuracy and meets engineering application requirements. The Transformer model uniquely leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in melt-pool dynamics, enabling robust nonlinear mapping of complex temporal patterns.

    "abstract": "Containers have become a critical component of cloud-native technologies, enabling organizations to run scalable and isolated workloads. However, in recent years there has been an increase in the sophistication of attacks targeting the cloud-native environment. It is crucial to implement security controls that protect containers at all stages of their lifecycle to mitigate risks such as privilege escalation by malicious applications. Numerous studies have aimed to develop security profiles for container applications that limit their privileges and protect the host system from compromise. Despite these efforts, the shared underlying kernel may still permit several successful attacks. In this study, we strive to develop a concise system call whitelist to address the problem of excessive privileges while ensuring the operational availability of applications. To achieve this, we propose to enhance static analysis with dynamic analysis to gather comprehensive information about the containerized application during two distinct execution phases: the initialization and the serving phases. Using this information, we determine the essential system calls for the application's operation and prevent all unwarranted system calls. We then perform crash analysis on the container under test to identify and incorporate any missing system calls. Through numerous experiments with popular server applications, we confirm that our approach is effective in discovering the necessary system calls for the operation of containerized applications. The system call whitelists produced by this method are more concise than Docker's default seccomp profile, consequently reducing the attack surface for a wide variety of applications and host systems significantly."

These particularly include compatibility to most established microtechnologies, but also barrier properties enabling its use as encapsulation layer. Additionally, some Parylene types are classified to be biocompatible according ISO 10993, so that they can be used for medical applications such as medical implants. The presented paper aims to investigate the biocompatibility of Parylene F, which is not certified to be biocompatible but of high interest for technical use due to its better thermal stability compared to the more common Parylene C. Furthermore, the literature reports the diffusion of toxic metal ions through Parylene C. With respect to the use of Parylene as a biocompatible encapsulation layer for medical implants, this paper investigates, whether Parylene C is suitable to encapsulate a cytotoxic copper layer and avoid diffusion, particularly for the combination of Parylene C with inorganic metal oxide layers to form an ultrabarrier. For both investigations, cytotoxicity tests according to ISO 10993–5 were performed. The results prove the same cell behavior of Parylene F compared to the biocompatible certified Parylene C as well as the suppression of the diffusion of toxic metal ions through Parylene C and Parylene based ultrabarriers."

Many recent works combine vision-based keypoint detection with learning-based motion generation, but they often rely on strong assumptions or large training datasets. Motivated by the need for reproducible dressing frameworks, this work proposes a modular framework for autonomously dressing t-shirts using a robotic manipulator, Robotic Dressing Gaussian Mixture Modeling (RD-GMM). The system integrates RGB-D perception for body keypoint detection, motion generation based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), which learn trajectories from a limited number of kinesthetic demonstrations, all managed by a state machine. The framework is experimentally validated on a physical mannequin using a Kinova Gen3 robot, demonstrating high system performance in dressing a t-shirt task with the inclusion of GMM. Despite the challenges of handling deformable objects and the assumption of a static human posture, the results show the feasibility of dressing a human with a single manipulator without the need for regrasping."

In this study, an artificial intelligencebased approach was implemented to classify hypertension risk into four categories: normal, prehypertension, hypertension stage 1, and hypertension stage 2. The methodology involved feature selection using an unsupervised learning approach, followed by dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB). Subsequently, we performed model training and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics. The results show that PCA identified nine principal components that explain 98.54 % of the variability without significant information loss.

    "abstract": "Human Monkeypox is a resurgent zoonotic disease which gathers more attention among patients and healthcare professional as it is less severe than small pox. Monkey disease emerges as primary orthopoxvirus with spreads to humans primarily through bite of infected animals like bat or monkey with symptoms includes muscle pain, fever, headache and fatigue. Disease can be also recognized by occurrence of swollen glands around ears, jaws and neck. Further it causes complications in severe cases like sepsis, Myocarditis, pneumonia and conjunctivitis. Thus, it becomes mandatory to detect monkey virus in early stages to avoid health complications in severe stages. Traditionally medical researcher has performed disease diagnosis using computer vision approaches using machine learning and deep learning architectures to detect and classify the monkey pox disease in early stages to quarantine the disease from development. Regardless of the several advantages of those approaches, those approaches incorporate prolonged procedure to combat those diseases as it is similar to other skin diseases. In order to mitigate those challenges, a new multiscale convolution neural network integrating long short term memory model is designed to segment, detect and classify disease in early stages. Initially Model training is performed using monkeypox skin lesion dataset. To increase recognition accuracy of the model, dataset is preprocessed using noise filtering, normalization and contrast enhancement approaches. Preprocessed dataset is projected to the Multiscale convolution neural network and long short term memory model. Model hyper parameter of the Multiscale convolution neural network layers has fine-tuned with optimal values and suitable functions. Parameterized model composed of several layer process preprocessed data to segment, feature extract and feature select. Feature vector and feature map is stored in the long short term memory model to capture dependency of the temporal features to spatial feature extracted in convolution layer. Finally dense layer of model uses activation function, softmax function and loss function to process spatial and temporal features towards feature aggregation in unified form and feature classification with respect to disease label. In this work, ReLu is incorporated as activation function, Naïve bayes classifier is applied as softmax function and cross entropy is employed to reduce overfitting and under fitting issues. Experimental analysis of the Integrated Multiscale convolution neural network with long short term memory model has performed using benchmark dataset represented as monkeypox skin lesion dataset as it contains ground truth data for various disease labels such as Macules, Papules, Vesicles and Pustules. In experimental analysis, proposed model exhibits better processing capabilities compared to the conventional approaches. Further performance analysis of the model is carried out using test data of the dataset through confusion matrix to compute the parameter for estimate model accuracy. While on performance analyses, it is proved that proposed model exhibits detection and classification accuracy of 98.8% which is considered to higher than conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) arrays outperform scalar sensor arrays (SSAs) in accuracy and resolution due to polarization diversity, but come with increased computational burden, particularly in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To address this challenge, this paper presents a tensor compressive sampling-driven higher-order propagator method (TCS-HOPM) for two-dimensional direction-of-arrival (2D-DOA) and polarization estimation in millimeter-wave (mmWave) polarized massive MIMO systems. To capture the multidimensional structure of the received data, the array measurement is first stacked into a third-order tensor. The TCS scheme is then integrated with the HOPM for subspace estimation, effectively avoiding the computationally-intensive large tensor and the associated higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). By leveraging the potential rotational invariance characteristics, the normalized electric and magnetic response vectors are estimated to perform a modified vector cross-product for 2D-DOA rough estimation. The reduced-dimension MUSIC (RDMUSIC) method is subsequently applied to find 2D-DOA and polarization exact estimation near the pre-obtained 2D-DOA rough estimation. Benefiting from the combination of TCS-HOPM and the rough-refined strategy, the presented estimator enables precise multidimensional parameter estimation with substantially reduced computational complexity, especially for polarized massive MIMO configurations. Furthermore, it allows the array geometry to be flexibly adapted to real-world platforms. Several simulations demonstrate that the presented framework outperforms existing methods."

    "abstract": "Accurate parameter estimation for DC-DC boost converters is essential for enabling their health monitoring, fault diagnosis and optimal control. However, under regular sampling configurations, DC-DC boost converters experience uncertain voltage transients at switching instants due to inherent sampling delays. The absence of such critical transient information makes high-precision multi-parameter estimation of boost converter heavily dependent on additional high-frequency measurement circuits. To solve this challenge, this paper proposes a Transient-Aware Physics-informed neural network (TA-PINN). By enhancing the conventional PINN framework with physics-guided, weakly-supervised mechanism, TA-PINN constrains the embedded system model to conform to both the sampled system dynamics and the physical laws governing the converter, including its discontinuous output voltage transients. As a result, TA-PINN alleviates the high reliance for additional high-speed measurement circuitry typically required by existing methods, and can achieve accurate parameter estimation using data sampling configurations compatible with commonly used microcontroller units (MCUs). The experimental results verify the performance of the proposed method."

This paper explores an optimized back-EMF method, which owns the capacity of commutation error self-correction. First, a back-EMF threshold comparison circuit is proposed for commutation signal acquisition, which can adjust the commutation phase by an offset voltage. Then, a hardware-based regulator is designed to provide an auto-adjusted offset voltage for achieving the accurate commutation. Compared to the conventional method, it can achieve the realtime corrected commutation automatically without using digital processor and overcome the sampling speed limitation due to using a hardware-based closed-loop regulation.

SFTM exploits blur characteristics to enhance motion feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Frequency-Domain Channel Attention (IFCA) module, which exploits both low- and high-frequency components to extract salient features.

    "abstract": "As a paradigm shift towards pervasive intelligence, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potentials to improve communication efficiency and provide user-centric services by delivering task-oriented semantic meanings. However, the exponential growth in connected devices, data volumes, and communication demands presents significant challenges for practical SemCom design, particularly in resource-constrained wireless networks. In this work, we propose a task-agnostic semantic communication (TASC) framework capable of supporting multimodal data across diverse tasks. To investigate the interplay between communication and intelligent tasks from an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce a distributed multimodal information bottleneck (DMIB) principle, which enables the extraction of minimal sufficient unimodal and multimodal representations by eliminating redundant information while preserving task-relevant semantics. To further reduce the communication overhead, we develop an adaptive semantic feature transmission method under dynamic channel conditions. Then, TASC is trained based on federated meta-learning (FML) to learn a well-initialized model for rapid adaptation and generalization. To gain deep insights, we conduct theoretical analysis and devise resource management to accelerate convergence while minimizing the training latency and energy cost. Moreover, we develop a joint user selection and resource allocation algorithm to address the non-convex problem with theoretical guarantees. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TASC compared to baselines."

    "abstract": "Accurate parameter estimation is crucial for ensuring reliable signal reception in modern wireless communication systems, particularly in non-cooperative or dynamically changing environments. However, practical receivers frequently encounter unknown symbol rates and carrier frequency offsets induced by oscillator mismatches and channel impairments, significantly degrading demodulation and synchronization performance. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes a dual-branch deep neural network designed to jointly estimate symbol rates and carrier frequency offsets directly from raw baseband waveforms. The proposed model employs hierarchical convolutional feature extraction combined with channel-wise attention mechanisms, effectively capturing temporal and spectral characteristics across diverse modulation formats. Additionally, a heteroscedastic loss function is introduced to enhance robustness under varying noise conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using a large-scale synthetic dataset comprising 240,000 signal samples, covering 12 modulation schemes and spanning a broad signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from 0 dB to 20 dB. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the mean absolute error in estimating both symbol rate and frequency offset compared to state-of-the-art CNN- and RNN-based baseline methods, particularly in low-to-moderate SNR regimes. These findings demonstrate that the developed approach provides an effective and practical solution for blind synchronization and parameter estimation tasks in complex wireless communication scenarios."

    "abstract": "London's famous \"tube map\" is an iconic piece of design and perhaps represents the schematic visualization style most well-known to the general public: its octolinearity has become the de facto standard for transit maps around the world. Making a good schematic transit map is challenging and labour-intensive, and has attracted the attention of the optimization community. Much of the literature has focused on mathematically defining an optimal drawing and algorithms to compute one. However, achieving these \"optimal\" layouts is computationally challenging, often requiring multiple minutes of runtime. Crucially, what it means for a map to be good is actually highly dependent on factors that evade a general formal definition, like unique landmarks within the network, the context in which a map will be displayed, and the preference of the designer and client. Rather than attempting to make an algorithm that produces a single high-quality and ready-to-use metro map at great cost, we propose it is more fruitful to support rapid layout iteration by a human designer, providing a workflow that enables efficient exploration of a wider range of designs than could be done by hand, and iterating on these designs. To this end we identify steps in the design process of schematic maps that are tedious to do by hand but are algorithmically feasible, and present a framework around a simple linear program that computes network layouts almost instantaneously given a fixed direction for every connection. These connection directions are decided by a designer in a graphical user interface with several interaction methods and a number of quality-of-life features demonstrating the flexibility of the framework; the implementation is available as open source."

    "abstract": "This article addresses the prescribed-time control of a direct current (DC) microgrid equipped with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising multiple storage batteries and supercapacitors. First, a novel droop control algorithm is proposed to mitigate constant power load (CPL) fluctuations and enable efficient power distribution among the energy storage components. Next, a prescribed-time extended state observer (PTESO) is developed to estimate the lumped perturbations, including both matched and mismatched components, arising from parameter uncertainties in capacitors and inductors of an HESS. Based on the PTESO, a prescribed-time control strategy is designed to guarantee that the dc microgrid bus voltage accurately tracks its reference value within a prescribed time, irrespective of system initial states. Finally, simulation cases under CPL fluctuations verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving the performance of a dc microgrid with an HESS."

    "abstract": "In the field of automated driving, scenario-based safety testing is essential for ensuring vehicle safety and promoting technological development. However, traditional mileage-based real-world testing methods are limited by the massive testing requirements and extremely long cycles, hardly meeting efficient validation demands. To address this, this paper proposes a Hybrid Optimal Acceleration Evaluation (HOAE) model based on virtual testing. First, a hybrid segmentation model based on fitting error is constructed to accurately characterize the distribution features of naturalistic driving data, and an acceleration model is designed with the number of tests as the optimization objective to solve for the optimal number of segments. Second, the Importance Sampling (IS) method is introduced to increase the occurrence probability of risk scenarios, and the optimal IS function is solved based on the above acceleration model. Finally, a simulation test platform is established, and comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted under various acceleration evaluation methods, indicators, and parameter distributions. The results demonstrate that the proposed HOAE method offers better universality and higher testing efficiency, and it can increase the test mileage to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> times of the Monte Carlo (MC) method, thereby advancing safety testing of automated vehicles toward greater efficiency and broader applicability."

    "abstract": "The textile industry plays a critical role in the global economy. In this context, small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) have shown notable growth, yet they continue to face significant operational challenges-particularly delays in order fulfillment. These delays are primarily attributed to recurrent machinery breakdowns and high rates of defective products. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated model that combines tools from Planned Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) with an Internet of Things (IoT)-based approach, along with Autonomous TPM to reduce failure frequency, and Standard Work to minimize variability and product defects. The implementation of this model aims to enhance machine availability and standardize production processes. The effectiveness of the model was measured using the Production Efficiency indicator, which improved significantly from 66.6% to 78.1 %. Beyond solving the specific challenges of the case study company, this work aims to serve as a replicable framework for addressing operational inefficiencies and improving delivery performance across the textile sector."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are vital for enabling real-time communication between cars, hence enhancing safety, traffic management as well as autonomous driving. With the development of sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, which offer ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), immense connection & high information throughput, VANETs' data-sharing skills have greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, there are significant privacy and safety concerns linked with the routine transmission of susceptible sensitive data in contexts including fast-moving vehicles. Traditional cryptographic methods are either ineffective or insufficient when applied to the limits of 6G virtual area networks (VANETs). To resolve this problem, the study suggests a way to share data safely & privately that relies on Private Set Intersection (PSI). This would allow cars to safely discover things that are similar in their data, like occurrences & dangers without providing information that isn't correlated. The approach integrates reward systems to encourage truthful data exchange with an adaptive feedback model to identify and detect harmful behavior. Additionally, the system employs cryptographic primitives that are well-suited to resource-constrained automotive contexts for data deduplication of data transactional validation as well as lightweight certification. The result of the proposed study shows that our method reduces the communication overhead by 38% as well as storage by 31% compared to other methods. The system ensures end-to-end latency remains under 80 Ms in environments with 1000 cars, while attaining a misinformation detection accuracy of 92% using Integrated trust scoring & voting mechanisms. These findings provide information on the scalability of the method, as well as its efficiency in real time and its strength in privacy. This research demonstrates that PSI, when integrated with incentive-aligned distribution and verification methods, provides a feasible option for safe & efficient data transmission in 6G VANETs."

Using a sequential explanatory mixed-method design, the analysis draws on patent data, peer-reviewed publications, and market reports to identify key drivers of disruption, notably the rise of plant-based and synthetic milk alternatives. The findings reveal a marked increase in research and development activities related to sustainability, nutritional enhancement, and production efficiency. The study also identifies emerging technologies with high potential for local adaptation and competitive advantage. Based on this evidence, a strategic action framework is proposed, integrating sustainability principles, innovation in processes and products, and alignment with public policy. The results underscore the relevance of technological surveillance as a decision-support tool for anticipating sectoral shifts and guiding adaptive strategies in response to global trends."

    "abstract": "Smart contracts manage valuable assets, and their immutability hinders bug fixing. Therefore, pre-deployment verification and validation are critical. In fact, auditing has become mandatory in the pipeline of smart contract development. Auditors usually combine manual inspection with automated tools in their auditing work, looking for issues that may be domain dependent (i.e., pertaining to the correct implementation of requirements-which are often informal, partial, and implicit) or independent (e.g., reentrancy, overflow, etc.), To identify domain dependent issues, it is important to understand the non-trivial behavior of the implementation over sequences of calls made by callees playing different roles in the contract. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines predicate abstraction with modal transition systems to build abstractions that can help auditors in the smart contract validation process. The required inputs are a set of predicates provided as code and, optionally, constraints over smart contract function parameters. The output is a modal transition system that captures the contract's behavior. We report on a prototype that builds modal abstractions and an evaluation on two established benchmarks where we identified four previously unreported issues."

Most recent research has focused on adapting models to the dynamic distribution of nonstationary data streams. However, continual learning is not only adaptation to concept drift: phenomena such as catastrophic forgetting, as well as forward and backward transfers, appear when new classification tasks are introduced in the data stream. This paper aims to develop a standardized and operational evaluation protocol specifically adapted to the study of these phenomena, in order to identify the most promising strategies for this new multi-label, multi-task learning problem on tabular data stream. This protocol, which is reproducible, fair, and flexible enough to allow the simulation of a large number of scenarios, includes the creation of multi-label and multi-task streams, and an evaluation protocol for measuring (a) online performance, (b) phenomena linked to continual learning and (c) resources consumed. It is tested to compare 18 continual multi-label classification strategies on 6 open literature datasets and 3 simulated datasets. This exploratory analysis has enabled us to identify the promising nature of neural networks coupled with data replay."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of an autonomous climbing robot aimed at the internal cleaning and inspection of rectangular ventilation ducts in healthcare facilities (like HVAC system). These ducts, often neglected due to inaccessibility and operational constraints, accumulate particulate matter and biological contaminants that can compromise indoor air quality and increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (nosocomial infections). Existing cleaning methods are labor-intensive, costly and require system shutdowns. The proposed robot integrates a magnetic adhesion system optimized for vertical surfaces guided by a LiDaR sensor for autonomous travel. A comparative analysis of various magnetic adhesion mechanisms informed the development of a hybrid design capable of adapting to duct curvature and irregularities. Preliminary tests demonstrated that each magnet exerts a magnetic force of 2.52N, and that a force of 29.43N is required to properly attach the system to the duct. This requires 12 magnets in constant contact for the system to function properly. This work offers a cost-effective, scalable, and minimally disruptive solution for duct sanitation in critical infrastructure, contributing to better air hygiene in high-risk healthcare environments."

Traditional itinerary generators mostly refer to the online reviews which may not meet our individual constraints. Having a personalized itinerary generator is more effective, because we mention our preferences, budget and also availability of time. When an itinerary is generated on user’s preferences, one can enjoy the trip to the fullest. This project uses a Hybrid model to present an itinerary generator. The system integrates content-based filtering for new users and collaborative filtering to deliver personalized recommendations achieving a balanced accuracy of 90-95% and it outperforms the K-means (60 -65 accuracy). A personalized itinerary generator is the best way to ensure a satisfying and seamless travel experience for users."

    "abstract": "Social media has evolved into a crucial source of data for analyzing opinions and social trends. However, the application of data extraction techniques to study public perception of forced migration remains an underexplored field. This study conducts a systematic literature review to identify the most commonly used methodologies for data extraction from social media to analyze public opinion on migration. A total of 35 selected articles were analyzed using a structured search process inspired by Kitchenham's methodology, with well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results indicate that official APIs have been the predominant method for data extraction, although Web Scraping has emerged as a complementary technique, enabling the extraction of data from platforms that do not provide open API access. These findings can support the development of data-driven strategies to monitor migration trends and inform public policies aimed at refugee integration."

While emerging technologies offer novel notification experiences, how effectively they perform when users are engaged in primary tasks remains unclear. This study examines the notification performance of a recently developed pneumatic soft curvature-changing smartwatch. Through an experimental investigation, we measured users’ absolute detection threshold (ADT) for notifications while they performed cognitive and physical tasks. Results show an ADT of 5.70 psi (round curvature) and 6.22 psi (pointy curvature) during a cognitive task and an ADT of 8.07 psi (round curvature) and 10 psi (pointy curvature) during a physical task. These findings provide valuable insights for designing future shape-changing notification smartwatches to improve user experience and enhance task compatibility."

NCLSTM designs hybrid gate and nonlinear compensation gate. The hybrid gate can avoid the gradient conflict by regulating the dynamic fusion ratio between the historical state and the current input. The nonlinear compensation gate explicitly integrates the generalized memory polynomial (GMP) into the NCLSTM unit, which enhances the ability of NCLSTM to capture high-order nonlinear features. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of NCLSTM is better than the existing prediction methods, and the best prediction accuracy can be obtained by adjusting the memory depth and nonlinear order in NCLSTM. The PIM cancellation system based on NCLSTM can effectively suppress PIM interference by 41 dB."

To address this, CAFNet is proposed, which integrates channel complementary coordinate attention (C3A) and cross-spatial fusion (CSF) to enhance spatial-channel feature modeling and improve the ability to capture complementary information between modalities. Additionally, class-level feature alignment (CLFA) introduces auxiliary supervision to improve unimodal feature learning and model robustness. Experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and PIE-RGB-SAR datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving the best overall performance compared with representative approaches."

    "abstract": "Multimodal haptic feedback that combines electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) and vibrotactile signals can create richer, more immersive experiences than those using a single modality. EMS delivers kinesthetic feedback by inducing muscle contractions, simulating force sensations that complement tactile stimuli from mechanical vibrations. However, presenting these stimuli concurrently can lead to perceptual interference, where one modality masks or alters the perception of the other. Temporal alignment between stimuli is also critical, as asynchrony can affect the perceived quality of haptic sensations. To investigate these phenomena, we conducted three user studies with a total of 40 participants (12, 12, and 16, respectively), focusing on mutual masking effects and temporal order perception between EMS and vibration. Our findings suggest that vibration can alleviate the tingling and discomfort commonly associated with EMS, effectively mitigating these unwanted sensations. Conversely, the presence of EMS increases the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in vibration frequency discrimination, indicating a decrease in sensitivity to vibratory changes. Additionally, participants generally perceived the stimuli as simultaneous when EMS preceded vibration by 100 to 200 milliseconds. We discuss these findings and present four design guidelines for multimodal haptic rendering with EMS and vibrations in user applications."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images plays a crucial role in geospatial applications including land cover classification, disaster assessment, and environmental monitoring. While deep neural networks have significantly advanced segmentation performance, most existing approaches neglect frequency-domain information essential for capturing complex textures and boundary details. To address this limitation, we propose WgANet, a novel three-branch network incorporating wavelet-guided attention (WgA). The architecture comprises a spatial Mamba branch built upon visual state space (VSS) blocks for global context modeling, a spatial convolutional branch for fine-grained local feature extraction, and a frequency band branch constructed with WgA blocks to capture frequency-aware representations. Furthermore, a dynamic aggregation module (DAM) at each encoding stage adaptively fuses complementary features across all branches, enhancing semantic consistency and detail preservation. We comprehensively evaluate WgANet on two widely used high-resolution remote sensing datasets, namely ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam, as well as on a more challenging dataset, LoveDA Urban. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of joint spatial–frequency modeling. Specifically, WgANet achieves 91.45% OA, 90.50% mF1, and 83.04% mIoU on ISPRS Vaihingen, and 91.31% OA, 92.28% mF1, and 86.01% mIoU on ISPRS Potsdam, indicating consistent superiority over representative state-of-the-art methods. Even on LoveDA Urban, WgANet achieves the best segmentation performance, further demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capability across complex urban scenes.

    "abstract": "Precise tumor localization and sub-region identification are critical for disease diagnosis. However, current Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) methods for brain tumor segmentation are primarily single-class, neglecting differences between tumor sub-regions. We observed that when mainstream transformer-based WSSS methods are applied to multi-class brain tumor segmentation, they encounter two major challenges: sub-region discrimination errors and over-segmentation of small lesions. To address these challenges and advance multi-class WSSS methods for brain tumor analysis, this paper proposes Channel-gated Transformers with Affinity CAM (CTAC). CTAC first employs channel-gated multi-head self-attention to overcome the over-smoothing tendency of the transformer, thereby enhancing inter-class discriminability and improving the model's subclass differentiation capability. Then, CTAC uses multi-scale smoothed affinity to adaptively suppress low-confidence responses in the Class Activation Map (CAM), mitigating over-activation in the CAM, and alleviating the over-segmentation phenomena of small lesions. The proposed CTAC significantly outperformed the baseline method on the BraTS2021 glioma and BraTS2023-MEN meningioma datasets. On Brats2021, it achieved a multi-class mean IoU (mIoU) of 61.718%, an increase of 4.964 percentage points (pp), with the whole-tumor mIoU reaching 79.798% (+6.882 pp). On Brats2023-MEN, CTAC attained 72.887% mIoU (+4.676 pp) for multi-class segmentation and 75.394% (+7.839 pp) for whole-tumor. Furthermore, CTAC surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods.

Low-complexity, VR-aware detection techniques are developed for each NOMA configuration. In this design, near-field users with distinct, non-overlapping VRs share frequency resources with a far-field user occupying a larger VR, with the proposed detection techniques ensuring effective multi-user separation. This approach enhances system capacity and supports massive connectivity within the XL-MIMO framework. Simulations demonstrate significant gains in bit error rate (BER) and SE across all users, while maintaining low complexity."

This paper proposes a maximum likelihood partial polynomial segmentation method for linearity testing of binary Nyquist ADC like SAR or Pipelined ADCs. Segmentation model with partial polynomial fitting reduces the testing parameters and required samples. The source nonlinearity removal scheme relaxes the precision requirement of signal source. Maximum likelihood estimation which considers the influence of noise and quantization error is used to improve the testing accuracy. Measurement results of 16- and 18-bit ADCs show that the proposed method reduces the signal source resolution by 7-bit compared to the histogram method. The number of samples is decreased by more than 50 times. Meanwhile, the maximum INL estimation errors are less than 0.75 and 0.8 LSB, respectively."

The method consists of three closely interconnected steps: first, we partition the scatterplot into iso-density regions and equalize visual density; then, we allocate pixels for different classes within each region; finally, we reconstruct the data distribution based on pixels. User studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach better preserves features and exhibits a special advantage when handling ultra-high dynamic range data distributions."

    "abstract": "Based on the message-passing paradigm, there has been an amount of research proposing diverse and impressive feature propagation mechanisms to improve the performance of GNNs. However, less focus has been put on feature transformation, another major operation of the message-passing framework. In this paper, we first empirically investigate the performance of the feature transformation operation in several typical GNNs. Unexpectedly, we notice that GNNs do not completely free up the power of the inherent feature transformation operation. By this observation, we propose the Bi-directional Knowledge Transfer (BiKT), a plug-and-play approach to unleash the potential of the feature transformation operations without modifying the original architecture. Taking the feature transformation operation as a derived representation learning model that shares parameters with the original GNN, the direct prediction by this model provides a topological-agnostic knowledge feedback that can further instruct the learning of GNN and the feature transformations therein. On this basis, BiKT not only allows us to acquire knowledge from both the GNN and its derived model but also promotes each other by injecting the knowledge into the other. In addition, a theoretical analysis is further provided to demonstrate that BiKT improves the generalization bound of the GNNs from the perspective of domain adaptation. An extensive group of experiments on up to 7 datasets with 5 typical GNNs demonstrates that BiKT brings up to 0.5%- 4% performance gain over the original GNN, which means a boosted GNN is obtained. Meanwhile, the derived model also shows a powerful performance to compete with or even surpass the original GNN, enabling us to flexibly apply it independently to some other specific downstream tasks."

Fault detection can be addressed by modeling baseline monitoring data and subsequently detecting faults through deviations between the baseline model and newly acquired monitoring data.

This paper attempts to combine Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) with LSTM, aiming to fully exploit the ability of LSTM to capture complex long-term dependencies as well as the strong regularization and generalization capabilities of BNN. Specifically, we propose two fault detection methods: the fault detection method based on Bayesian LSTM (BLSTM) and the fault detection method based on traditional LSTM combined with Bayesian fully connected layer (LSTM-BFC). Comparative and anti-noise experiments were conducted using data collected from a gearbox test rig. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian Neural Network-based approaches outperform traditional LSTM models in terms of fault detection performance. Among them, the LSTM-BFC method shows particularly outstanding performance in training time, time series prediction capability, fault detection accuracy, and noise robustness."

DeepBHMR consists of three components, (1) the correspondence estimation network that predicts the correspondence probabilities; (2) the posterior estimation module that computes the HMMs parameters; (3) the transformation estimation module that calculates the rigid transformation matrix by utilizing the bidirectional optimization mechanism. DeepBHMR has been extensively validated on various medical data sets, outperforming state-of-the-art registration methods. For femur bones, the mean rotation error value is approximately 1° (i.e, 1.01°) and the translation error is less than 1 mm (i.e., 0.30 mm) respectively, which meets the requirement of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Furthermore, even (1) trained with femur data and tested on distinct shapes and (2) under the large transformation, the mean RMSE values of registration are 2.60 mm and 3.05 mm respectively, demonstrating DeepBHMR’s favorable generalizability to different data shapes and great capability to handle global registration. Additionally, the individual significant contributions and computational efficiency of adopting normal vectors and utilizing the bidirectional mechanism have been validated in ablation studies. The results demonstrate the DeepBHMR’s favorable generalizability from femur bones to hip bones and that DeepBHMR can successfully handle the large transformation or partial-to-full registration simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have entered the stage of commercialization, yet their performance in interactive scenarios remains unsatisfactory due to challenges such as decision interpretability, human driver (HV) heterogeneity, and scenario diversity. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue to enhance AV interaction capabilities, but their high computational demand hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a parallel Actor–Reasoner framework designed to enable explicit and real-time bidirectional AV-HV interactions. First, the Reasoner employs a localized LLM with CoT reasoning and human instructions to progressively infer HV intent, style, AV action, and eHMI displays during the training stage. During testing, it continues to infer he above information except AV action. The Actor, in turn, is constructed as an interaction memory through the Reasoner’s interactions with heterogeneous simulated HVs across diverse scenarios, where the memory partition and two-layer retrieval modules are employed in the construction process. During testing, the Actor is used to retrieve feasible actions for the AV. Ablation studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed modules improve interaction success rates by an average of 15% and 12%, respectively. Moreover, comparison studies in multi-vehicle scenarios further show that the proposed Actor–Reasoner framework achieves superior safety while simultaneously improving efficiency. Finally, with the integration of external Human–Machine Interface (eHMI) information derived from the Reasoner’s reasoning and feasible actions retrieved from the Actor, the framework is validated in real-world field interactions.

    "abstract": "Underwater creature segmentation (UCS) is critical for marine research and robotics but faces unique challenges: environmental distortions and biological traits that distinguish it from terrestrial segmentation. While deep learning advances exist, current UCS models are constrained to low-resolution inputs, losing critical details when processing high-resolution (HR) imagery and degrading segmentation precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce UCS4K, the first large-scale HR dataset for UCS, containing 4,096 images with pixel-wise annotations. UCS4K offers 4 times higher average resolution than existing datasets, covering diverse species, habitats, and environmental complexities essential for robust model training. Additionally, we propose a Resolution-Asymmetric Dual-branch Alignment and Refinement (RADAR) network to address the efficiency-receptiveness trade-off in HR-UCS. RADAR decouples context and detail processing: a CNN branch preserves HR spatial details, while a Transformer branch models global semantics on downsampled inputs to avoid quadratic complexity. Crucially, it resolves the inherent semantic misalignment issue between branches via the Global Semantic Alignment (GSA) module in the encoder and the Bidirectional Collaborative Refinement (BCR) module-embedded decoder that progressively integrates multi-scale encoding features to sharpen boundaries. This asymmetric design ensures efficient long-range context capture without sacrificing spatial precision. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR sets new state-of-the-art performance on UCS4K and other existing datasets. Our contributions establish the first HR benchmark for UCS and deliver a scalable framework for high-precision segmentation. Dataset, code, and models will be made available."

These elements are inherently coupled: jamming degrades channel quality, prompting UAVs to adapt both their trajectories to improve spatial positioning and reduce jamming exposure, and their power allocation to maintain communication effectiveness under interference. The framework captures this interplay through a differential game for trajectory optimization and a Stackelberg game for power allocation, with the Nash equilibrium (NE) rigorously defined and its existence proved. To overcome the complexity of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is employed to approximate the value functions for both trajectory and power optimization. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating that it accurately captures the strategic interactions between UAVs and provides robust decision support for resource optimization in dynamic adversarial environments."

The first module is a conditional branch that extracts structural features from a coarsely enhanced version to guide the denoising process toward more faithful restoration. While the second module retrieves high-quality features from a pre-constructed feature dictionary as priors, effectively restoring colors and fine details in degraded regions. Extensive experiments on public underwater image datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and visually. It also generalizes well across various underwater environments, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating structural and feature-level guidance into the diffusion process.

    "abstract": "The feeding rate is a critical reference parameter for the efficient and low-loss operation control of grain combine harvesters. Current feeding rate measurement technologies face challenges such as low accuracy, poor stability, and delayed measurement results. Rapidly and accurately obtaining the feeding rate during the operation of combine harvesters has become a key focus and challenge in the field of agricultural machinery research. This paper proposes a feeding rate measurement method based on multimodal information fusion, including crop visual perception and harvester cutting load. This method first uses an image sensor to capture crop images in the working area in front of the combine harvester and proposes an improved Deeplab image segmentation algorithm to achieve accurate crop height measurement. Then, the real-time load information of the combine harvester's cutter is used to calculate the cutting area. Finally, by combining the operational speed information of the harvester, the precise feeding volume is calculated, effectively addressing the interference caused by complex working conditions in feeding rate measurement. To reduce the interference of combine harvester vibrations and electromagnetic environments on sensor signals, an M-E fusion filter is proposed to extract effective cutting resistance information, achieving accurate and stable calculation of header resistance information. Using the ROS communication mechanism combined with the Python 3.6 programming language, an intelligent measurement system software for the feeding rate of grain combine harvesters was developed. This system realizes functions such as sensor data acquisition, multi-sensor data fusion computation, and human-computer interaction. The results of the field tests showed that at various operating speeds of 2 km/h, 3 km/h, 4 km/h, and 5 km/h, the average relative errors of the feeding rate measurement results are 1.46%, 1.77%, 1.76%, and 1.53%, respectively, with an average relative error of 1.64% and a root mean square error average of 0.103×10⁻³ m³·s⁻¹. At various crop densities of 553 plants/m², 415 plants/m², 277 plants/m², and 138 plants/m², the average relative errors of the feeding rate measurement results are 1.77%, 1.5%, 2.39%, and 1.91%, respectively, with an average relative error of 1.89% and a root mean square error average of 0.061×10⁻³ m³·s⁻¹. The feeding rate measurement system developed in this study has high accuracy and strong stability, providing important measurement technology support for intelligent control research of combine harvesters and has high practical value."

    "abstract": "Trajectory planning is crucial for ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in autonomous driving, particularly in highway environments, which are critical components of intelligent transportation systems and require vehicles to navigate complex and uncertain traffic conditions. However, related methods are lack of adaptive decision-making capabilities and suffer from high algorithmic complexity. To this end, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning framework based on deep reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal planning, aiming to improve the adaptability and overall performance of autonomous driving systems in complex traffic environments. First, a data-driven decision-making method based on deep reinforcement learning is developed to establish a stable and human-like decision system. At the planning level, a variable voxel structure is designed to handle different decisions and scenarios, with the spatio-temporal feasible region constructed based on vehicle dynamics model and transportation safety regulations. Trajectory planning is then carried out using piecewise Bézier curves, incorporating various constraints. Finally, a new decision detection module is developed to ensure decision feasibility, while enhancing the self-learning ability of the DRL agent and fully leveraging the performance of the planning layer. Our proposed trajectory planning method is established based on forward decision guidance and backward optimization feedback. Experiments conducted on the highway-env simulator and the CQSkyEyeX real-world dataset show that the proposed framework outperforms the compared reinforcement learning and spatio-temporal planning methods in terms of decision-making efficiency, safety, and human-like planning."

Quantization, the process of reducing the numerical precision of model parameters, has emerged as a critical technique for compressing LLMs and accelerating inference. This paper provides an overview of LLM quantization, with a particular focus on the Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods implemented within the popular llama. cpp framework and its GGUF file format. We begin by covering quantization fundamentals, including the distinction between PTQ and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). We then describe the specific PTQ schemes employed by llama. cpp, including legacy methods, advanced K-quants, and recent IQ-quants, along with their underlying mathematical principles. The paper also discusses the impact of these techniques on model fidelity, hardware requirements, inference speed, and traces the adoption of GGUF as a de facto standard in the open-source community. This work serves as a practical guide and comprehensive reference for researchers aiming to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained hardware. By systematically documenting and comparing the PTQ methods within llama. cpp, we provide the necessary insights to navigate the trade-offs between model fidelity, inference speed, and memory footprint. This enables informed decision-making for real-world applications, from local CPU-based inference to efficient edge deployment."

The recent emergence of brain- computer interface (BCI) systems in cognitive neuroscience have provided opportunities to utilize electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to monitor and classify mental states, including stress. This paper presents NeuroFusion, which is a new embedded ensemble model that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer in order to identify stress levels from the EEG signal with high accuracy. Using the SAM40 dataset as the basis of this exploration, we extracted features from EEG recordings that were free of artifacts and developed a hybrid model that uses the spatial representation, temporal representation, and contextual representation of the EEG signal. The hybrid model achieved a classification accuracy of 93%, which is well above traditional machine learning methods.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition has become a critical area in affective computing and is used in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and adaptive AI. This research utilizes Wav2Vec2 embeddings as feature vectors and constructs a hybrid deep neural network with the inclusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, and residual connections. The model is trained using a Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation strategy with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for addressing the class imbalance in the EMODB database. The model applies residual connections to improve feature propagation, convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction, and BiLSTM layers to learn temporal dependencies in speech signals. Training is carried out with an Adam optimizer having learning rate scheduling, and validation of performance on several folds is ensured for robustness. The experimental results reflect the substantial increase in accuracy for emotion classification and confirm the ability of the suggested approach to well-capture fine-grained speech-based emotional states."

    "abstract": "Highly accurate predictions of cryptocurrency prices are of paramount importance to investors and researchers, as they can guide investment strategies and market analysis. However, due to the nonlinear and volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, it is challenging to assess the distinct characteristics of time-series data, which results in difficulties in generating appropriate and reliable price forecasts. Numerous studies have been conducted on cryptocurrency price prediction using different deep learning-based algorithms, as these techniques have shown promise in capturing the complex patterns and trends in this market. This study proposes three types of recurrent neural networks: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and Bi-Directional LSTM, for exchange rate predictions of the three major cryptocurrencies in the world, as measured by their market capitalization: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The experimental results on the three major cryptocurrencies using both Root Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error demonstrate that the Bi-LSTM model performed better in prediction than LSTM and GRU, and can be considered the most effective algorithm for this task. Bi-LSTM presented the most accurate prediction compared to GRU and LSTM, with MAPE values of 0.036, 0.041, and 0.124 for BTC, LTC, and ETH, respectively. The study suggests that the proposed prediction models are accurate and reliable in forecasting cryptocurrency prices and can be beneficial for investors, traders, and researchers in the cryptocurrency market."

    "abstract": "Motion blur is a common issue in images captured by mobile robots, often caused by rapid movement or vibrations during navigation. This distortion compromises the robot's ability to accurately perceive and interact with the environment, directly affecting the performance of tasks such as obstacle detection and path planning. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method to enhance motion-blurred images, aiming to improve the visual input quality for autonomous navigation. The proposed approach employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to generate sharp images from blurry image inputs. To train and evaluate our model, we used the GoPro dataset, which includes 3214 pairs of blurry and corresponding sharp images. We evaluated the results using standard reference-based quality metrics: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). Our method achieved high scores on both quality metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques, indicating improved visual quality and structural consistency in the enhanced images. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the perception capabilities of mobile robots operating in dynamic environments, ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous navigation."

    "abstract": "In the world of digital marketing, accurately predicting consumer behaviour is crucial to creating focused and effective tactics. This paper presents a method that uses machine learning to forecast consumer behaviour based on a large dataset consisting of 50,000 records of consumers. Demographic data, purchase history, interactions with online and mobile apps and indications of social media participation are all part of the collection. A strong data preparation pipeline was used which included filling in missing values using imputation, normalizing numerical data using z-scores, encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding and reducing dimensionality through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The principal component analysis (PCA) greatly improved computing efficiency while keeping crucial information; it kept over 91% of the overall variance with only 12 principal components. The classification methods like Logistical Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost were tested using 10-fold cross-validation. F1-score, AUC-ROC, accuracy, precision and recall measured model performance. XGBoost performed best with an AUC-ROC score of 0.95 suggesting strong purchaser-non-purchaser discrimination. The best method made real-time predictions via a scalable API. Data distribution changes were identified after deployment by weekly Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence monitoring. Model drift shown by a rise in Week 6 necessitated retraining. The results of this study demonstrate that machine learning is capable of marketing forecasting and offers an adaptable, scalable framework for involving consumers and making strategic decisions."

Conventional code optimization methods, which often place an emphasis on rules, may not be appropriate for different and changing programming patterns. Using models for machine learning, deep learning algorithms, as well as reinforcement learning approaches, this study examines how artificial intelligence (AI) could be utilized to improve code efficiency, hence improving compilation, execution speed, as well as resource consumption. AI-driven solutions provide automatic and intelligent code improvement via the analysis of code structures, identification of inefficiencies, and recommendation of changes. Code profiling, optimization, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence within the compilation procedure all assist developers in reducing execution time, memory use, and overall application performance. This paper examines current AI-based optimization methods, how they affect contemporary programming paradigms, and potential avenues for improving smart code in the future."

Developed through an iterative, user-centered design process, the Smart Quad is a tangible device that pairs with the PhET Simulation Quadrilateral creating a multimodal, inclusive learning environment for geometry. We conducted a pilot study with 4 users with blindness or low vision (BLV) and a formal user study in two settings: a classroom study with 15 students from grades 6 to 8, and individual sessions with 5 students with BLV from grades 7 to 9. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the Smart Quad in facilitating hands-on, interactive learning experiences, particularly for students with BLV, and highlight the potential for TUIs to bridge gaps in mathematics education by supporting diverse learning needs and preferences. The results suggest that TUIs like the Smart Quad can significantly improve engagement and understanding of geometric concepts, offering a promising direction for future educational tools."

These problems often involve a large number of variables and constraints, making them complex to perceive. At present, they are mainly designed and manipulated via computer code, which adds to this difficulty of appropriation. We believe that a tangible interface (TUI) could facilitate their design and/or manipulation. To explore this hypothesis, we carried out an initial systematic literature review focusing on tangible representations of generic CSPs. However, this revealed the absence of such representations for problems that are not specific to a particular application. As a result, the challenge of realizing a tangible interface representing a generic CSP is unexplored. Consequently, we conducted a second systematic literature review, focusing on tangible interfaces for specialized CSP applications (scheduling, routing, etc.). We extracted from this review forteen articles, which we listed, described, analyzed and compared."

This paper proposes a secure hybrid DRAM/MRAM memory architecture capable of in-memory computing (IMC) by seamlessly integrating volatile and non-volatile memory technologies. The design leverages DRAM’s fast read/write capabilities alongside MRAM’s scalability and endurance to support real-time and persistent computing tasks. The architecture incorporates fully analog low-power IMC crossbars for efficient matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), eliminating the need for energy-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions. Additionally, digital components enable nonlinear vector operations, enhancing the system’s functionality for deep neural network (DNN) applications. To ensure robust security for applications such as federated learning or model intellectual property (IP) protection, a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based on pre-charged sense amplifiers is also implemented, safeguarding against data tampering and unauthorized access to the network’s trained values stored on the non-volatile part of the system. The detailed post-layout simulations highlight the proposed architecture’s ability to enhance energy efficiency, computational performance, and security, thereby providing a versatile solution for addressing the challenges of next-generation computing."

Deep learning-based compression reconstruction algorithm can improve the quality and reconstruction speed of the reconstructed image. Generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM), which have excellent performance in the field of image generation have achieved excellent research results in the field of single-pixel imaging reconstruction. GAN-based models often suffer from the mode collapse problem, and the diffusion model relies on multi-step iteration to obtain a fine and smooth forward diffusion process, but its lengthy sampling process limits the reconstruction efficiency. Therefore, we propose a single-pixel imaging reconstruction algorithm EDGN that combines the advantages of the two generation models. The generative adversarial network uses the measurement and noise to generate the initial image, the denoising diffusion probability model is used to optimize the image refinement, and the high-quality reconstructed image is obtained by joint training. Besides, an adaptive regularization coefficient limited range adjustment method (ARCLA) is designed to achieve fast convergence of coefficients. Simulations and experiments confirm that our proposed enhanced dual generative network method can significantly improve the quality of image reconstruction at low measurement rates."

    "abstract": "With the acceleration of the global population aging process, fundus diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma have become major factors leading to visual impairment. In the field of ophthalmic diagnosis, the traditional diagnosis and treatment mode mainly relies on doctors to make pathological judgments by observing fundus images with the naked eye. However, due to differences in evaluation standards among doctors, there are discrepancies in diagnostic results for the same fundus photo. In addition, most doctors only specialize in specific fundus diseases, making it difficult to accurately diagnose cases where multiple diseases coexist. To tackle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a gated multi-scale hybrid vision Transformer model, designated as ViResGF-Net, for the multi-class classification of fundus diseases. The model integrates the dual-branch structure of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). While retaining the global modeling capability of ViT, it performs local feature extraction through the CNN branch and introduces the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) structure to further enhance the local feature extraction capability of the CNN branch. In the feature fusion stage, a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) module is added to fuse the feature vectors of the two branches. Finally, the MLP classifier gives the prediction results based on the integrated feature vectors. Through extensive experiments, our model achieved an accuracy of 93.56%, a precision of 92.99%, and an F1 score of 92.36%, all of which are better than those of other models."

However, the diverse morphology and fuzzy boundaries of gastrointestinal tumors incur substantial challenges for existing segmentation models, leading to inaccurate feature capture and generating suboptimal results. For solving these problems, we design an edge-guided multi-scale frequency attention network for the gastrointestinal tumor segmentation task, termed EGMFA-Net, which consists of a Kernel Adaptive Enhancement Module (KAEM) and a Frequency-domain Self-attention Module (FDSA). Specifically, KAEM adaptively adjusts the feature extraction kernel based on the morphology of different lesion regions, which enhances the recognition of different morphology regions via a progressive optimization strategy of feature expression. Furthermore, FDSA effectively aggregates multi-scale features in the frequency domain to achieve global receptive fields while preserving more high-frequency details, thereby enhancing adaptability to complex pathological contexts. Extensive experiments on eight medical image benchmark datasets, including SEED, Kvasir, ClinicDB, ColonDB, ETIS, BKAI, CVC-300, and Synapse, show that EGMFA-Net attains state-of-the-art performance over existing methods.

    "abstract": "With the continuous rise in cancer incidence and mortality, drug resistance has emerged as a critical challenge in cancer therapy. Conventional monotherapy often fails to address tumor cell heterogeneity and multiple drug resistance, resulting in limited efficacy, whereas combination therapy—through the synergistic effects of multiple drugs—can significantly enhance treatment outcomes and delay resistance development. However, accurately predicting drug synergism remains a formidable task due to the complex interplay of factors such as drug molecular features, drug–drug interactions, target proteins, and cell line characteristics, with current methods falling short in integrating these multidimensional data. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-task learning framework—MTFuseSyn—which constructs and integrates multiple tasks, including drug–target interactions and drug–drug interactions. To obtain richer drug features, the framework incorporates a graph aggregation module that leverages an adaptive attention mechanism to automatically identify and focus on key molecular substructures highly correlated with synergistic effects. Additionally, the framework integrates multimodal cell line data to learn richer and context-relevant cellular feature representations, thereby providing robust biological support for prediction. To effectively integrate knowledge across tasks, we design a task fusion attention module to dynamically capture potential associations among multiple tasks. Experimental results on the authoritative DrugCombDB and Oncology-Screen datasets demonstrate that MTFuseSyn significantly outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks, underscoring the importance of multidimensional information fusion in drug synergy prediction. Ablation studies and case analyses further validate the efficacy of the proposed modules."

    "abstract": "Due to the difficulty of obtaining labeled data for hyperspectral images (HSIs), cross-scene classification has emerged as a widely adopted approach in the remote sensing community. It involves training a model using labeled data from a source domain (SD) and unlabeled data from a target domain (TD), followed by inference on the TD. However, variations in the reflectance spectrum of the same object between the SD and the TD, as well as differences in the feature distribution of the same land cover class, pose significant challenges to the performance of cross-scene classification. To address this issue, we propose a dual classification head self-training network (DHSNet). This method aligns class-wise features across domains, ensuring that the trained classifier can accurately classify TD data of different classes. We introduce a dual classification head self-training strategy for the first time in the cross-scene HSI classification field and design a self-training loss based on the prediction of the two classification heads. The proposed approach mitigates the domain gap while preventing the accumulation of incorrect pseudo-labels in the model. Additionally, we incorporate a novel central feature attention mechanism to enhance the model’s capacity to learn scene-invariant features across domains. DHSNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three cross-scene HSI datasets, achieving 80.23±1.92% OA on the Houston dataset. The code for DHSNet will be available at https://github.com/liurongwhm."

We present MLCvis, a visual analysis tool developed following a nine-step design study methodology, which supports deeper and more interpretable evaluation and comparison of classifiers, including multi-label ones. Based on the needs of domain experts, MLCvis enables analysis at global, label, and instance levels through linked visualization components. It supports a range of data types (audio, text, image) and addresses common challenges in classifier inspection, including ambiguous labels and threshold sensitivity. We demonstrate MLCvis across three use cases and report findings from two user studies (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i> = 6 each).

    "abstract": "In recent years, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely used for latency-sensitive tasks, but task scheduling in dynamic edge environments still faces two key challenges. First, edge devices are prone to failures, and existing fault-tolerance mechanisms lack task-aware modeling, making it hard to ensure timeliness and reliability under failures. Second, due to limited perception, high communication costs, and complex task structures, current scheduling strategies still struggle with adaptability and stability in dynamic systems. In this paper, we propose a Fault-Tolerant Discrete Soft Actor-Critic scheduling algorithm (FT-DSAC). Initially, we design a Primary-Backup-based Fault-Tolerant (PBFT) scheduling mechanism, which constrains task offloading locations and start times to effectively mitigate the impact of failures on task execution. Furthermore, we incorporate the Centralized Training and Distributed Execution (CTDE) architecture, which enables implicit collaborative scheduling decisions among edge servers to optimize system performance and reduce communication overhead. Finally, We conduct extensive experiments using both simulated data generated by DAGGEN and real-world workflow data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves task execution success rates by 6%-19% and reduces latency by 9%-27% compared to mainstream benchmarks."

A 3D-folded radiator configuration is employed in the proposed design, achieving an aperture reduction of 37% compared to conventional patch antenna. Besides, the in-band polarization isolation is enhanced through the introduction of a defected ground structure (DGS). Finally, ball grid array (BGA) packaging technology is adopted to replace bulky connectors, enabling direct and ultra-compact integration between the antenna array and active beamforming circuits. This integration strategy reduces maximum metal layers per board by 43% compared to conventional tile-type designs fabricated using monolithic multilayer PCB, and suppresses parallel-plate waveguide (PPW) mode interference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed antenna element can achieve an overlapped bandwidth of 25.5% (23.3–30.1 GHz). The developed APA exhibits a ±60° wide-angle beam scanning capability for both polarizations with gain variations below 2.6 dB, and obtains a peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 34.7 dBm within the operating band. Error vector magnitude (EVM) below 4.2% is realized in wireless signal transmission experiments using 16/32/64-QAM 400-Mbaud modulated signals. The proposed APA demonstrates significant merits of ultra-compact size, high integration, and wide-angle scanning capability, making it a promising candidate for mmWave terminal applications."

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been a longstanding focus in clinical and neuroscience research, particularly with the growing use of multi-site functional MRI (fMRI) data. However, most existing methods often suffer from limitations such as inadequate multi-modal data fusion and insufficient mining of implicit features. To address these challenges, an end-to-end multi-modal topology-integrated graph neural network (MTIF-GNN) is proposed for multi-site ASD diagnosis. MTIF-GNN constructs two complementary population graphs to fully extract and integrate both explicit and implicit features, aiming to achieve more accurate diagnostic results. To further enhance network performance, an adaptive topology update (ATU) module is designed to dynamically adjust and optimize the graph structure within MTIF-GNN, enabling more effective capture of latent relationships among nodes and global topological patterns. Finally, this study achieves deep integration of explicit and implicit features through joint learning optimization of the graph neural network, and obtains the ASD diagnosis results using a multi-layer perceptron. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and also achieves excellent performance in diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD), indicating its broad applicability across various psychiatric disorders and providing effective support for cross-disorder brain function research.

    "abstract": "Power electronic systems are widely used for efficient power processing across various applications. However, due to their nonlinear behavior and susceptibility to disturbances, modeling and simulation are essential for fully understanding their complex interactions. The waveform relaxation (WR) method is employed to solve subsystems independently, with data exchanged until convergence is reached, offering flexibility in selecting solvers and integration techniques. In power electronics, applying the WR method with time windowing improves simulation stability and accuracy by introducing an equation to determine the optimal number of time windows. A time windowing technique is proposed, for the first time, for the co-simulation of a closed-loop power circuit divided into a first subsystem (converter) and a second subsystem (Proportional-Integral controller). These two subsystems are supposed to be designed by two different entities, which are not allowed to exchange their respective models for intellectual property reasons. The time windowing WR method is applied to transfer the data from subsystem 1 to 2. More importantly, an analytical model for the implementation of a time windowing WR technique is developed. This equation allows a deterministic choice of the number of time windows at each iteration, for convergence, based on windowing size and simulation parameters. Results show consistent output within a specified voltage range, with reduced CPU simulation time compared to co-simulation with an arbitrary selection of numbers of time windows, while being comparable to the full system simulation. The proposed technique is implemented with an input voltage range of 1.8-3 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V$</tex-math></inline-formula>, resulting in consistent outputs of 3.3 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V$</tex-math></inline-formula> in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation modes. The comparative analysis demonstrates that with an increased number of iterations, the elapsed time is 11.1% and 5.6% faster for continuous- and discrete-time simulation modes, respectively, compared to a co-simulation with time windows. Furthermore, the time windowing WR method closely aligns with the full system result, with only a slight difference in elapsed time. Additionally, to validate the proposed analytical model using the time windowing WR technique in a closed-loop circuit, the buck converter is evaluated and compared without the full system. These results highlight the accuracy of WR with time windowing method and illustrate the quicker convergence achieved when used in circuit co-simulation."

These patterns, or network motifs, can often be detected algorithmically. However, visual inspection remains vital for exploring and discovering patterns. This paper focuses on presenting motifs within BioFabric network visualizations-a unique technique that opens opportunities for research on scaling to larger networks, design variations, and layout algorithms to better expose motifs. Our goal is to show how highlighting motifs can assist users in identifying and interpreting patterns in BioFabric visualizations. To this end, we leverage existing motif simplification techniques. We replace edges with glyphs representing fundamental motifs such as staircases, cliques, paths, and connector nodes. The results of our controlled experiment and usage scenarios demonstrate that motif simplification for BioFabric is useful for detecting and interpreting network patterns. Our participants were faster and more confident using the simplified view without sacrificing accuracy. The efficacy of our current motif simplification approach depends on which extant layout algorithm is used. We hope our promising findings on user performance will motivate future research on layout algorithms tailored to maximizing motif presentation."

This research looks at how much FinTech innovations like peer-to- peer lending, blockchain, digital payment platforms, and robo-advisory services have affected conventional banks' performance. The study measures the association among FinTech growth indicators as well as banks' key performance indicators (KPIs) such as cost-to-income ratio and client retention using a comparative analytical technique and a recently created FinTech Activity Index (FAI). Using visual analytics for interpretability, a model based on multiple linear regression was used to examine longitudinal data from 2015 to 2024. An R2 value of 0.82 indicates good predictive potential, and the results show a statistically significant adverse association between FinTech activity as well as conventional banking performance. To maintain competitiveness in a financial ecosystem driven by digital technology, this study believes that FinTech is a transformational disruptor rather than just a complementary force, requiring aggressive government and deliberate bank adaptation."

It doesn’t sit right with many to compare the competitive, cunning and brutal realm of law with the new age technology of Artificial Intelligence, they seem miles apart in terms of their nature and very foundations. But what is synonymous throughout in these two fields, is the aim to do progress by the second and have a meaningful contribution in the world. Lawyers spend much of their day jostling through files that may or may not contain data relevant to their work, or maybe they need to fetch some document from an online resource and, compare it with another document, summarize or even analyse some legal data. These legal professionals have a lot on their plate and the last thing they want is to be stuck in the middle of a vortex meagre tasks that hinder their progress towards the more important tasks of the day. Hence, to counter this issue we have tried to review the work done in the field of AI Legal Assistants, an AI assistant which shall be equipped with an arsenal of skills that enable it to tackle any previously mentioned task sent its way using the concepts of RAG and LLM. The amalgamation of Law and Gen AI might come off as a juxtaposition of opposite poles, but it truly is the pair that shall lead the future of both Law and Generative AI with its beguiling impact on the world."

    "abstract": "The liberalization and globalization programs implemented as part of the 1991 economic reforms have had a major impact on the substantial structural change that the Indian economy has seen over the last few decades. While fiscal policy has become an increasingly important tool for guiding development, however relationship analysis between public expenditure and economic growth has often yielded inconsistent results, particularly in establishing a clear, long-term connection. This study examines the expenditure by government and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in Indian economy, examining time series dataset from 1990 to 2023. To analyze the underlying dynamics, the analysis employs co-integration techniques along with the vector error correction mode (VECM). This approach determines both long run equilibrium and short run adjustments between the two economic variables.Empirical analysis indicates a significant long run relationship between government expenditure and economic growth, with capital expenditure playing a key role in driving economic performance. Furthermore, the findings support the relevance of Wagner’s Law in the Indian context, highlighting a unidirectional causal relationship from public expenditure to GDP Growth. This study adds to the continuing scholarly conversation on fiscal policy and development by providing new insights for the relation between govt. expenditure and economic growth across time. The current study recommends to develop more growth-oriented and successful public finance and economic planning strategies."

We propose the use of the NAO V6 humanoid robot as a mediator for a PECS-Adapted system, wherein children utilize visual cards featuring QR codes to express actions, desires, and feelings. The robot is designed to recognize these QR codes, verbalize the corresponding message, and provide interactive feedback. This research, grounded in the Design Science Research framework, will involve a qualitative, exploratory study with five children with ASD, aged 5–10 years, over a two-month period. The intervention aims to enhance expressive communication, increase communicative spontaneity, and facilitate social interaction, ultimately promoting more effective school inclusion.

The model incorporates feature engineering techniques that extract temporal trends and periodic patterns from historical solar generation data, weather, and seasonal cycles. By focusing on relevant time-series characteristics, the proposed methodology enhances the learning capability of the XGBoost model. Performance evaluation using standard metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) demonstrate that the proposed model delivers high forecasting accuracy and outperforms several conventional prediction methods.

    "abstract": "In the era of data-driven decision-making, selecting appropriate nonlinear modeling techniques is critical for building robust and interpretable predictive systems. While both Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models and Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks are well-established universal approximators in the data science domain, their fundamentally different structural characteristics lead to varied performance across application scenarios. This paper presents a systematic comparative study of these two modeling approaches through a series of simulation experiments designed to reflect key tasks in predictive analytics, including static function approximation, dynamic system modeling and forecasting, and real-time state tracking of time-varying systems. By evaluating performance across multiple dimensions modeling accuracy, robustness to noise, and adaptability to temporal dynamics, this work provides actionable insights into the practical strengths and limitations of each model type. The results show that T-S fuzzy models offer superior accuracy in clean, stable environments, while BP neural networks demonstrate strong resilience to noise and generalization ability in uncertain conditions. Additionally, T-S fuzzy models exhibit higher adaptability in real-time, dynamic contexts, making them valuable for time-sensitive predictive applications. This study contributes to the broader data science community by offering a structured framework for model selection based on application-specific demands, helping practitioners and researchers alike to optimize predictive modeling strategies for complex, nonlinear systems."

    "abstract": "Path planning plays a crucial role for autonomous vehicles operating in complex environments, where efficient and reliable navigation is of paramount importance. Traditional path planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and its variants, are widely used but often suffer from inefficient exploration and suboptimal path generation, particularly in cluttered environments. This work introduces QTree-RRT, a hybrid approach designed to improve path planning by guiding the exploration process through a hierarchical spatial decomposition. The method first decomposes the environment using a Quadtree representation, then computes an initial coarse path through the free regions using a graph search algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra or A*). This preliminary path defines the relevant regions in which RRT sampling is then concentrated, leading to a more focused and efficient exploration. Experimental evaluations in simulated environments with varying obstacle densities show that QTree-RRT consistently outperforms classical RRT and its variants RRT* and RRT-Connect. The proposed approach achieves lower execution times (1.6s), reduces the number of required samples (295), and generates paths with better cost (475.39) and quality, demonstrating its effectiveness as a path planning solution for mobile robots."

The sentiment analysis application based on AI has increased power of prediction by about 35-50% compared to typical models (OECD, 2023), thereby mitigating limitations related to backward-looking economic appraisals. This study presents a novel computational methodology involving Job Market Sentiment (JMS), Mental Health Index (MHI), Social Cohesion Index (SCI), and Economic Growth (EG) in designing a contemporaneous Economic Stability Index (ESI). It enhances the quick response of policies, maximizes labor market performance, and builds resilience in economies by providing contemporaneous economic information enriched by artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "As autonomous systems increasingly demonstrate more sophisticated reasoning capabilities and make higher-level decisions, the need for interpretable runtime guidance becomes critical. Traditional Models@Runtime serve as abstractions that reflect system state to support adaptation and decision-making by external actors. We extend this paradigm by introducing Ambient Advisory Models, where model components such as classes, agents, or behavioral specifications are augmented with embedded reasoning capabilities that observe, interpret, and advise. Unlike conventional runtime models that provide passive structural or behavioral representations, each model component in our approach becomes an active advisory entity, continuously monitoring its domain of concern and generating contextual guidance. These advisory components operate without direct actuation authority, functioning as cognitive guardrails that provide guidance on safety, regulatory, ethical, and other relevant concerns, while enabling multi-perspective reasoning. Rather than a monolithic reasoning model, we distribute advisory intelligence across individual model components, each maintaining its own reasoning context and concern-specific knowledge. We demonstrate Ambient Advisory Models in autonomous multi-UAV emergency response operations. This approach transforms selected runtime models from reflective artifacts into proactive advisors, enabling a new form of human-AI collaboration where model components actively participate in system governance rather than merely representing system state."

The mechanism uses diabolo rollers to move the eggs without damaging them at a controlled speed, which provides sufficient time for machine vision to detect the shell color. As a result, the mechanism classifier transported six eggs with an angular speed of 19 RPM, and the shell color recognition exhibited a precision of 97%.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted significant attention for their effectiveness in fake news detection, particularly due to their capability to leverage the social context embedded within news dissemination. Most existing studies, however, operate on static heterogeneous information networks (HINs), assuming these graphs adequately capture the complex interactions among social entities. In practice, the dynamic nature of real-world social networks presents a substantial challenge, as training on suboptimal or outdated graph structures can severely limit the expressiveness of GNNs. Although various approaches have been proposed to model dynamic HINs, they often rely on computationally expensive message-passing mechanisms to update node embeddings, which hinders scalability to large social graphs. In this paper, we introduce DHGNN (Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network), a novel model designed to address these challenges. DHGNN simplifies traditional GNN message-passing by employing a dynamic propagation scheme inspired by the personalized PageRank tracking process in HINs. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DHGNN in detecting fake news."

    "abstract": "High cross-polarization (XP) levels in compact antennas with irregular triangular geometries primarily originate from asymmetric apertures, leading to degraded polarization purity. In this paper, the sources of XP are identified and reduced in sixteenth-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (SMSIW) antennas based on irregular triangular configurations—right-angled (RT-SMSIW) and scalene (ST-SMSIW) structures. A theoretical model is developed by formulating radiation pattern equations for each aperture to gain insight into H-plane XP sources. Based on this model, an L-shaped stub is strategically integrated at a key aperture, simultaneously influencing both polarization components (E<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">θ</sub> and E<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">φ</sub>) to achieve a larger overall XP reduction. The proposed designs are validated through simulations and measurements, demonstrating a peak H-plane XP reduction of −32.0 dB at 3.0 GHz and −25.0 dB at 2.9 GHz for the RT-SMSIW and ST-SMSIW antennas, respectively. The antennas also maintain ultra-compactness with frequency tuning without added complexity, making them well-suited for wireless applications."

    "abstract": "Superarrays refer to microphone arrays that combine both omnidirectional and directional sensors, enabling higher array gain or additional functionalities that traditional arrays with the same geometry cannot achieve. In our previous work, we demonstrated that concentric circular superarrays (CCSAs) can achieve directivity and three-dimensional (3D) steering capabilities comparable to volumetric arrays, but with a more compact, two-dimensional geometry. This makes CCSAs particularly promising for high-fidelity speech signal in compact devices. However, prior CCSA designs have been limited to omnidirectional and bidirectional sensors, restricting their flexibility and broader applicability. Additionally, the theoretical conditions required for effective array configuration remain unclear. This paper introduces a generalized framework for designing CCSAs and their corresponding fully steerable, frequency-invariant beamformers in 3D space. The contributions are twofold: 1) a method is proposed for designing 3D steerable, frequency-invariant beamformers using CCSAs equipped with directional microphones of arbitrary types; and 2) the necessary and sufficient conditions for array configurations are derived to enable effective design of first-, second-, and third-order frequency-invariant beamformers. We further summarize the construction of first-, second-, and third-order beamformers. Extensive simulations and real experiments validate the proposed method and demonstrate the practical efficacy and theoretical novelty of our approach."

    "abstract": "To monitor environmental radiation dose rates, a cerium-doped gadolinium gallium aluminum garnet (GAGG:Ce) fiber-coupled dosimeter was developed for the first time. The dosimeter utilized three optical fiber parameters: core diameter of 400μm with a length of 113m, core diameter of 400μm with a length of 1m, and core diameter of 1000μm with a length of 1m. Within the dose rate ranges of 0.1–998mGy/h, 0.04–980mGy/h, and 0.01–982mGy/h, all three optical fiber dosimeters exhibited linear responses. The net count rate variation coefficient of a single remote measurement experiment using the fiber dosimeter with a 400μm core diameter and 113m length at a dose rate of 200mGy/h was 0.56%, while the average variation coefficient from 10 repeated irradiation experiments was 0.76%. These results indicate that the remote optical fiber dosimeter achieved stable dose rate measurements from 0.1 to 998mGy/h at a distance of 113m. The GAGG:Ce optical fiber dosimeter met the requirements for remote real-time monitoring of environmental radiation dose rates."

    "abstract": "This document details the design of a low-power, high-gain low-noise amplifier (LNA) in 45-nm CMOS. The superb RF metrics and small footprint of the device make it an excellent candidate for integration into ultrawideband impulse radio (IR-UWB) and 6G satellite communication systems. Exceptional performance is obtained by carefully optimizing voltage and current distributions for each transistor in the multistage amplifier, specifically at the input, where an extremely power efficient topology is adopted. The input stage leverages two complementary current reuse amplifier cells stacked in series between the supply rail and ground. Sharing a common dc bias current, their RF currents are summed in parallel through capacitive coupling. This allows for a fourfold power savings with no penalty to voltage gain when compared to a conventional approach. At each gain stage, a degree of device stacking is chosen to progress toward a Pareto optimal voltage distribution (POVD), which considers the available supply voltage, expected RF signal swing, and minimum operating voltage of the FET devices. Judicious consideration of these factors can yield power savings at no cost to gain, linearity, or noise. Adhering to this design methodology enables an LNA, which consumes 6.5 mW of power, and demonstrates a peak gain of 24.1 dB, 2.9-GHz bandwidth (BW), a 4.3-dB noise figure (NF), and an IP1dB of −22.9 dBm. This equates to an excellent LNA figures of merit (FOM) when compared to similar devices in the C- and X-bands."

    "abstract": "The dual active bridge (DAB) converter is promising for DC systems since it provides galvanic insolation and high efficiency. In most situations, the full-bridge AC output and DC voltage are observed, while overlooking the possible high frequency voltage oscillations (HFVOs) at the transformer port. HFVOs threaten the insulation of transformers. The causes of HFVOs have not yet been clarified. This paper finds that HFVOs are caused by the harmonics within the series-resonance frequency band, rather than the single frequency. Moreover, existing solutions mostly rely on optimizing transformer winding structures, which causes a tradeoff between HFVOs, efficiency, and insulation performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a modulation method that reduces HFVOs by optimizing the output harmonic content in the resonance band. The root mean square (RMS) current of the inductor is also optimized simultaneously to ensure efficiency. The proposed strategy is validated on a 12kW/50kHz/750V prototype. Compared to the method that only optimizes the RMS current, the proposed one achieved the optimal RMS current while reducing voltage oscillations by 77%."

    "abstract": "Inverter systems play a critical role in modern power conversion and energy management applications, where they often operate under diverse and complex modes. The presence of multiple operating modes leads to varying data distributions, posing significant challenges for accurate fault detection across different working scenarios. Existing methods struggle to disentangle mode-invariant and mode-specific features that effectively represent incipient faults, while also lacking selective attention across the disentangled feature spaces. To address this issue, this article proposes a shared and exclusive representation learning model (SERLM) for fault detection in multimode inverter systems. SERLM leverages shared and exclusive modules to extract mode-invariant and mode-specific features, respectively, and employs a novel multi-scale regularized channel attention (MRCA) strategy to enhance feature fusion. Additionally, two statistics are designed: one based on shared features to detect global anomalies across modes and another derived from reconstruction error to capture localized deviations. The effectiveness of feature extraction in SERLM is rigorously analyzed from a theoretical perspective. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on a power inverter system, demonstrating its superiority in detecting incipient faults under multiple modes, achieving a fault detection rate that is 6.25% higher than state-of-the-art methods."

To achieve accurate and interpretable stage-level prediction, we propose XAPT, an eXplainable, anomaly-driven framework for APT campaign analysis. XAPT is centered on three key innovations. First, we derive PCA-based reconstruction errors and transform them into calibrated probabilistic anomaly scores, enabling principled quantification of the event abnormality. Second, these calibrated scores are incorporated into a Bayesian Network-based multiclass classifier for cyber-kill-chain stage inference, capturing uncertainty and inter-feature dependencies. Third, SHAP-based feature attribution reveals how anomaly scores and other features contribute to classification outcomes, offering transparent and analytically friendly explanations. Evaluation of two public datasets shows that XAPT achieves high stage-level detection accuracy while producing actionable feature-level interpretations that support operational analysis. By unifying calibrated anomaly scoring, Bayesian inference, and SHAP explanation, XAPT offers a comprehensive and interpretable solution for advanced threat detection."

    "abstract": "Complex human activity recognition (CHAR) remains a pivotal challenge within ubiquitous computing, especially in the context of smart environments. Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both lower-level and higher-level activities—a task that is laborintensive and prone to errors, focusing on datasets that precisely label simple activities or their sequences. These approaches are often impractical in real-world settings due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. In response to these challenges, we introduce VCHAR (Variance-Driven Complex Human Activity Recognition), a novel framework capable of detecting both low-level activities and their corresponding high-level activities without requiring precise temporal or sequential labeling of the lower-level activities.We introduce a novel approach by applying KL divergence as the objective function, modeling the outputs of lower-level activities as distributions over target time intervals while concurrently detecting higher-level activities. This method only requires vaguely labeled activities, removing the need for precise, second-by-second annotations.Additionally, to enhance the layperson’s understanding of our model’s results, we are the first to apply a novel generative method that explains result of the sensor model through video, making the information more accessible and understandable.Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that VCHAR uses KL divergence to model the lower-level activity distribution over specific time intervals, enhancing the accuracy of complex activity recognition. Furthermore, user studies confirm that VCHAR’s explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts."

Large-scale empirical measurements of these technologies at 800 MHz and 1800 MHz have been conducted to assess the commercial network signal coverage and quality levels. More precisely, we show how to evaluate measurement samples against enhanced coverage level (ECL) repetitions. We consider signal strength and quality distributions as inputs for planning and evaluating a large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network. Three different types of typical city environments have been considered for these purposes. The analysis shows that, in most cases, CAT-M will outperform NB-IoT when implemented at 800 MHz, considering sensor energy consumption per single transmitted message. ECL repetitions on a lower frequency (800 MHz) implementation are caused mainly by low signal quality, where less than 2% of measured signal level samples are in the ECL2 and 1 range, but more than 30% of measured signal quality samples are in the ECL2 and 1 range. Repetitions on higher frequencies (1800 MHz) are dictated by signal level and quality, with more than 40% of signal level samples and 50% of signal quality samples in the ECL2 and 1 range. Signal level and quality distributions will provide a basis for sensor lifetime estimation and support efficient integrated IoT asset management system management."

The porous electrodes are based on graphene nanoplatelets (GNP-3A) and polyamide 66 (PA66) materials. First, through electrical performance testing, it is demonstrated that the proposed dry electrode has high conductivity, with a skin contact impedance of 17.6 kΩ at 100Hz, significantly lower than commercial Ag/AgCl wet electrodes. In addition, the electrode can accurately capture ECG signals with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 34.76 dB, which is an 8% improvement over traditional Ag/AgCl wet electrodes. Additionally, the design optimizes wearability by using soft and highly elastic fabric and integrates electrodes using metal snap buttons to reduce the discomfort typically caused by traditional wet electrodes, thereby enhancing comfort during prolonged use. Subsequently, to evaluate the performance improvements of the smart ECG T-shirt in terms of comfort and signal acquisition, a self-constructed ECG monitoring system was used to record single-lead ECG signals from adult males wearing the smart ECG T-shirt, under different motion states such as resting, walking, and jogging. The P-Q-R-S-T characteristic peaks, motion artifacts, and noise were assessed and compared with commercially available ECG monitoring T-shirts. The comparison results indicate that the integrated design of the electrode and T-shirt effectively balances comfort and performance in practical applications, with no skin irritation or discomfort observed during prolonged use. This work offers an innovative and practical solution for daily, comprehensive, wearable, and scalable ECG monitoring, showing great promise for future applications."

Circuit synthesis, in both its exact and its approximate variant, is fundamental to the circuit model of quantum computing. As an engineering problem, however, the practical and theoretical aspects of quantum circuit synthesis are far from being fully understood. Particularly, this concerns explicit methods for gate-agnostic circuit synthesis and questions of gate efficiency. More than 20 years ago, Harrow et al. published their famous spectral gap theorem – given a suitable family of quantum gates, it is possible to approximate any unitary transformation by means of a quantum circuit whose length is proportional to the required accuracy's logarithm. Moreover, Harrow et al. suspected that all universal gate families allow for this type of approximation, a hypothesis that became known as the spectral gap conjecture and remains unproven until today. Being an entirely classical task, quantum circuit synthesis must be considered in the context of digital computing – that is, in the context of Turing computability and computable analysis. Using the relevant mathematical framework, we establish no-go results concerning exact quantum circuit synthesis and quantum big-O analysis. Our findings relate to the theory of approximate t-designs, which has recently received notable attention through the literature. Moreover, as follows from our findings, the existence of an algorithm that computes leading big-O coefficients would prove the spectral gap conjecture true within the computable special unitary group."

    "abstract": "Humans possess seven types of intelligence for learning. However, conventional educational systems mostly rely only on the Linguistic and Mathematical types. This narrow focus leaves other intelligences unrecognized and unutilized in learners’ learning processes. The main challenge lies in holistically addressing diverse intelligence levels in typical educational settings. Prior research isolated dominant intelligence traits for personalization, which lack objectivity and fail to utilize the full spectrum of learning potentials. The goal of this research is to identify and predict underlying learning patterns in university students, enabling addressing all types of intelligence holistically at the group level. To achieve this, a multi-algorithm framework integrating unsupervised and supervised learning is developed to analyze Multiple Intelligences profiles and associated learner parameters from the Learning Meta-Learning dataset. MI profiles capture all seven types of intelligences. K-Means clustering identified three unique and interpretable MI profile patterns, outperforming the Two-Step clustering algorithm. For prediction, CatBoost achieved 92.20% accuracy across seven algorithms, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and HistGradientBoosting. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence through Shapley Additive Explanations and optimizing features, its accuracy improved to 93.66%. The identified Multiple Intelligences profile patterns offer actionable insights. Beyond the high-level guidelines for personalizing instruction outlined in this paper, they can inform various personalized educational approaches and support further research by providing a structured understanding of learner diversity and a predictive framework."

However, invariant environment represents a robust assumption in many visual SLAM systems, and this assumption constrains the operation of many visual SLAM systems in dynamic realistic environments that are the target of intelligent robotics, autonomous driving, and many other related applications. To address the issue that the existence of dynamic objects within environments seriously damages visual SLAM systems, we propose RSG-SLAM, a visual SLAM system built upon ORB-SLAM3 for visualizing dynamic scenes, using a dynamic mask compensation method and geometric association constraint method to enhance the accuracy of visual SLAM trajectory. First, a dynamic mask compensation method built upon the constant velocity model, feature affine constraints and mask boundary refinement is proposed to realize the accurate segmentation of dynamic objects in terms of semantics. Secondly, for dynamic entities that are not detected by semantic segmentation, a geometric correlation constraint model built upon the invariant characteristics of the absolute positions of static points is proposed, which removes feature points that do not satisfy motion consistency. In dynamic realistic environments, RSG-SLAM demonstrates sufficient accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance. RSG-SLAM supports both stereo and RGB-D sensors. Experimental results on the TUM, Bonn, KITTI datasets and real environments illustrate that RSG-SLAM is capable of enhancing the performance of the benchmark method in challenging dynamic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Traditional viscoacoustic migration methods effectively compensate for amplitude loss and phase distortion caused by viscous attenuation. However, these methods predominantly focus on achieving accurate structural imaging. Preserving relative-amplitude information in migrated images is crucial for accurately restoring medium properties while imaging geometric structures under viscous attenuation conditions. In this paper, we present an efficient and stable method for viscoacoustic true-amplitude Gaussian beam migration in the common-offset domain, specifically designed to tackle this challenge. Our approach utilizes the multiparameter viscoacoustic Born scattering mechanism to recover the velocity and quality factor <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>. The incorporation of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i> into the migration process is achieved by defining <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i>-related complex-valued traveltime to compensate for attenuation effects. We illustrate the forward single scattering integral for the central beam component of the viscoacoustic common-offset scattered pressure wavefield, using attenuation-compensated Gaussian-beam expansions of the viscoacoustic Green’s function. This description, along with the estimation of the kernel of the single-scattering Hessian operator, enables us to develop a viscoacoustic Gaussian-beam pseudoinverse migration operator for common-offset data. This operator includes a Beylkin determinant and an invertible normal matrix associated with a causality term. Employing this derived pseudoinverse operator enhances subsurface structure imaging accuracy and preserves amplitude response information of material parameters throughout the viscoacoustic migration process. Numerical experiments and field data tests demonstrate that, with the proposed attenuation compensation method, it is possible to align the estimated parameters with their true values, yielding more accurate imaging and parameter estimations in viscoacoustic media compared to the traditional acoustic approach without attenuation compensation."

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of store brands has attracted both retailers and national manufacturers to participate in store brand operations. However, retailers face a strategic decision regarding whether to disclose the national manufacturer's identity information, especially considering the impacts of the brand spillover effect and online reviews. This research investigates the retailer's disclosure strategy by developing a two-period model and exploring how this decision impacts online review ratings. Our findings illustrate that although the brand spillover effect of disclosing the national manufacturer's identity information can elevate consumers' quality expectations for store brands, the influence of online reviews may diminish or even reverse this benefit. Specifically, a stronger brand spillover effect may adversely affect both parties and thus inhibit the retailer from disclosing such information, which is different from the conventional wisdom. Moreover, we demonstrate that disclosing the national manufacturer's identity is not advantageous for the retailer when the degree of the brand spillover effect is relatively low, consumers are more reference-dependent and rely more on online reviews to formulate quality expectations, and the quality level of the store brand is perceived as moderate. Finally, we consider several extensions, including strategic consumers, distinct pricing power structures, the effect of the national brand's online reviews, asymmetric consumer numbers, and heterogeneous consumer ratings, which either confirm the robustness of our findings or enrich the basic findings."

    "abstract": "Computational drug repositioning technology can identify potential uses for existing drugs and reduce the time and cost required in the drug development process. How to find appropriate representations of drugs and diseases to predict the associations between the two is the main objective of such tasks. With the emergence of graph neural networks in recent years, researchers learned drugs and diseases via graphs in a bid to improve the prediction accuracy. However, there are three key problems that have not been adequately studied: 1) They usually place drug disease association graphs, drug-drug similarity graphs, and disease-disease similarity graphs under the same se mantic space for learning, which lose the higher-order features of the different graphs. 2) They assign equal weight to each neighbor node when aggregating based on the drug disease association graph, but the effect and mechanism of a drug in treating different diseases are not consistent. 3) They adopt residual connections to enhance the role of the root node without considering that this operation amplifies the effect of anomalous features. In view of this, we first propose a graph attention network-based spatial decomposition method for drug repositioning. Specifically, we reduce the dimensions of the feature space by spatial decomposition and initialize the drug and diseaseem bedding in the drug-similarity subspace, disease-similarity subspace, anddrug-disease association subspace, respectively. The representations of drugs and diseases are jointly captured in the corresponding subspace based on similarity and therapeutic associations. Moreover, the extent of the associations is measured through the graph attention mechanism to explore higher-order neighborhood relationships between drugs and diseases. Finally, we introduce a targeted residual connection for personalized propagation of node features. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our proposed architecture outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.

We present a design space for visualization with multiple scales. The design space includes three dimensions, with eight total subdimensions. We demonstrate its descriptive power by using it to code approaches from a corpus we compiled of 52 examples, created by a mix of academics and practitioners. We demonstrate descriptive power by analyzing and partitioning these examples into four high-level strategies for designing multiscale visualizations, which are shared approaches with respect to design space dimension choices. We demonstrate generative power by analyzing missed opportunities within the corpus of examples, identified through analysis of the design space, where we note how certain examples could have benefited from different choices. We discuss patterns in the use of different dimension and strategy choices in the different visualization contexts of analysis and presentation."

    "abstract": "The smart grid is a critical infrastructure that must function reliably in a geographically decentralized structure. However, this structure renders the smart grid vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, and data silos further limit the sharing of datasets needed to train an effective attack-detection model. Moreover, most existing methods rely on the availability of enormous amounts of labeled data, which is scarce due to the need for domain knowledge. To address these issues, we propose FedCLD, a federated contrastive learning approach for detecting stealthy attacks using unlabeled data. FedCLD leverages Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), a contrastive learning model, to enhance its ability to learn robust representations from unlabeled data. With the federated learning paradigm, FedCLD enables local centers in different areas to collaboratively train local models without sharing raw datasets. Although the global representation is enhanced, the regional characteristics should be preserved. Therefore, a strategic local update scheme based on the exponential moving average is proposed. Furthermore, we theoretically prove the convergence of FedCLD with this modified update strategy. Experiments are conducted in the industry-level PowerWorld simulator to evaluate the performance of FedCLD."

    "abstract": "The perfect order fulfillment rate (POF) is a key indicator in global logistics. Its decrease affects the accuracy and punctuality of shipments, negatively impacting customer satisfaction and operating costs. This article presents a case study of a Peruvian company that transports air cargo, which during 2023 reported an average POF of 93.9%, evidencing a 4 % gap with respect to the expected optimal level of 98%. The root causes are identified as: errors in cargo handling, inaccurate manual records, lack of order traceability, and incomplete dispatches, which ultimately generate penalties and reprocessing. Therefore, the article proposes a comprehensive model that combines emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) for real monitoring, complemented by the SCOR approach for process standardization, TPM, and SLP, to optimize logistics processes and improve the indicator. The proposal was validated through a simulation under real-life operating conditions, the results of which demonstrated a 97.84% increase in the indicator, demonstrating improvements in efficiency and error reduction. Based on the results, the solution is intended to be replicable not only in air cargo transport but also in other logistics sectors, helping to maximize the profitability and sustainability of operations."

    "abstract": "Traditional university research funding is frequently undermined by high transaction costs, bureaucratic friction, and information asymmetries that erode donor trust. Blockchain technology, particularly through smart contracts, offers a new paradigm for transparent and efficient fund management. This study investigates the practical viability of this paradigm by developing a decentralized funding platform and conducting a rigorous comparative performance analysis of two leading blockchain infrastructures: Ethereum's Sepolia testnet (a Layer 1 analogue) and Polygon's Amoy testnet (a Layer 2 solution). In 50 consecutive executions per network, the smart contract maintained 100% success on both, yet with Polygon maintaining an average confirmation time of 2.1 seconds versus Sepolia's 5.3 seconds. Furthermore, a preliminary usability study (N=20) confirms that users perceive the Polygon-based platform as significantly higher in performance and overall satisfaction. These findings provide robust quantitative and visual evidence that Layer 2 scaling solutions are not only viable but essential for creating decentralized applications that meet the practical requirements of speed, cost-efficiency, and positive user experience in domains like academic funding. This work contributes a critical empirical benchmark for the emerging field of Decentralized Science (DeSci) and offers a validated architectural model for transparent, automated, and globally accessible research financing."

While progress has been made in valuing contributions, such as target defence in security or on-ball performance in football (soccer), many aspects of performance, such as off-ball football actions, remain difficult to quantify. We introduce GAPP, a Graph Attention Network model that predicts football pass reception probabilities and provides interpretable insights into off-ball defending. Using attention mechanisms, GAPP captures player interactions and introduces two new metrics to quantify defender contributions. We tested GAPP on 306 English Premier League matches, and showed it reduces binary cross-entropy loss by 6.4 percent compared to multiple baselines for pass reception prediction, while offering unique insights for off-ball defender evaluation for coaches, scouts and teams. This work shows the potential of graph attention networks for analysing complex multi-agent systems like football."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a proposal aimed at improving the service level in the delivery of floating barges made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) at the Peruvian company SIGECO S.A.C., a project-based manufacturing company. The analysis identified the main obstacle as the poor performance of the OTIF (On Time In Full) indicator, caused by the lack of planning for distribution routes, insufficient logistics oversight, shortages of materials for final assembly, and delays in passing safety inspections. To address these challenges, the adoption of three technological tools aligned with Industry 4.0 principles is proposed: an IoT-enhanced Transportation Management System (TMS), the DDMRP methodology for materials planning, and the use of Digital Twins. The feasibility of the proposal was assessed through a quantitative analysis, the development of a technical design, and a review of its economic impact. The results showed improvements in the traceability of logistics operations, a reduction in assembly times, greater availability of input, and an increase in the level of customer service. In conclusion, the technical gap identified was mitigated, and the proposed solution demonstrates potential for replication in other industrial contexts with similar challenges in managing complex deliveries."

A combination of the RF (Random Forest) technique and packet size analysis to detect unusual behaviours and classify them as network intrusions was employed. Additionally, a CIAE risk matrix was applied to estimate the exposure degree of device-level vulnerabilities. That item stands for CIAE or confidentiality, integrity, availability and exploitability. On benchmark datasets, the recommended technique beat traditional models with 96.3% accuracy and 0.98 AUC. These results suggest combining strategies to improve IoT cybersecurity."

First of all, with the help of expert’s opinions (a group of 15 experts) and literature survey, the list of 20 drivers was created. In the next step, a systematically designed 5-Point Likert’s scale-based questionnaire, containing 20 drivers, was circulated to 250 respondents around the country for providing responses for investigating their intensity of importance. Based on their responses, reliability testing as well as identification of principal components, using principal component analysis, was accomplished. then, again a questionnaire was sent to the same group of 15 experts for investigating the importance of investigated 5 principal components, and their responses was fed to the DEMATEL algorithm, which yielded the degree of impotence of drivers as well as cause effect relationships among them. As the results of research work, principal components, Willingness to change, Skill factors, Technology factors, Organizational factors and financial factors were investigated along with their importance and relationships among them.

This study systematically reviews the development, structural typologies, and sectoral applications of solar trees, with a focus on their energy performance. A structured search was conducted using the PICO framework, and the selection of information sources followed the PRISMA guidelines, applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Forty studies published between 2019 and 2024 were selected from Scopus, EBSCOhost, and Google Scholar databases. The results revealed four main structural typologies (spiral, single-trunk with branches, flat, and spherical) with spiral models being the most prevalent. Among them, the 3/8 phyllotaxy design demonstrated up to 53.9% higher efficiency than conventional flat panels. Applications were predominantly found in the education sector (56%), followed by agriculture, urban infrastructure, residential areas, transportation, and healthcare. Most implementations were experimental, limiting large-scale deployment. A site-adapted design for Arequipa is proposed: a bifacial spiral solar tree on a 3/8 phyllotaxis helix with a seasonal tilt gradient, passive trunk ventilation, and low-energy automation. In conclusion, solar trees offer significant potential for energy generation in limited spaces and diverse contexts, but further research is needed to standardize performance evaluations and promote their adoption across sectors."

To explore the neural dynamics of this process, we conducted a controlled experiment with 35 developers performing merge tasks in two representational formats—sentential (Java code) and diagrammatic (UML class diagrams)—while EEG was continuously recorded. We clustered EEG signals into the four canonical microstate classes (A–D), which are well-established in cognitive neuroscience and represent recurring large-scale brain activity patterns. In alternating cycles of eyes-closed rest and task execution, we analyzed microstate dynamics and found diametrically opposite patterns depending on representation: in the sentential format, microstates A, C, and D increased significantly in duration, occurrence, and coverage, whereas in the diagrammatic format, A and C decreased, B declined moderately, and D showed reductions in occurrence and coverage. These findings reinforce the feasibility of microstate metrics as fine-grained biomarkers of cognitive overload in model-integration operations, paving the way for cognitively aware tools and adaptive environments capable of automatically adjusting abstraction levels or issuing high-load alerts."

    "abstract": "Course recommendation systems (CRS) are essential tools that help university students navigate their academic journey and select appropriate courses. Most of the existing models function as black boxes, offering little transparency in their recommendations. This lack of explainability reduces students' trust and willingness to adopt these systems, as they often want to understand the reasoning behind course suggestions. To address this issue, we introduce a knowledge graph-enhanced explainable course recommendation framework to provide personalized course recommendations to students in the upcoming semester. Our model, GGCR, integrates multiple techniques, including feature (keywords) extraction from course descriptions, graph attention networks (GAT) to build high-quality embeddings, and gated recurrent units (GRU) to capture session-based and sequential patterns over multiple semesters. We also explore the explainability capabilities of the best-performing models. We utilize course embeddings to offer course-similarity-based explanations. In addition, using the attention weights of the GAT module, our approach provides more detailed path reasoning-based explanations for each recommendation. In our experiments, conducted on real-world data, the proposed GGCR model not only exceeds existing state-of-the-art models in performance but also enhances explainability. This highlights that explainability does not have to come at the cost of accuracy. Furthermore, we assess the quality of different types of explanations using the Fidelity measure, large language models (LLMs), and human experts to ensure that our framework provides meaningful and interpretable recommendations."

This research examines TDD, a programming process that involves creating test cases prior to implementing code, using an orderly Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Modern strategy utilizes two techniques: a mathematical modeling structure that assesses the quantity of defects experienced whether or not it utilizes TDD, and the organizational diagram which graphically depicts how TDD operates. The case presents a scenario along with 100 software functions to demonstrate that TDD can reduce the number of problems from 10% to 5%. This reduces the bug count by half. A regular testing-feedback loop helps this outcome by guaranteeing code correctness and encouraging early error investigation. The study shows that TDD improves program security and code quality and maintainability. The results presented here give an excellent rationale to add TDD to the way software engineers work now, and they also help the organization learn more about the way agile methods work recently."

The phantom combines accessible materials such as paraffin gel, distilled water, glycerin, and silicone tubing to mimic the acoustic properties of biological tissue and blood flow. Additionally, it incorporates an automated flow control system for Doppler testing. Test results on five different sonographs demonstrate that the phantom can effectively evaluate parameters such as spatial resolution, image uniformity, measurement accuracy, and velocity in Doppler mode. With an estimated manufacturing cost of $186, this prototype represents a viable alternative to commercial phantoms, which can cost around $3,000. Opportunities for improvement include adding more complex vascular structures and evaluating pulsed flow.

Using the island's abundant solar energy potential, residential rooftops were analyzed using Google Earth and PVWatts software to identify feasible photovoltaic installations. The findings reveal that rooftop systems can generate 2 to 3 times more energy than residential consumption, allowing excess energy to be shared with the central grid or neighboring users. To design the microgrids, various software tools, including the Microgrid Design Toolkit (MDT), were utilized to achieve a balance between technical performance and economic feasibility. This study highlights how these microgrids could enhance grid resilience, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Future work will further quantify the economic and environmental benefits of implementing these systems, supporting Puerto Rico's transition to a sustainable energy model."

    "abstract": "With their increase in performance, neural network architectures also become more complex, necessitating explainability. Therefore, many new and improved methods are currently emerging, which often generate so-called saliency maps in order to improve interpretability. Those methods are often evaluated by visual expectations, yet this typically leads towards a confirmation bias. Due to a lack of a general metric for explanation quality, non-accessible ground truth data about the model's reasoning and the large amount of involved assumptions, multiple works claim to find flaws in those methods. However, this often leads to unfair comparison metrics. Additionally, the complexity of most datasets (mostly images or text) is often so high, that approximating all possible explanations is not feasible. For those reasons, this paper introduces a test for saliency map evaluation: proposing controlled experiments based on all possible model reasonings over multiple simple logical datasets. Using the contained logical relationships, we aim to understand how different saliency methods handle information in different class discriminative scenarios (e.g., via complementary and redundant information). By introducing multiple new metrics, we analyse propositional logical patterns towards a non-informative attribution score baseline to find deviations of typical expectations. Our results show that saliency methods can encode classification relevant information into the ordering of saliency scores, resulting in unreliable interpretations."

Analysis of data related to a person’s vitals is crucial as it may give insights into the well-being of a person. However, processed data required for analysis in a computing system like edge/cloud requires a connection to the internet and data communicated over the channel; the data that gets communicated between these devices, as a result of the cloud, raises significant security, privacy, and compliance concerns. To address all the issues presented above, this paper proposes a robust framework that, when implemented, will significantly enhance data transfer security between wearable devices and the cloud and provide data security through encryption techniques and authentication mechanisms at every stage. To enhance protection against possible threats from harmful attacks and unauthorized access, the framework incorporates multiple security layers, featuring compliance, regulations for secure data storage, and fully verified encryption from end to end. Amid rising cybersecurity threats, the promising implications of this framework provide optimism and a beacon of hope."

    "abstract": "The early detection of mechanical faults in three-phase induction motors is essential for enhancing operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs. This study presents a simulation-based methodology for fault diagnosis using supervised machine learning, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs). A 3 HP, 220 V, 60 Hz induction motor was modeled in Simulink, including detailed electrical and mechanical dynamics. Two types of mechanical failures—rotor imbalance and bearing defects—were simulated through controlled perturbations in torque and stiffness. From the resulting vibration and temperature signals, a total of 15 time, frequency, and thermal domain features were extracted in segmented windows. The classification model was trained on a synthetic dataset comprising 300 labeled samples representing three motor conditions: healthy, imbalance, and bearing failure. Using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, the SVM classifier was optimized via cross-validation and Bayesian search. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 96.7% on the test set, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 1.00 for all classes. The results demonstrate high diagnostic performance, even with a limited and entirely simulated dataset. This work validates the feasibility of using SVMs for accurate fault classification in induction motors based solely on vibration and temperature features. Although tested in a simulated environment, the method shows promising potential for future real-time implementation in predictive maintenance systems. Future work will focus on experimental validation and integration of additional signal types, such as motor current, to improve robustness and extend applicability to real industrial scenarios."

For early and precise categorization, automated solutions are required because traditional detection techniques are time consuming and prone to mistakes. This paper proposes an automated system for classifying soyabean leaves as either healthy or infested utilizing GoogleNet, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM. According to the test results, GoogleNet outperformed Random Forest(97%), KNN(96%) and SVM(90%), achieving the highest accuracy of 98%. This shows how much deep learning models have improved in accurately detecting pests. By automating early infestation detection, decreasing reliance on manual inspection, and improving pest control tactics, the suggested approach improves precision agriculture.

Standard diagnostic methods are based on cognitive assessment, imaging, and clinical examination, each of which are costly and time-consuming. In this research, a new method is introduced for utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHR) in the early diagnosis of AD. For the identification of relevant biomarkers in unstructured as well as structured EHRs like patient history, demographics, administered medication, and cognitive tests, the proposed method integrates ML with feature selection methods. The study utilizes a hybrid approach that integrates Transformer-based natural language processing for structured data and ensemble learning for processing text-based information. Experimental results on a large-scale EHR dataset illustrate that our model is superior to conventional ML methods in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The proposed system provides a scalable and interpretable solution for physicians for the early detection to facilitate timely interventions."

    "abstract": "Emotion is an important state of the human body with respect to neurological and physiological changes to human thought, feelings and behaviors. Especially human emotion is determined easily through conversations and behaviors. Thus recognizing human emotion in the conversation becomes significant to multiple key applications in healthcare, education and entertainment. Particularly recognizing human emotions on the video contents is gaining more attention in education and entertainment domain in large extent. Recognizing human emotions of the video content are performed with respect to multiple modalities in form of speech, gesture and facial expressions. Traditionally many researches has performed using natural language processing model and computer vision approaches through deep learning and machine learning for relationship modeling of the multimodal emotions with high scalability and reliability. Despite of several advantages, those architectures produces multiple challenges in feature aggregation of the multimodal features and feature alignment according to the emotion classes. In order to manage those challenges, new multimodal emotion recognition architecture is designed using graph convolution network and long short term memory network to aggregate multimodal feature and recognize the aggregated features emotion state. Initially pretrained model is used to extract the audio and video features of the cross model sequential data effectively. Graph Convolution Network is highly efficient in processing sequential data effectively with less parameter. Graph Convolution Network processes the visual features and audio features of multimodal dataset in form of graph structured data as node and edge. Node represents audio features and visual features and edge represents relationship between features. Transformed Graph data is processed in graph convolution layer on utilizing filter to learn features of the each sequence with its neighbor sequence to aggregate the similar features to be represented as feature embedding. Feature embedding of visual features and audio features in form candidate activation vector in long short term memory network. Fully connected layer of the model uses activation function to aggregate the visual and audio features as fusion mechanism with feature normalization. Finally softmax function of the fully connected layer using support vector machine to recognize emotion and classifies the particular emotions to available emotion class label. Extensive experiment and performance analysis of the current graph convolution network with long short term model is performed using benchmark dataset referred as CMU-Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) dataset. On performance analysis, current model attains 98.7% accuracy which is found to be higher than conventional approaches. Finally proposed architecture is highly effective in identifying speaker emotions and further it improves stability of the emotion analysis on fusing richer feature information."

Our contribution is structured around three axes: the validation of an assistance system by clinical experts, the evaluation of potential biases during the use of AI tools in interventional pulmonology, and concrete recommendations for the design of medical diagnostic support interfaces.

As many system components will have exceeded their expected lifetimes, the risks of failure, system degradation, and obsolescence increase, ultimately compromising operational performance and safety. Although preventive maintenance is regularly performed on the EE facilities, an extensive consolidation program of these facilities has started, to improve their dependability and assure their performance till the end of operation of the LHC. This paper illustrates the two projects of consolidation of the 600 A and 13 kA EE systems, which aim to modernize and optimize these systems, ensuring that they continue to provide reliable protection while reducing maintenance costs and integrating the latest advances in materials, control technologies, and diagnostics, together with enhanced safety."

    "abstract": "Surgical workflow prediction is critical for enhancing safety and providing real-time guidance in Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS), particularly in laparoscopic and Robot-Assisted Surgery (RAS). We propose a novel visual information-based method for predicting surgical workflows at fine temporal scales. Our model adopts a two-stage training strategy. First, a ResNet50 backbone is trained to extract robust spatial features from individual surgical frames. Then, a predictive network is trained on sequential features. This network integrates a novel Temporal Feature Recorder (TFR) module, which aggregates both local and global temporal information from observed frame sequences, together with a Cross-Attention mechanism that fuses these temporal features with spatial information. A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) subsequently leverages this aggregated spatiotemporal representation to predict future feature states and corresponding workflow classifications. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS (activity level) and Cholec80 (phase level) datasets. It achieves superior classification accuracy (60.37%), significantly outperforming baselines on JIGSAWS, and delivers competitive accuracy (85.73%) with the lowest prediction error (MAE: 0.3672, MSE: 0.2148) on Cholec80 compared to existing baselines."

Experimental validation confirms that the proposed topology achieves high efficiency and improved voltage and current waveforms. It also reduces common-mode voltage while decreasing the number of power devices and the overall system volume and cost relative to conventional fully GaN-based multilevel converters. Additionally, since operating GaN devices at high switching frequencies (above <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50-100 kHz</i>) in vehicular applications is counterproductive, as it increases switching losses without significantly improving the quality of voltage and current waveforms, a relatively low switching frequency is adopted for GaN devices to exploit their full potential in improving efficiency."

    "abstract": "Dual-polarized microwave and millimeter-wave shared-aperture antennas with differential feedings based on a single-layer substrate are proposed. In the microwave band, the orthogonal degenerated modes of a square patch are differentially excited to generate a dual-polarized radiation. The polarization isolation is realized by diagonal splits and short-circuit pins, and the latter could also simply transform the dual-band operation into a wideband one. In both cases, high gain and high polarization isolation performance are attained for the differentially-fed dual-polarized microwave patch antennas. The characteristics of the electric field distribution of the patch working modes show some weak field areas which can be used for more functions without influence on the microwave part. In the millimeter-wave band, a cross-shaped substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity is constructed, and orthogonal slot arrays are etched on the SIW structure, which are fed by differential feedings to achieve a dual-polarized wideband radiation. The deformation of the SIW cavity and the slots increases the polarization isolation and improves the impedance matching, respectively. The millimeter-wave part is accordingly embedded into the region where the electric field of the patch is weak, forming two different aperture-shared antennas. The operations in different bands are almost independent of each other. The isolation between antennas is higher than 45 dB, due to the embedding position selection and the inherent shielding of the SIW structure. Finally, prototypes of the proposed differentially-fed dual-polarized micro- and millimeter-wave shared-aperture antennas based on single-layer substrate are designed and implemented for validation."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is widely used in mobile computing as a communication-efficient distributed machine learning (ML) paradigm; however, it faces challenges such as model convergence to local optima or slow convergence due to the heterogeneity of client data. To mitigate data heterogeneity, the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method demonstrates its effectiveness by predictively updating the gradient to improve system performance. However, the performance of NAG depends heavily on the choice of decay coefficients; larger coefficients have greater acceleration but may lead to an unstable convergence process due to their unreasonable prediction of the descent gradient. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the first radical heavy ball (RHB) method that combines momentum and NAG. In Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), momentum stabilizes the gradient descent process by integrating the historical gradients to update the parameters, and the RHB strategy decouples a single decay coefficient into an NAG component and a momentum component. The RHB introduces a gradient recall after each gradient acceleration by the NAG to strengthen the NAG's perception of the historical gradients, thus stabilizing the gradient descent process. By weighing the historical gradients and the predicted gradient, RHB effectively mitigates the instability of NAG convergence and demonstrates better performance. As a result, the algorithm further mitigates the impact of customer data heterogeneity in FL and can effectively deliver global update information to participants without additional communication costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments in a binary function, single node, and federated model environment to analyze the convergence properties in non-convex loss functions. RHB exhibits better performance and less computational overhead than many existing algorithms."

Key advantages of this technique include the minimal additional component requirements for cost efficiency, strong noise immunity, and high precision.

In this paper, we develop a RIS-based measurement platform for simultaneous channel measurement and link-level performance analysis, followed by verification and validation in a laboratory environment. Utilizing this platform, we conduct wideband channel measurement and performance analysis work in indoor scenarios at 2.6 GHz band. Multiple RIS phase shift codebooks are employed, including the 1-bit discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook, the Ring-type codebook, and the conditional sample mean (CSM) codebook. Based on these measurements, two empirical path loss (PL) models, namely the floating-intercept (FI) model and the close-in (CI) model, are fitted to the measured data. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze and compare the channel characteristics of RIS-assisted communications, including shadow fading (SF), multipath components (MPCs) statistics, the Rician K-factor (KF), and root mean square (RMS) delay spread. Finally, we evaluate and compare the wireless coverage and link-level performance of various RIS reflection schemes.

In short-range horizons (1–4 weeks) the best ARIMA configuration achieved <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}=0.9707$</tex> and MAE = 88.7 cases, outperforming neural networks by 5–8 %, whereas LSTM models captured medium-term, non-linear trends when multiple climate variables were included. All models are deployed in a lightweight Streamlit dashboard that generates forecasts, heat maps and downloadable artefacts for local health offices. The study confirms that well-tuned statistical baselines can equal or surpass deep networks in data-scarce settings, while hybrid strategies offer a practical path toward early-warning systems in underserved areas."

    "abstract": "Behavioral model diagrams, e.g., sequence diagrams, are an essential form of documentation that are typically designed by system engineers from requirements documentation, either fully manually or assisted by design tools. With the growing use of Large Language Models (LLM) as AI modeling assistants, more automation will be involved in generating diagrams. This necessitates the advancement of automatic model correctness evaluation tools. Such a tool can be used to evaluate both manually and AI automatically generated models; to provide feedback to system engineers, and enable AI assistants to self-evaluate and self-enhance their generated models. In this paper, we propose MCeT, the first fully automated tool to evaluate the correctness of a behavioral model, sequence diagrams in particular, against its corresponding requirements text and produce a list of issues that the model has. We utilize LLMs for the correctness evaluation tasks as they have shown outstanding natural language understanding ability. However, we show that directly asking an LLM to compare a diagram to requirements finds less than 35% of issues that experienced engineers can find. We propose to supplement the direct check with a fine-grained, multi-perspective approach; we split the diagram into atomic, non-divisible interactions, and split the requirements text into atomic, self-contained items. We compare the diagram with atomic requirements and each diagramatom with the requirements. We also propose a self-consistency checking approach that combines perspectives to mitigate LLM hallucinated issues. Our combined approach improves upon the precision of the direct approach from 0.58 to 0.81 in a dataset of real requirements. Moreover, the approach finds 90% more issues that the experienced engineers found than the direct approach, and reports an average of 6 new issues per diagram."

    "abstract": "Hand gesture recognition technology has become a crucial innovation in assistive technology, providing enhanced accessibility and independence for individuals with disabilities. In order to enhance communication, mobility, and rehabilitation support, this paper investigates the development and integration of AI-powered gesture recognition systems with wearable devices, augmented reality (AR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The adaptability and ease of use of the current solutions, such as sign language interpretation and smart prosthetics, are severely limited. We propose a novel framework that combines cloud-based data storage, haptic feedback mechanisms, and real-time AI processing to create a highly responsive and personalized user experience to fill in these gaps. The research focuses on accuracy, responsiveness, and ease of use during its comprehensive analysis of prototype testing data and user feedback. The system is able to continually improve the accuracy of gesture recognition and adapt to the requirements of each user by making use of deep learning algorithms. The study also emphasizes the possibility of incorporating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for improved control and responsiveness. By providing individualized therapeutic exercises and real-time feedback, our findings suggest that incorporating gesture-controlled interfaces into rehabilitation programs can significantly benefit stroke patients and individuals with motor impairments. Gesture-based smart home control is also made possible by IoT connectivity, which makes life easier for people with limited mobility. An assessment of the system’s impact, obstacles to widespread adoption, and potential future directions for improving AI models and making them more affordable are presented at the study’s conclusion. The goal of this study is to help close the digital divide for people with disabilities and contribute to the ongoing development of accessible technology."

Previous methods typically decompose the task into separate steps such as symbol detection and line detection, which can limit their ability to capture the structure in these diagrams. In this work, a transformer-based approach leveraging the Relationformer that addresses this limitation by jointly extracting symbols and their interconnections from P&IDs is introduced. To evaluate our approach and compare it to a modular digitization approach, we present the first publicly accessible benchmark dataset for P&ID digitization, annotated with graph-level ground truth. Experimental results on real-world diagrams show that our method significantly outperforms the modular baseline, achieving over 25 % improvement in edge detection accuracy. This research contributes a reproducible evaluation framework and demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer models for structural understanding of complex engineering diagrams.

To categorise and predict the incidence of pests using data acquired by sensors, the system employs supervised learning techniques such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Logistic Regression. Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were the primary performance indicators used in the extensive assessments. Random Forest outperformed the other models we looked at, with an accuracy of 85% and much lower error rates (MSE: 0.4, MAE: 0.16, RMSE: 0.63) than any of the others. AdaBoost came in second. The findings provide a solid and trustworthy decision-support tool for farmers, highlighting the efficacy of ensemble learning methods in agricultural prediction tasks.

However, a fast sampling approach under the kernel-based assumption is still missing in this field, that can further improve the reconstruction performance. In this paper, we will propose an eigen-decomposition-free (ED-free) sampling method for general kernel-based graph signals. We first define graph signals as vectors in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and then introduce an explicit kernel-based recovery method. Then, we focus on the A-optimal sampling function on submatrix of a constantly shifted kernel matrix to stabilize the recovery performance. For fast optimization, we define node-dependent vectors called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">localized graph filter impulse responses</i> (LogFIRs)—the impulse responses of square root of kernel matrix, which can be estimated fast without ED. Using these vectors, we reformulate our sampling objective and develop a low-complexity algorithm to evaluate nodes via only simple scalar multiplications. Further, we find that the proposed algorithm tends to sample nodes whose supported LogFIRs are as orthogonal as possible. Besides, we prove that our proposed sampling method can improve the recovery performance of graph signals under bandlimited and smooth models via exquisitely choosing specific kernels. Finally, extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world graph signals have validated that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art execution time and has superior reconstruction performance compared to other deterministic sampling alternatives."

In the context of Ethereum smart contracts, where addressing vulnerabilities before deployment is essential, several studies have begun exploring LLM-based vulnerability repair. These studies typically evaluate repair methods on publicly available contracts. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in fixing vul-nerabilities in previously unseen contracts remains unclear. To address this question, we applied an obfuscation technique to simulate unknown contracts and used Code Llama - Instruct and GPT-3.S Turbo to attempt automated repairs. We collected 11 publicly available vulnerable contracts and generated obfuscated versions of each to simulate previously unseen contracts. We then evaluated the performance of the LLMs on both sets. Code Llama - Instruct successfully repaired one original contract and four obfuscated ones. In contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo correctly fixed seven contracts in each group. These results suggest that LLMs are capable of consistently addressing vulnerabilities in both existing and obfuscated (i.e., simulated unknown) contracts."

A significant increase is shown by quantitative data, with switching contrast ratios improved by up to 25% and transmission efficiency surpassing conventional standards by more than 15%.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation, and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or machine learning knowledge."

Under such conditions, image quality is often compromised by noise, reduced detail, and low visibility, severely limiting the system's ability to perceive and interact with the environment. In this work, we propose ALLIE, an innovative deep neural network model based on an Autoencoder architecture, designed specifically for enhancing images taken in low-light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manual adjustment of brightness, contrast, or noise filtering, ALLIE performs enhancement automatically through end-to-end learning. The network learns to transform dark images into well-exposed versions by capturing complex image representations that improve clarity while preserving important scene details. We evaluated the proposed method on the paired Low-Light (LOL) image dataset, in both versions v1 and v2, using reference-based quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM to quantify fidelity between enhanced images and their corresponding groundtruths. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLIE outperforms conventional and state-of-the-art approaches, producing images with superior visual quality, which are suitable for diverse applications in robotics and computer vision."

    "abstract": "Recommendation systems have emerged as an integral part of various domains, such as e-commerce, social media, and streaming services, by providing personalized content suggestions. Traditional approaches, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering encounter difficulties such scalability issues, cold start issues, and sparse data. In order to overcome these constraints, this research suggests an Adaptive Stochastic Graph Propagation Network model, integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Adaptive Graph Augmented Learning (AGAL) to refine user-product embeddings and enhance recommendation accuracy. The proposed method leverages graph-based learning and Adaptive Graph Augmented Learning (AGAL) techniques to propagate information across user-item interaction networks, effectively capturing high-order connections. To enhance the quality of graph structure and ensure meaningful propagation in the Adaptive Stochastic Graph Propagation Network (ASGAN), we incorporate a robust edge selection mechanism through Adaptive Graph Augmented Learning (AGAL). AGAL leverages a combination of node centrality-based heuristics to guide the graph augmentation process by identifying which edges should be retained, reweighted, or pruned prior to diffusion-based learning Additionally, a hybrid loss function combining Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss and graph-regularization techniques is introduced to improve ranking performance and ensure better model generalization. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets, including Amazon-Books, Yelp2018, and Gowalla, demonstrate that the suggested model performs noticeably better than conventional and state-of-the-art recommendation models in terms of recall and predictive accuracy. The results highlight the model's ability to provide more reliable and personalized recommendations while maintaining computational efficiency, making it a promising approach for real-world recommendation applications."

In particular, the above also implies the same near-maximum circuit lower bounds for Σ2E∩Π2E and ZPENP. Our proofs relativise. Previously, only “half-exponential” circuit lower bounds for the aforementioned complexity classes were known, and the smallest complexity class known to require exponential circuit complexity was Δ3E=EΣ2P (Miltersen, Vinodchandran, and Watanabe COCOON’99)."

    "abstract": "Zero-shot 3D visual grounding (ZS-3DVG) refers to the task of grounding an object within a 3D scene based on a natural-language description, particularly for categories unseen during training. In this task, color serves as a crucial cue, but its use is hindered by challenges in both accuracy and speed. Accuracy is degraded by the instability of the RGB color space under varying illumination and the semantic gap between the standard color definitions and human perception. Speed is hampered by the computational overhead of rendering 3D point clouds into multiple 2D views. Although more views can improve color recognition, this incurs substantial latency, making real-time applications infeasible. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight module that enhances both speed and accuracy. With respect to speed, our module bypasses the rendering pipeline and operates directly on HSV histograms extracted from 3D point clouds, significantly reducing the computation. For accuracy, our module leverages a key property of the HSV color space: chromatic colors concentrate along the hue axis, whereas achromatic colors lie on the value axis. Based on this, we mitigate the RGB instability by routing the input data to specialized classifiers focusing on the relevant axis. Furthermore, we resolved the semantic mismatch by grouping perceptually similar colors. The experimental results show that our method achieves higher accuracy and faster inference than RGB- or CLIP-based baselines, enabling robust and efficient color recognition in ZS-3DVG."

    "abstract": "With the rapid expansion of wind farms worldwide, effective monitoring of numerous wind turbines has become essential. Abnormal data cleaning in wind power curves is crucial for wind farm operation and maintenance, as it often influences turbine fault detection and extreme condition analysis. This paper proposes a knowledge- and data-joint-driven model for wind power abnormal data cleaning. Existing methods can be broadly classified into two categories: knowledge-driven (KD) and data-driven (DD) approaches. The former relies on explicit features extracted through subjective experience, which limits data cleaning performance, whereas the latter depends on implicit features that are sensitive to the quantity and quality of recorded data. Therefore, a multi-constraint-guided, knowledge- and data-joint-driven convolutional neural network (MC-CNN) is proposed to integrate the robustness of KD methods and the learning ability of DD models through a joint training process. Furthermore, a multi-attention (MA) mechanism is introduced to fuse explicit and implicit features, thereby improving feature discrimination compared with conventional concatenation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an accuracy exceeding 92%, with a root mean square error (RMSE) comparable to real wind power curves after cleaning. Compared with existing techniques, the proposed approach demonstrates significant improvement, even when applied to small-sample wind power curves."

    "abstract": "This article presents an inertially stabilized platform (ISP) based on a spherical joint and direct spherical driving. Unlike conventional ISPs primarily based on multiframe gimbals and single-axis motors, the three-DOF orientation of the proposed ISP is directly actuated by electromagnetic driving modules distributed on spherical shells. This direct-drive configuration eliminates complex mechanical linkages, significantly reduces system inertia, avoids gimbal singularities, and enables faster dynamic response. The kinematic and dynamic models, as well as the driving models, are derived for the direct-drive ISP. An optical sensing method for simultaneously detecting the three-DOF rotational motion of the rotor with respect to the stator is proposed, ensuring high-precision motion detection. To precisely control the three-DOF orientation in the presence of external disturbances and model uncertainties, a complementary control method is formulated for stabilizing the rotor of the ISP, which integrates H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub> control and H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sub> control in a complementary means to ensure robustness while maintaining optimal performance by avoiding conservativeness in traditional robust control methods. The gimbal-free structure with constant inertia parameters of the DSD-ISP also enables the full benefit of model-based control, which is less practical for traditional gimbal ISPs due to their changing inertial configurations and complex frame coupling. The conceptual feasibility of the proposed ISP has been validated through both numerical simulations and experimental tests. The performance of the proposed system has been compared to that of a conventional gimbal-based ISP, which demonstrates superior performance in both tracking accuracy as well as driving efficiency."

Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet, a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout, enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions. CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios."

Consequently, it exerts a substantial influence on an individual's physical and psychological state, directly or indirectly affecting the evolutionary dynamics of a population described by a network, which in turn can also alter the environment. Furthermore, the evolution of strategies, shaped by reputation, can diverge due to variations in multiple factors. To explore the potential consequences of the mentioned situations, this paper studies how game and reputation dynamics alter the evolution of cooperation. Concretely, game transitions are determined by individuals' behaviors and external uncontrollable factors. The cooperation level of its neighbors reflects individuals' reputation, and further, a general fitness function regarding payoff and reputation is provided. Within the context of the donation game, we investigate the relevant outcomes associated with the aforementioned evolutionary process, considering various topologies for distinct interactions. Additionally, a biased mutation is introduced to gain a deeper insight into the strategy evolution.We detect a substantial increase in the cooperation level through intensive simulations, and some important phenomena are observed, e.g., the unilateral increase of the value of prosocial behavior has limited promotion in cooperative behavior in square-lattice networks."

    "abstract": "Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a novel tomographic imaging technique with high sensitivity and high temporal resolution. Reconstruction methods based on the system matrix (SM) enable accurate estimation of the concentration distribution of magnetic nanoparticles. However, SM calibration measurement is highly time-consuming, and the SM needs to be recalibrated whenever the scan parameters, particle types, or even the particle environment change. Although previous studies have proposed methods to accelerate SM calibration, these approaches do not fully exploit the similarity between the two-dimensional (2D) SMs of adjacent slices. In this study, we propose a multi-slice knowledge-driven SM calibration method, MKD-SM, which leverages knowledge obtained from multiple adjacent x-y slices to improve SM calibration accuracy at high downsampling ratios. Specifically, based on the significant similarity of the 2D SMs from adjacent x-y slices, MKD-SM employs a cross-misaligned sampling method to obtain the low-resolution (LR) SM within the field of view (FOV), ensuring that the 2D LR SMs obtained from adjacent slices exhibit complementarity. Additionally, we use a federated affinity fusion method to aggregate the complementary knowledge across multiple adjacent slices and utilize an architecture based on a cascade of CNNs and transformers for high-resolution (HR) SM recovery. Experimental results on the public OpenMPI dataset demonstrate that MKD-SM outperforms existing calibration methods, achieving higher SM calibration accuracy, particularly at high downsampling ratios. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of leveraging knowledge from adjacent slices. Furthermore, the proposed method has been successfully applied to an in-house field-free line (FFL) MPI scanner, enabling HR image reconstruction with LR SM measurements."

    "abstract": "Demand Aggregators (DAs) are expected to have a continuously increasing impact in the operation of modern electricity markets. Such players tend to concentrate large portfolios of demand-side resources, leading to market power concentration and imperfect competition. Such imperfectly competitive markets are analyzed in the literature by studying their equilibria. However, little attention has been given to the learning dynamics through which players adapt their bidding strategies over time and, crucially, to which equilibria are actually learnable. In this paper, we propose the coarse-correlated equilibrium as a solution concept that is more relevant than the Nash equilibrium for such markets. In contrast to the typical approach of the literature on Equilibrium Problems with Equilibrium Constraints, we model the learning dynamics that strategic DAs use to gradually optimize their bidding strategies. At the same time, in contrast to generic model-free approaches, we account for the fact that market players would make better use of the markets’ available information by explicitly modeling their competitors. To that end, we propose a game-theoretic learning algorithm, in which each strategic DA observes the bids of its competitors and gradually builds beliefs about their bidding strategies. The resulting equilibria are compared to the pure Nash equilibria of the related literature. Our numerical results demonstrate that, in practice, strategic DAs can manipulate prices and market conditions to a greater extent than previously anticipated for the benefit of the energy system as a whole."

We present a sparse prototype-based framework for deepfake detection that integrates class-specific dictionary learning with high-capacity face embeddings from the InceptionResNetV2 backbone. Discriminative dictionaries for real and manipulated faces are learned, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit is employed to encode sparse representations. Classification decisions are derived from reconstruction residuals and sparse coefficient patterns, enabling transparent, traceable predictions. The proposed method is evaluated on Celeb-DF and five FaceForensics++ manipulation subsets, including FaceShifter, NeuralTexture, DeepFakes, FaceSwap, and Face2Face. It achieves up to 98.21% accuracy on FaceSwap and 92.05% on Celeb-DF, demonstrating competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep architectures while maintaining moderate computational cost. Beyond accuracy, the framework offers intrinsic interpretability by linking predictions to semantically meaningful prototypes, making it particularly suitable for forensic and high-stakes verification scenarios."

    "abstract": "Spectral computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technology that utilizes the absorption characteristics of different X-ray energies to obtain the X-ray attenuation characteristics of objects in different energy ranges. However, the limited number of photons detected by spectral CT under a specific X-ray spectrum leads to obvious projection data noise. Making full use of the various properties of the original data is an effective way to recover a clean image from a small amount of noisy projection data. This paper proposes a spectral CT reconstruction method based on representative coefficient image denoising under a low-rank decomposition framework. This method integrates model-driven internal low-rank and nonlocal priors, and data-driven external deep priors, aiming to fully exploit the inherent spectral correlation, nonlocal self-similarity and deep spatial features in spectral CT images. Specifically, we use low-rank decomposition to characterize the global low-rankness of spectral CT images under a plug-and-play framework, and jointly utilize nonlocal low-rankness and smoothness as well as deep image priors to denoise representative coefficient images. Therefore, the proposed method faithfully represents the real underlying information of images by cleverly combining internal and external, nonlocal and local priors. Meanwhile, we design an effective proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm to solve the proposed reconstruction model and establish the theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that compared with existing popular algorithms, the proposed method can significantly reduce running time while improving spectral CT images quality."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an effective solution for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To maintain data freshness, the age of information (AoI) has become a key performance metric, which is jointly influenced by UAV trajectory planning and sensor node (SN) scheduling. However, optimizing these two interdependent tasks simultaneously leads to high-dimensional decision spaces and unstable learning dynamics. To solve this problem, we propose a two-layered reinforcement learning framework for AoI-aware trajectory planning and scheduling optimization, named TL-RATS. In the upper layer, a reinforcement learning module is designed to learn long-term UAV trajectories by using the agent-by-agent policy optimization (A2PO) algorithm, enhanced by sequential updates and preceding-agent off-policy correction (PreOPC) to ensure sample-efficient and stable learning. In the lower layer, we formulate the scheduling problem as a time-constrained 0-1 knapsack optimization, where each item’s weight represents data collection and transmission time, and its value corresponds to potential AoI reduction. A lightweight dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to allocate transmission opportunities under time constraints. Extensive experiments under diverse SN distributions demonstrate that TL-RATS significantly reduces AoI and outperforms representative baselines, including MAPPO, IPPO, MAT, greedy scheduling, and fully joint policy. These results highlight the benefits of the proposed layered design and task-specific coordination."

However, current MCTS algorithms implicitly assume that agents are always available and actively contributing throughout the mission. In realistic, dynamic, and volatile environments, agent attrition is common and can severely degrade performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that agent attrition can cause current decentralized MCTS methods to perform arbitrarily worse than the optimum, particularly in applications with submodular reward functions. To address this issue, we propose Attritable Monte Carlo Tree Search (A-MCTS), a decentralized MCTS algorithm that adapts quickly and efficiently to reductions in the set of active agents. Our key idea is to have each agent build its search tree using the global utility function while coordinating with teammates through a regret-matching algorithm. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that A-MCTS maintains effective coordination among agents, even in high-attrition environments. We evaluate our approach in different information-gathering problems by modeling realistic reference scenarios. Results highlight that A-MCTS substantially improves over the main competing methods regarding global utility, scalability, and robustness."

Addressing the urgent need for continuous connectivity maintenance, this study proposes a topology reconstruction method based on multi-objective optimization to enhance the resilience of unmanned cluster networks. To achieve targeted topology repair, this study integrates a TOPSIS-based multi-attribute decision-making framework incorporating four topological centrality metrics—degree centrality, closeness centrality, K-shell, and eigenvector centrality—to accurately identify critical nodes and overcome the limitations of single-metric evaluations Combined with a coverage hole detection mechanism, this study constructs a cube-shaped detection region and realizes precise localization of network damage through geometric analysis of boundary intersection points, thereby reliably identifying coverage voids induced by node failures. A comprehensive multi-objective optimization model is formulated to simultaneously maximize network coverage, minimize energy consumption, and improve link stability, effectively balancing the inherent trade-offs among these objectives. The model is efficiently solved using an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts learning factors to avoid premature convergence. Extensive NS-3 simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms MCMF and PSO-VD. Specifically, it achieves 11.07% higher network coverage compared with MCMF and 7.11% higher compared with PSO-VD, while reducing the movement distance of repair nodes by 4.07% relative to MCMF and 8.39% relative to PSO-VD.

    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but lacking data used for training LLMs."

    "abstract": "In data-driven research within Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), the extraction of conceptual models, such as UML diagrams, from software repositories is a crucial step for analyzing software design, evolution, and quality. However, these extracted models often contain inconsistencies, redundancies, and noise because most model repositories are not curated. Without effective data cleansing, the reliability of empirical and machine learning (ML)-based MDE studies working with these repositories is seriously threatened. This paper proposes a data cleansing pipeline designed to effectively cleanse model repositories. Our approach systematically addresses common data quality issues by offering a sequence of automated pre-processing, validation, and filtering steps based on rule-based heuristics and ML techniques. By integrating conceptual modeling-specific data cleansing techniques into an automated pipeline, our approach reduces manual intervention, enhances reproducibility, and supports scalable analysis of model repositories. In an experimental evaluation of open-source UML diagram repositories, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cleansing models. In two reproducibility studies, we further show the statistically significant effect the use of our MCP4CM pipeline has on downstream tasks."

    "abstract": "As automotive electronic architectures grow increasingly complex and software development costs escalate, AUTOSAR plays a critical role in standardizing and enhancing the reusability of automotive controllers. However, existing AUTOSAR application layer modeling tools, such as the Simulink AUTOSAR Blockset, primarily adopt causal modeling paradigms, which constrain flexibility in capturing intricate system interactions. Additionally, their proprietary nature limits model accessibility, hindering cross-platform collaboration and multi-domain integration. Modelica, an object-oriented, equation-based modeling language, is particularly well-suited for multi-domain simulations due to its acausal modeling capabilities and strong support for component reuse. This paper proposes a Modelica-based visual modeling approach for AUTOSAR application layer models. Specifically, it establishes encapsulation rules for representing AUTOSAR constructs in Modelica and develops an open-source AUTOSAR model library, facilitating industry collaboration and accelerating rapid prototyping. A formal mathematical representation of AUTOSAR models is introduced to enhance both expressiveness and verifiability. Furthermore, a structured visual modeling methodology is presented to lower the development barrier for AUTOSAR application layer modeling. Comparative analysis with Simulink's AUTOSAR Blockset demonstrates that the proposed approach successfully integrates Modelica's multi-domain modeling capabilities into the AUTOSAR workflow while ensuring simulation consistency with Simulink. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first integration of AUTOSAR within Modelica's multi-domain simulation framework. Compared to Simulink, Modelica's acausal modeling paradigm enables more flexible system representations, its open ecosystem supports cross-platform collaboration, and its multi-domain integration enhances interoperability. Beyond the automotive domain, the proposed approach can also be applied to controller design in other industries, further demonstrating its potential for cross-disciplinary adoption."

One of its main drawbacks is the limited availability of pre-packaged software, in comparison to larger ecosystems, as it is instead the case with container registries or programming language package repositories. A transpilation approach might close this gap. However, it requires overcoming several technical issue dealing with native code execution. This work assesses the current transpilation technologies and the reduction of deployment friction. We report about the state of technology and contribute three advancements: (i) a compilation pipeline for Python applications using componentize-py and wasi-wheels, enabling native extension support; (ii) exploitation of hardware accelerators in Wasm via WASI-nn, and (iii) seamless cross-language composition using WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our result with two real-world applications in a 3-zones continuum, highlighting faster development without compromising software dependability.

This problem has typically been solved using traditional methods such as iterative numerical algorithms, which have proved to be computationally costly. This prompted researchers to investigate alternative approaches to this problem, and the most commonly used nowadays are artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization algorithms. With this in mind, this paper presents a study that investigated the use of the particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics problem of a robotic manipulator and compared its results with those of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. This led to the conclusion that although the particle swarm optimization is not superior to the Newton-Raphson algorithm in terms of time and memory, it provides more accurate and reliable results."

In imbalanced learning, stratified cross-validation is commonly recommended to preserve class distribution. However, it neglects the underlying distribution of instance hardness, which can introduce distribution shifts between training and testing folds, ultimately compromising the validity of performance evaluation. This paper proposes a stratified cross-validation informed by the hardness distribution for robust imbalanced medical diagnosis. The proposed multi-level cross-validation (MLCV) retains jointly the class distribution and instance hardness, maintaining equivalent distribution of hardness levels across folds. This strategy enables the model to encounter a more realistic version of the medical data for a reliable performance evaluation. Experimental work demonstrates that the hardness distribution shift exists; the (MLCV) not only enhances classification performance in imbalanced medical data but also improves the results of balancing methods, as measured by classification performance indicators such as recall, precision, and F1-measure."

To improve the accuracy of prediction in media consumer behaviour patterns, Bayesian optimized Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) based mathematical Modelling is adopted. By enhancing LSTM model for hyperparameter modifications, the suggested model utilizes Bayesian optimization techniques to boost the accuracy of capturing temporal patterns within custom data of the media. For sequential data, Recurrent neural networks are renowned for their capability to model long and short-term relationships. With the help of Bayesian optimization mathematical model, hyperparameters are dynamically modified to match the distinct features of media usage data, enabling fine-tuning of the LSTM model. Integrating LSTM networks into Bayesian optimization allows a more precise and effective description of the intricate patterns observed in social media consumption behaviour. In comparison with Random Forests, RNN based Click Stream Model & Gradient Tree Boosting Method, the mathematical framework of proposed Bayesian optimized LSTM model reaches an accuracy of 99% and an improvement of 9.62%. This research supports the developing field of predictive analytics by offering an effective tool for understanding and predicting the constantly changing behaviour of media customers where both social media & technology are always changing with time."

    "abstract": "Standardized benchmarks like RobustBench are crucial for evaluating adversarial robustness. However, the increasing dominance of models trained on massive synthetic datasets (orders of magnitude larger than original training sets) raises questions about reported performance gains. This work identifies and investigates a potential inflation factor: high feature-level similarity between large-scale synthetic training data and benchmark test sets. We argue this similarity is an inherent characteristic arising from the probabilistic generation process of these large datasets, which naturally produces examples highly similar to test instances in feature space. This creates what we term an “Implicit Information Advantage,” where models effectively train on near-duplicates of test instances. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that: (1) Synthetic datasets exhibit significantly higher similarity to the test set compared to the original training data. (2) A direct correlation exists between this similarity and robustness outcomes, with test images benefiting most having the highest similarity scores. (3) Strikingly, ablation studies show that training on just a small fraction (e.g., 1%) of the most similar synthetic examples can yield robustness comparable to using the full massive dataset. These findings suggest current benchmarks may overestimate true robust generalization due to this similarity artifact. We call for revised evaluation protocols and greater transparency to ensure benchmarks accurately measure true generalization.

    "abstract": "Coronary Heart disease prediction and classification is highly challenging in the medical industry as it leads to high mortality rate around the world. Many Medical researches have been performed by researchers to develop a disease diagnosis model to coronary heart disease in the early stages. Particularly those models become inefficient in detecting multiple categories of the coronary heart diseases through analysis of the patient’s clinical data. In addition, those model leads to multiple challenge while predicting the diseases such as data sparsity, over fitting and under fitting of the disease classes. In order to mitigate those challenges and to design a new model to predict and classify the coronary heart disease in early stages, a new intelligent computer vision model is designed using artificial intelligence approaches in this paper. Residual Convolution Neural Network is designed as precise prediction and classification approach on processing acquired multidimensional dataset of patients electronic health record towards coronary heart disease. Patient data acquired is high dimensional data which contains missing values. Initially model training is performed using preprocessing technique to eliminate the uncertainties in the patients data acquired. Preprocessed data is projected to the proposed residual convolutional Neural Network to process the dataset to obtain the disease classes on extracting the features and organizing those features in form of feature map in different hyper parameter tuned layer of the model. Convolution layer is feature extraction layer of the model process the preprocessed data using kernel function to obtain multiple features of the dataset and those extracted feature is represented in form of feature map. Extracted features in form feature map is processed in the pooling layer to select the disease level features and those disease level feature also organized in form of feature map. Feature map is processed through multiple functions such as activation function, softmax function and loss function of the fully connected layer. Activation function uses Rectified Linear Unit to linearize the feature map, softmax function uses support vector machine to classify the coronary heart disease as Angina, Cardiomyopathy and Endocardia and loss function uses the cross entropy to eliminate the over fitting and under fitting issues of the class. Experimental analysis and performance analysis of the proposed coronary heart disease based artificial intelligence architectures is performed using benchmark electronic health record dataset. Dataset is extracted from kaggle repository. On evaluation, experimental analysis and performance analysis proves the model efficiency and accuracy in detecting and classifying the coronary heart diseases against the state of art approaches. Finally model achieves 99.2% classification accuracy on cross validation of the model."

The model is iteratively updated and evaluated. Results show that even after just four missions, there is a consistent convergence of the mean and a reduction in the standard deviation from 0.1307 to 0.0449.

We analyzed 241 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens using portable spectrometry to capture gold nanoparticle optical signatures from SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests as a validation model. Systematic evaluation of normalization strategies revealed T-C differential outperformed T/C ratio normalization. Signal processing through Savitzky-Golay filtering, standard normal variate transformation, and principal component analysis reduced dimensionality from 601 to 4 features while retaining 97.26% variance. Among five evaluated algorithms, random forest achieved optimal performance (R² = 0.961, RMSE = 2.235 Ct) across clinically relevant ranges (PCR Ct 10.8-35.0). Bland-Altman analysis revealed measurement uncertainty of ±4.2 Ct, indicating suitability for population surveillance rather than precise individual quantification. Feature importance analysis identified 520-570 nm as the critical spectral region, consistent with gold nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance. This platform approach demonstrates that standard LFIAs contain extractable semi-quantitative information accessible through spectral-machine learning integration. While validated using COVID-19, the framework's modular design enables adaptation to diverse analytes including biomarkers, therapeutic drugs, and environmental contaminants without fundamental architectural changes. The methodology establishes a foundation for enhanced lateral flow diagnostics, particularly valuable in resource-limited settings where rapid semi-quantitative results provide greater utility than delayed laboratory measurements."

However, current VR broadcast systems often lack an effective camera language and do not adequately incorporate dynamic, in-game visualizations, limiting viewer engagement and narrative clarity. To address these limitations, we analyze 400 out-of-play segments from eight major tennis broadcasts to develop a tennis-specific design framework that effectively combines cinematic camera movements with embedded visualizations. We further refine our framework by examining 25 cinematic VR animations, comparing their camera techniques with traditional tennis broadcasts to identify key differences and inform adaptations for VR. Based on data extracted from the broadcast videos, we reconstruct a simulated game that captures the players' and ball's motion and trajectories. Leveraging this design framework and processing pipeline, we develope Beyond the Broadcast, a VR tennis viewing system that integrates embedded visualizations with adaptive camera motions to construct a comprehensive and engaging narrative. Our system dynamically overlays tactical information and key match events onto the simulated environment, enhancing viewer comprehension and narrative engagement while ensuring perceptual immersion and viewing comfort. A user study involving tennis viewers demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional VR broadcasting methods in delivering an immersive, informative viewing experience."

However, in such deployment, self-supervised learning methods and general machine learning models suffer from significant performance degradation when transferring to a dataset from an unseen clinic or device, due to domain shifts in data distribution between different datasets across clinics. Such domain shifts can cause high inter-class similarities and low cross-domain correlations. Previous domain generalization methods are often susceptible to under-generalization and over-generalization, especially in handling histopathological images. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain self-supervised learning method based on multi-granularity constraints. It combines pathology-specific imaging mechanisms to bound the generalized features of histopathological images in a stable representation space and to extend the generalization distance as much as possible under an adversarial constraint for preventing over-generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art methods has been demonstrated in a variety of analysis tasks on four independent prostate histopathological imagery datasets. The proposed method achieves an improved generalization in fine-tuned classification and segmentation using limited annotated samples."

    "abstract": "Due to water-surface reflection, wake and sun glitter, an uncrewed waterborne vehicle (UWV) faces a long-standing challenge in identifying water-surface obstacles especially with small-scale appearance. In this paper, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, a real-time surface obstacle segmentation network (RSOS-Net) is created to enable online surface-obstacle detection for a UWV. Primarily, the improved lightweight feature pyramid network structure is deployed to flexibly accommodate significant scale-variations and enhance focus on small obstacles, simultaneously. To address visual ambiguities caused by water-surface disturbances, the fast pyramid pooling module (FPPM) and attention-based feature fusion module (AFFM) are holistically devised within lightweight encoder and decoder, respectively. Accordingly, the FPPM is able to distinguish obstacles from sun glitters by capturing both local and global contextual information via cascaded pooling, while the AFFM can rule out reflections by virtue of channel-spatial attention mechanism augmenting detailed features and spatial locations. Results show that the RSOS-Net achieves an F1 score of 65.1% on the LaRS dataset, while the detection speed reaches 79.5 frames per second on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 platform. Notably, the RSOS-Net secured first place in the 3rd USV-based Embedded Obstacle Segmentation Challenge, with official results available at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://macvi.org/workshop/macvi25/summary</uri>"

The AETM is introduced to regulate the frequency of data transmission by adaptively adjusting the triggering thresholds. In addition, data integrity attacks with two forms of attack are considered, namely a multiplicative attack and a linear attack. In particular, these two types of attacks are launched with a certain order of priority. The objective of this paper is to design a distributed SE approach under the AETM, considering UCSs and data integrity attacks, where a locally optimized upper bound (UB) on the estimation error covariance (EEC) is obtained using the method of mathematical induction and minimized by properly selecting the estimator gain. Furthermore, a sufficient condition in relation to the uniform boundedness of the UB on the EEC is deduced. Besides, the monotonicity of the trace of the minimized UB of EEC with respect to the attack probability and strength is also analyzed and shown. Finally, simulation experiments with comparative results are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed distributed SE method in localizing multiple mobile robots."

First, an azimuth deramp-keystone processing method with a variable regulatory factor is proposed to uniformly eliminate the linear range walk term in the jammer’s frequency response (JFR), and effectively control the range curvature by adjusting the regulatory factor, thereby ensuring jamming modulation accuracy. Combined with the azimuth scaled Fourier transform, the quadratic and cubic Doppler phases of multiple moving targets with different motion parameters at different zero Doppler ranges are simultaneously compensated to generate the JFR efficiently. Second, based on differences in Doppler spectrum distribution, a modified keystone transform method is proposed to effectively address the azimuth ambiguity problem in generating JFR for fast-moving targets. Additionally, a JFR generation strategy using two-stage sampling points is proposed, further enhancing the efficiency of jamming modulation. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm requires only complex multiplication and fast Fourier transform operations to simultaneously generate multiple moving targets with different motion parameters and fast-moving targets. Moreover, when generating multiple moving targets with identical motion parameters, the computational complexity is reduced by 53.34%. Simulation results further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

In this study, Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with extended set of water coordinates under aquaphotomics was employed to detect and quantify honey adulteration.

    "abstract": "Diamond has emerged as an ideal material for thermal neutron detectors in high-temperature radiation environments due to its low atomic number, high displacement threshold energy, and excellent electron mobility. However, the temperature-dependent degradation mechanisms of its transient signals remain to be fully elucidated. This study proposes a multi-physics coupled simulation approach that integrates SRIM, TCAD, and Garfield++ to investigate the performance evolution of planar and trench-type diamond thermal neutron detectors over a temperature range of 300–700 K. Results show a clear correlation between temperature rise and signal degradation. For planar detectors, increasing temperature leads to reduced carrier mobility and enhanced lateral diffusion, causing a marked decrease in signal amplitude and a broadening of the signal time width. The signal amplitude undergoes a 50% reduction at 400 K and continues to decline to approximately 33% at 700 K, indicative of a substantial loss in detection capability. In trench-type detectors, the distinctive structural configuration results in enhanced sensitivity to temperature, where the current density diminishes and local electric field gradients are alleviated at elevated temperatures. The combined effect of these phenomena is to exacerbate charge dispersion and temporal signal broadening. The study elucidates a comprehensive degradation mechanism driven by temperature-induced changes in carrier transport properties and establishes a quantitative relationship between structural features, thermal effects, and signal behavior. These findings provide critical guidance for designing and optimizing diamond-based thermal neutron detectors in extreme environments."

    "abstract": "With continuously increasing requirements for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) have emerged as outstanding systems for its implementation due to the sufficient motion workspace and inherent cable flexibility. In particular, their modular structure facilitates straightforward reconfiguration. Inspired by this, this paper aims to enhance the dynamic characteristics of CDPRs during pHRI through online reconfiguration, so as to achieve the interaction performance improvement based on human intent. A novel metric, the mixed interaction wrench margin (MIWM), is first proposed to determine the optimal reconfiguration. This metric is devised by integrating the interaction force characteristics with CDPR inherent workspace properties, while explicitly considering the leading role of human intent. Subsequently, an adaptive-interaction-based reconfiguration strategy is established that the configuration can be arbitrarily changed by cable anchors, enabling compliant and adaptive pHRI. Informed by the actual interaction frequency, the strategy implements an asynchronous adjustment with different periods for configuration change and platform movement to achieve online optimization for reconfiguration. Finally, simulations and experiments conducted on different CDPR configurations with multiple pHRI tasks indicate that this strategy provides humans with more freedom, allowing them to exert more casual interaction forces, receive a quicker interactive response, and operate in a larger workspace."

    "abstract": "In industrial wireless networks, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is able to provide ultra-low latency and ultra-high bandwidth, emerging as a key technology to meet the real-time requirements of future industrial applications. In order to maintain the stability of the mmWave connection, the traditional approach is to perform beam alignment by frequent beam sweeping, but this results in additional beam overhead. Recently proposed vision-aided beam prediction models emerge as a solution to the above problem. However, the usage of models with complex structures, such as deep convolutional neural networks, requires substantial system storage and causes high computational costs. To this end, we propose a lightweight multimodal environment semantics aided beam prediction scheme. It extracts and combines the absolute and relative positions of the target from the locator and images as the environment semantics, then inputs them into an efficient and lightweight prediction model to output the optimal beam index. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the existing mainstream vision-aided or vision-position-aided beam prediction methods, the proposed model achieves a maximum top-1 beam prediction accuracy improvement of 7.6%, while saving the model size by about 83.4% and reducing the running time of the beam prediction stage by one order of magnitude."

We assume that the network of agents operates in a fully-decentralized manner, possessing the capability to exchange variables with their immediate neighbors. The proposed design methodology is supported by an analysis demonstrating that the difference between final outcomes, obtained when the global state is fully observed versus estimated through the social learning method, is ϵ bounded when an appropriate number of iterations of social learning updates are implemented. Unlike many existing dec-POMDP-based RL approaches, the proposed algorithm is suitable for model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning as it does not require knowledge of a transition model. Furthermore, experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over the current state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is a fundamental task in hyperspectral image analysis, aiming to decompose mixed pixels into endmember spectra and their corresponding fractional abundances. With the development of deep learning (DL), numerous DL-based unmixing methods have been proposed. However, most of these methods fail to integrate geometric priors (e.g., minimum volume constraints), limiting their performance in non-pure pixel scenarios (i.e., when no pure pixels are present in the scene). Current minimum volume constraint strategies based on the distance between endmembers and the data centroid may yield biased estimations under non-uniform data distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new blind unmixing network with minimum volume constraint, named MVCUN. By jointly constraining the simplex volume through a total variation (TV) term related with the endmembers and a volume upper bound term, MVCUN achieves improved unmixing performance in non-pure pixel scenarios and exhibits robustness against non-uniform data distributions. Furthermore, we design a multi-scale global context attention (MSGCA) module that fuses local and global channel information through multi-scale convolutions and fully connected layers, thereby improving the network’s ability to estimate abundances. Experimental results on one simulated dataset and three real datasets demonstrate that our MVCUN significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both endmember extraction and abundance estimation accuracy."

This study aims to improve sheet metal utilization by integrating Poka Yoke with loT-based systems, ergonomic workplace design, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for supplier selection. The results show substantial improvements in key indicators. Metal waste was reduced from 9.78% to 5.12%, exceeding the company's target of 6.51 %. Errors in the cutting process decreased from 2.80% to 0.47%, equivalent to an improvement of 83.21 %. Furthermore, the AHP method optimized supplier selection, reducing the percentage of factory-defective sheets from 4.10% to 2.63%. Regarding ergonomic design, ergonomic risk at the assembly station was reduced by 23.26%, going from a medium to a low level. These findings not only close the technical gap identified in the company, but also offer a replicable solution in other industries, improving the sector's competitiveness and safety."

Choosing a professional career is a crucial decision for students, but it is often influenced by subjective factors such as family pressure and friends' opinions, which can lead to a disconnect between the career choice and personal aspirations. This disconnect contributes to high dropout rates in higher education. The proposed model integrates psychometric profiles (RIASEC), academic performance, and socioeconomic data to recommend personalized career paths. By using GNNs, the model captures complex relationships between these factors, providing students with career suggestions tailored to their true interests and abilities. The system was evaluated using several GNN models, including GraphSAGE, GCN, and GAT, with GraphSAGE showing the highest accuracy in predictions. This approach aims to reduce dropout rates and help students make more informed vocational decisions aligned with their academic and professional future."

    "abstract": "It is well known that using the sink’s mobility to increase the network lifetime in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a successful tactic. However, barriers make it difficult to ensure effective data collecting and routing in real-world settings. An energy-efficient routing technique for mobile sinks in WSNs functioning in environments with neighboring barriers is presented in this work. The suggested technique makes use of a cluster-based methodology, in which cluster heads collect information from each member of the cluster and send it to the mobile sink. Before returning to the starting point, the mobile sink collects data from cluster heads within a single hop using a periodic data-gathering route. Routing in such contexts is difficult for standard algorithms to optimize due to the complexity provided by impediments. We address this by proposing an effective scheduling approach based on spanning graphs that allows the mobile sink to find the shortest path that avoids obstacles. The mobile sink is led via the best path while avoiding obstacles using a heuristic tour-planning algorithm. The simulation results show that our method is successful in enhancing network performance and energy efficiency."

Reviewing the broad applications of this technology across various sectors including higher education, vocational training health care, engineering, or business disciplines is the study’s objective. The immersive nature of VR enables students to interact with content in ways that traditional pedagogical methods cannot achieve, which in turn promotes active learning and collaboration. Underpinning the effective use of VR are key learning theories such as constructivism and experiential learning, promoting deeper cognitive engagement and retention of knowledge. However, the main challenges include high implementation costs, technical barriers, and the need for robust pedagogical frameworks. This paper synthesizes existing findings to highlight the benefits as well as the limitations of VR in education and consequently suggests pathways for future research and development. By addressing these challenges, educators can utilize the VR technology to produce even more engaging and personalized learning experiences that meet the requirements of a digital age. Meanwhile, the share of traditional education is still significant, but its combination with VR technology promises impressive student engagement, better retention of knowledge, and further development of useful skills."

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly used to generate programming practice, yet their cognitive demands for CS1 learners remain underexplored. We investigate student-perceived cognitive load on GPT-generated Python exercises using a custom intelligent tutoring system that captures fine-grained keystrokes and offers in-exercise AI feedback. Nineteen undergraduates completed nine exercises spanning loops, recursion, and classes and objects, yielding 171 submissions and 83,377 keystrokes. We triangulate self-reports with keystroke dynamics, code quality metrics, and knowledge component (KC) mastery. Perceived load largely tracked labeled difficulty and was inversely related to satisfaction. Keystroke features were the strongest correlates of load, with more typing bursts and longer inter-keystroke latencies accompanying higher demand; among code metrics, the SLoC-LLoC differential showed the highest association with demand, aligning higher structural complexity with greater mental effort. Lower mastery of core knowledge components—especially loops plus string and list operations—coincided with higher load. Students rated instant AI feedback helpful for debugging and best practices, though at times redundant or inconsistent with instructions. To estimate load automatically, we trained models on observed traces. An Extra Trees regressor predicted the primary load measure Demanding with RMSE 0.81, and a three-level classifier achieved 86 % accuracy with weighted F1 0.85 on held-out students. These results suggest actionable design levers for LLM-based tutors: calibrate task complexity, scaffold high-strain concepts, and deliver concise, context-aligned feedback while using keystroke- and code-based signals for real-time load monitoring.

After deployment, the framework keeps the deceptive en vironment synchronized with the original system by automaticall y re-deploying the pipeline in response to any changes in the sour ce laC file, increasing fidelity and reducing management costs. T he implementation of this prototype successfully shows a reductio n in the manual effort required for deploying and maintaining de ception environments, presenting a scalable and sustainable fram ework for active defense.

Most traditional resource management systems may not be sufficient to handle the growing complexity of cloud resource control and management due to increased base requirements. Employing metrics like operational cost, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency, this study compares five cutting-edge ML methods: Neural Architecture Search, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Autoencoders, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The objective is to determine the most effective method for running the organization. The results show that LSTM networks may improve demand estimation accuracy by 13% and total resource usage efficiency by 23%, while RL-based techniques can reduce the operational cost and minimize the provisioning delay for about 20% and 30%, respectively. When GBM models are used in predictions, there is a 31% decrease in predicting inaccuracy, a twenty percent reduction in expenses, and a 25% improvement in services. The models identify anomalies and 98% accuracy using autoencoders, which results in a 16% increase in allocation efficiency. A 25% boost in computing speed and an 19% increase in accuracy are produced by the Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-optimized models. These theorized results demonstrate that AI-based strategies may improve cloud scalability as well as offer practical suggestions to the management of resources at the cloud environment."

    "abstract": "Training 3D generative models often faces bottle-necks due to dependencies on precise camera pose estimation, particularly when using Neural Radiance Fields (N eRFs) for photorealistic novel-view synthesis. We introduce HyperNeR-FGAN, a generative framework that eliminates camera pose requirements by integrating a hypernetwork with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This architecture maps Gaussian noise directly to the weights of a NeRF model, bypassing viewing direction inputs during training. Our experiments demonstrate that HyperNeRFGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets where camera position estimation is impractical - notably in medical imaging scenarios with limited or ambiguous viewpoint metadata. Despite its architectural simplicity compared to existing methods, the model produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions across diverse modalities, including MRI and X-ray-derived 2D scans. The framework's efficiency and robustness suggest broad applicability in domains requiring 3D generation from unstructured or poorly annotated 2D data. Key revisions emphasize the camera-pose independence, clinical relevance, and architectural efficiency while maintaining technical nrecision."

These methods are implemented and compared on a differential-drive robot tasked with maintaining a specific orientation and position. A virtual model is utilized to facilitate safe and efficient learning before deploying the algorithms to a physical robot. This study provides practical insights into teaching reinforcement learning concepts and leveraging them for robotics applications."

    "abstract": "This study emphasizes recent advances in learning analytics and explainable AI to provide meaningful insights for data-driven interventions. We explore how ICT-based Smart Learning Environments (SLE) can enhance decision-making through predictive models with the aim of supporting learners at risk of underperformance. Our approach introduces an analytical framework that uses raw interaction data extracted from Learning Management Systems (LMS), focusing on both cognitive and social dimensions of the collaborative learning process. The system incorporates interactive dashboards and dynamic visualizations that inform tutors about group dynamics and individual engagement, allowina for early detection of learning difficulties. The first experimental results underline the effectiveness of tracking behavioral patterns and generating multi-dimensional learning indicators, which serve to improve instructional support and reflective learner feedback. This contribution emphasizes the role of predictive analytics and interpretability in the facilitation of adaptive and scalable learning interventions within SLE. This predictive model is enhanced by the integration of SHAP values of explainable AI techniques to describe the most influential learning behaviors that conduct the model's decisions. In this case, the tutors receive early risk alerts and understand each prediction."

    "abstract": "Technological advances in recent years have allowed major developments in the field of autonomous vehicles. This technology has proven to be increasingly reliable and efficient in reducing accidents and optimizing transportation resources. However, it is a rapidly developing area, and comparative studies are still needed to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of each type of controller in different use cases. This article addresses the development of steering control for autonomous vehicles by comparing the classic PID control technique and the modern control techniques using a Robust Linear Quadratic Regulator. The objective is to assess the advantages and disad-vantages of each of these controllers when applied to automotive models in a numerical simulation environment. PID, nominal LQR, and robust LQR controllers were designed and applied to autonomously drive the car along a reference path. The simulated results show the highest efficiency in the nominal LQR controller when there are no car parameter variations, the PID controller shows performance degradation with mass variations, while the Robust LQR controller maintains its performance. Therefore, applications that are subject to high parametric uncertainties are better served by the robust LQR controller."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on wireless communication with a Ground Control Station (GCS) for flight control, primarily using the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol. However, MAVLink lacks essential security mecha-nisms, making UAVs vulnerable to attacks. We introduce a stealthy relay-based Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack called Shadow-GCS, in which an unauthorized node relays MAVLink messages to maintain normal communication while injecting commands. The Shadow-GCS attack enables an adversary to monitor and control UAV s without triggering alerts at the GCS. To assess the attack's detectability, we collected a dataset from four realistic UAV-GCS scenarios. We then evaluated two existing MAVLink intrusion detection systems (IDSs), revealing their limitations in identifying attacks that do not significantly alter normal communication flow. To overcome these limitations and develop a more generalized intrusion detection capability, we propose GALAXY, an attention-based LSTM model with a single LSTM layer, where the attention weights are jointly derived from the hidden state and local statistical features. Experimental results show that GALAXY achieves detection performance comparable to a stacked LSTM baseline while offering improved interpretability."

    "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also show how NMF can be employed for data denoising."

This may hinder daily routines of a women affecting her personal and professional life. Timely intervention during disease stage improves understanding of disease progression and facilitates the development of targeted therapies. Hence early identification of uterine fibroids is crucial in daily life of a women. Deep learning enhances uterine fibroid identification by enabling accurate, automated detection and classification from medical imaging, improving diagnostic efficiency and precision. There are different deep learning models to identify the uterine fibroids. Ultra sound images are utilized in this study. A comparative study of 10 different state-of-the-art deep learning models like ResNet50, ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, Xception, EfficientNetB0, MobileNet, VGG16, EfficientNetB0 and InceptionV3 are performed with Dual Path CNN (DPCNN) this research. The accuracy of the DPCNN is found 97%. The accuracy obtained by all other models showed similar values which is less than DPCNN. Performance measures used in this paper are accuracy, precision, confusion matrix and F1 score values. While comparing these performance values of DPCNN, found that the values are better than other models. Future research can be explored by integrating a refined customized model of DPCNN to improve the existing performance measures for the identification of uterine fibroid."

The proposed structure consists of a unidirectional, single-layer unit cell that functions as a triple-band microwave absorber. The top surface of the absorber features a copper-based geometric pattern on a FR-4 lossy substrate, whereas copper completely covers the bottom surface. As per the simulation outcomes, the absorber exhibits peak absorption values of 92%, 96%, and 98% corresponding to frequencies of 3.02 GHz, 5.11 GHz and 8.37 GHz. Incoming electromagnetic waves are efficiently captured by the absorber under dual-mode (TE/TM). Strong absorption in the triple-band range is accomplished by means of an optimal structural configuration. In the 1–10 GHz frequency range, under dual-mode (TE/TM), the reflected signal remains under -14 dB. The efficiency of the design frequency-sensitive surface is validated through both simulation and experimental observations."

Although social media offers many benefits, such as enhancing knowledge accessibility and fostering meaningful connections, its growing use also presents considerable risks to mental health. This abstract includes details on heightened anxiety, sadness, and diminished self-esteem. Social comparison, online abuse, and FOMO are frequently linked to these illnesses. Numerous concepts have been put forward to deal with these adverse consequences. Mental health counselling (CBT), educating people the way to use media properly and organised social interactions in the real world are all part of the mixed-methods approach. System dynamics simulations and weekly psychology tests are also used to support the approach. Over six weeks, participants in the study had considerable improvements in all outcome measures compared to the control group, including anxiety (which decreased by 30.6%), depression (which decreased by 33.3%), and self-esteem (which increased by 25.4%). The uniqueness and efficacy of this method in connecting theoretical suggestions with practical, scalable solutions are validated by a comparative SOTA study. To promote healthy digital behaviour and improve psychological well-being within the ever-more-connected society, this study offers a verified, data-driven plan of action."

CACTUS leverages Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Barycenter Averaging and introduces a cross-correlation loss to enforce temporal consistency and alignment. We introduce two variants of CACTUS: one that emphasizes minimal perturbations while maintaining classification validity, and another that ensures gradual, realistic modifications in the time series. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that CACTUS outperforms state-of-the-art optimization-based methods by generating more reliable and interpretable counterfactual explanations, establishing it as a robust tool for post-hoc time series models analysis and explanations."

At its core, CLGuard uses a contrasting language goal (CLG) formulation to measure the semantic alignment between a vehicle's action and the driving scene. When a control command is found to be inconsistent with the expected behavior in context, CLGuard suppresses it in real time. Unlike signal-level detectors, CLGuard is faultagnostic and operates as a non-intrusive wrapper. Experiments in CARLA show that CLGuard improves safety and robustness across diverse control fault scenarios."

To address these limitations, we present the ILPA (Influence-aware Label Propagation Algorithm), which enhances label assignment using node influence, incorporating degree and neighbor centralities, along with structural similarity based on common neighbors. ILPA eliminates randomness and thereby ensures more accurate and stable community detection. Evaluation on real-world social networks demonstrate that ILPA yields better results than LPA and its variants in most cases based on modularity and NMI while maintaining near-linear time complexity."

    "abstract": "This work presents the design and implementation of an IoT-enabled hydroponic green forage system. The prototype integrates a LoRaWAN-based communication network to monitor and control key growth parameters, promoting a sustainable agricultural approach. The system operates in three main stages. First, a Heltec Wireless Stick, an ESP32-based MCU, processes sensor data and adjusts environmental conditions to maintain optimal growth parameters. Second, data is transmitted via LoRaWAN through The Things Network (TTN) and relayed to a server via downlink communication. Finally, in the third stage, the data is processed for visualization. Information from TTN is transmitted via MQTT to Node-RED, where it is filtered and organized for real-time monitoring on an interactive dashboard. This architecture ensures efficient data transmission, remote monitoring, and precise environmental control for hydroponic forage production."

    "abstract": "This paper presents MUSE-SLAM, a robust multi-sensor fusion framework designed for state estimation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied and visually degraded environments, such as underwater. The system is based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and four complementary sensors to overcome the drift commonly associated with traditional dead-reckoning methods. The sensors are: an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for high-frequency motion tracking, a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) for velocity relative to the seafloor, a pressure sensor for absolute depth measurement, and a mechanically scanned imaging sonar (MSIS) used to detect environmental landmarks. An important aspect of MUSE-SLAM is its asynchronous sensor integration strategy, which processes timestamped measurements in chronological order, allowing for varying sensor update rates and accommodating communication delays. The approach is validated using a real-world dataset. Experimental results highlight the clear benefits of the multi-sensor setup: when comparing different sensor combinations, the full configuration (using all four sensors) showed significantly improved performance."

    "abstract": "This study introduces an innovative multimodal system designed to support the assessment of Parkinson’s disease, atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, and Huntington’s disease by integrating mixed-reality (MR) technology, specifically using augmented reality goggles. The system captures symptoms related to neurodegenerative disorders through detailed sensor data, including hand movements, gait, and gaze patterns. Central to our methodology is an interactive, game-like experience lasting 30 min, comprising 17 tasks that evaluate motor skills, speech, memory, cognitive functions, gait, and gaze. These tasks were developed in collaboration with neurologists and draw upon established clinical paradigms. This engaging experience, combined with traditional clinical tests, provides a comprehensive assessment of both physical and cognitive capabilities. Rather than aiming to provide a diagnostic decision, this study focuses on evaluating the feasibility and usability of the system in a clinical setting. By automating diagnostic tasks and utilizing MR technology, our approach enhances patient comfort and offers a more immersive and efficient assessment process. The system was evaluated with 15 neurodegenerative patients and 32 healthy subjects, demonstrating high scores in both immersion and usability across both groups. This work represents a first step toward integrating MR into clinical workflows for neurodegenerative disease assessment."

    "abstract": "Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments show that GradMLMD maintains comparable or better performance than MLMD and outperforms existing detectors. Among defenses based on the off-manifold conjecture, GradMLMD presents a novel method for capturing manifold changes and provides a practical solution for real-world application challenges."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Learning-based control with safety guarantees usually requires real-time safety certification and modifications of possibly unsafe learning-based policies. The control barrier function (CBF) method uses a safety filter (SF) containing a constrained optimization problem to produce safe policies. However, finding a valid CBF for a general nonlinear system requires a complex function parameterization, which in general makes the policy optimization problem difficult to solve in real time. For nonlinear systems with nonlinear state constraints, this paper proposes the novel concept of state-action CBFs (SACBFs), which do not only characterize the safety at each state but also evaluate the control inputs taken at each state. SACBFs, in contrast to CBFs, enable a flexible parameterization, resulting in a SF that involves a convex quadratic optimization problem, which significantly alleviates the online computational burden. We propose a learning-based approach to synthesize SACBFs. The effect of learning errors on the effectiveness of SACBFs is addressed by constraint tightening and introducing a new concept called contractive-set CBFs. This ensures formal safety guarantees for the learned CBFs and control policies. Simulation results on an inverted pendulum with elastic walls validate the proposed CBFs in terms of constraint satisfaction and CPU time."

Unlike MOEA/D, which constructs subproblems through weighted aggregation of multiple objectives, MCEA/D converts objective functions into constraints while retaining a single objective function, generating subproblems via constraint value space decomposition. Consequently, MCEA/D performs optimization within different constraint subspaces, with each subproblem operating in its own search space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the diversity loss and premature convergence issues of MOEA/D caused by the shared search space among subproblems. The results of uniformly excited concentric ring sparse array optimization demonstrate that MCEA/D can successfully identify feasible Pareto fronts, outperforming MOEA/D algorithm in this capability. Electromagnetic simulations validate the results."

    "abstract": "Existing 3D occupancy networks demand significant hardware resources, hindering the deployment of resource-limited devices. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a potential solution by substantially reducing computational and memory requirements. However, their performance decrease notably compared to full-precision networks. In addition, it is challenging to enhance the performance of the binarized model by increasing the number of binarized convolutional layers, which limits its practicability for 3D occupancy prediction. In this paper, we reconsider the components in binarized convolutional layers, and structures, for 3D occupancy prediction task. Two original insights into binarized convolution are presented, substantiated with theoretical proofs: (a) 1×1 binarized convolution introduces minimal binarization errors as the network deepens, and (b) binarized convolution is inferior to full-precision convolution in capturing cross-channel feature importance. Building on the above insights, we propose a novel binarized deep convolution (BDC) unit that significantly enhances performance, even when the number of binarized convolutional layers increases to meet the requirements of 3D occupancy networks. Specifically, in the BDC unit, additional binarized convolutional kernels are constrained to 1×1 to minimize the effects of binarization errors. Further, we propose a per-channel refinement branch to reweight the output via first-order approximation. Then, we partition the 3D occupancy networks into four distinct convolutional modules, employing BDC units to explore the effects of binarizing each of these modules. The proposed BDC unit minimizes binarization errors and improves perceptual capability, meeting the stringent requirements for accuracy and computational efficiency in 3D occupancy prediction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDC unit achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D occupancy prediction and 3D object detection tasks, while significantly reducing parameters and computational costs. This highlights the potential of the BDC unit as an efficient fundamental component in binarized 3D occupancy networks. Code for our paper will be released on “https://github.com/zzk785089755/BDC”."

The simple auxiliary circuit provides soft switching condition for the main switch as well as an improvement in the overall gain. Zero-Voltage Switching (ZVS) and Zero-Current Switching (ZCS) turn-on and off are achieved for the main switch and the auxiliary switch, respectively. All diodes turn off under ZCS. Consequently, conduction and switching losses, along with the reverse recovery problem, are significantly reduced that enables an increased switching frequency of 100kHz along with an enhancement in the overall efficiency. A 500W, 400V experimental prototype is implemented and the reported full load theoretical and practical efficiencies are 96.81% and 96.5%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Time series data has a wide range of real-life applications, including financial forecasting, health monitoring, and social media analysis. However, this data often contains substantial individual privacy, and directly releasing them may lead to privacy infringement. Although existing research has proposed methods based on centralized differential privacy or local differential privacy to protect the privacy of time series data by injecting noise into the data, these methods may not be feasible in value-critical applications. Our previous work has introduced the TLDP model, which perturbs temporal data to ensure privacy guarantee while retaining original values. However, challenges persist when applying these methods to data exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations, such as trajectories. This paper proposes a novel trajectory release framework, Region-Aware Trajectory Re-sorting (RATR), which builds upon the temporal perturbation mechanism of TLDP by further introducing region-aware reachable constraints based on real road networks. In this way, it ensures privacy while significantly improving the spatial data utility. We construct region-aware reachable constraints and design a re-sorting algorithm to optimize the perturbed trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of data utility while maintaining a lower overall cost."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a direct robust adaptive fuzzy controller designed for a mini drone. The controller is developed to address the challenge of controlling the six-coupled nonlinear subsystems of the mini-drone with unknown dynamics for position and attitude control. The proposed control approach combines a fuzzy adaptive controller and the Bat Algorithm (BA) based optimization technique to elaborate decentralized control structure. The control inputs of the drone are generated through a Mamdani-type fuzzy adaptive controller, based exclusively on the system's tracking errors. This design choice effectively circumvents the singularity issues commonly encountered in indirect adaptive control schemes, while avoiding the need for robust state observers. To address external disturbances and model uncertainties, a robust compensatory term is incorporated into the fuzzy controller. The Bat Algorithm (BA) is employed to optimize the adaptation parameters of the controller to achieve the best performance in trajectory tracking. This approach resolves the trial-and-error issue in parameter selection which gives a systematic and optimal tuning of the control parameters. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously established via Lyapunov theory. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through various simulation cases on a virtual platform of Parrot Mini-Drone, as well as experimental validation for hovering. The results show that the proposed controller can handle unknown dynamics, uncertainties, and external disturbances while achieving accurate position and attitude control."

A novel computational framework is introduced, integrating a graph-based multimodal embedding network with an adaptive strategy engine to reflect the interactional semantics of stress propagation. The framework includes StressGraph, a cognitive-interactional graph dynamics network that models time-evolving stress states via graph convolution and recurrent operations, and NeuroReaSON, a neurocognitive realignment module that transforms latent embeddings into individualized mitigation strategies through predictive realignment and simulation. Experimental results demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and long-horizon strategic coherence over existing approaches, supporting scalable and interpretable modeling of complex internal states in uncertain and dynamic environments."

Unlike conventional methods that rely on Point Neural Network (PNN) encoders, our model explicitly exploits the inherent graph structure of the problem, enabling a more comprehensive representation of node and edge relationships. Specifically, we transformed a VRPTPLR dataset into a graph prior to training, assigned and normalized the edge weights, and then used the resulting graph as input to the GNN encoder. This preprocessing enriches the input representation, allowing the model to extract more informative features and thereby identify improved routing solutions. The GNN encoder was implemented with a Neural Network Convolution (NNConv) layer to effectively capture the complex interdependencies between customer nodes and vehicles. We evaluated the proposed approach against the PNN-based baseline across the three datasets. Experimental results show that the GNN-based model achieves faster convergence and yields benefit improvements ranging from 0.24% to 0.49%."

The CASA problem presents several challenges. First, previous source separation sys tems require training on clean data, which is often scarce. Second, existing conditional source separation systems are designed to separate only a limited number of sound classes and cannot scale to separate hundreds of classes. Third, prior works require users to specify the sounds to be separated and cannot automatically detect which sound classes to separate. Fourth, there is a limited research on building hierarchical source separation systems. The contributions of this work are as follows. First, we propose training universal source separation (USS) systems on large scale weakly labeled and unlabelled datasets, rather than relying solely on clean data. Second, we develop a large-scale USS system capable of separating up to 527 sound classes, with the potential to scale to unlimited number of classes. Third, we introduce a method to automatically detect and separate sound classes without user specification. Fourth, we present a hierarchical USS system that can separate sound classes at various hierarchical levels. We train the USS systems on AudioSet and evaluate their performance on speech, audio, and music datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

These conditions, which have shared risk factors such as muscle weakening and neurological impairments, can considerably affect health, particularly in older adults, leading to malnutrition, respiratory infections, cardiovascular strain, and reduced quality of life. Thus, regular assessment and the early detection of swallowing and respiratory disorders are critical for preventing life-threatening complications. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as videofluoroscopic swallow study and polysomnography, are effective but impractical for home use because of their invasiveness, high costs, and reliance on specialized equipment. Therefore, this study developed a portable noninvasive system equipped with a force-sensitive resistor, laryngeal microphone, and nasal airflow cannula attached to an airflow transducer to monitor behaviors that require coordinated respiratory and neurological control, namely swallowing, speech, coughing, and snoring. The system collects synchronized multi-sensor data at 30 Hz and converts these signal into static waveform images for classification. To enhance behavior classification performance, a YOLOv5s 4-model ensemble was developed, where each YOLOv5s model is specialized to detect one specific behavior. The proposed system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 97.4% and a mean average precision of 97.3% across 3920 labeled images. Comparative evaluations were performed against three alternative models: the YOLOv5s single model, YOLOv8n, and a 1D CNN model using raw time-series data. The YOLOv5s 4-model ensemble outperformed these baseline methods, achieving superior detection performance while maintaining robustness across behavior classes. This system may offers a cost-effective solution for early detection and continuous monitoring of dysphagia, OSA, and related respiratory conditions in home or clinical environments, potentially providing an accessible alternative to conventional diagnostic approaches."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of virtual AI streamers, choosing between a virtual streamer and a live streamer is a crucial decision for the brand manufacturer when launching a live-streaming business. This paper examines a dual-channel supply chain model consisting of a brand manufacturer, a store retailer, and either an artificial intelligence (AI) streamer or a key opinion leader (KOL) streamer. KOL streamers possess significant advantages over AI streamers due to their ability to interact effectively with consumers and their large fan bases. However, participating in pre-arranged KOL live-streaming events can incur a hassle cost for consumers, which is not required for AI streamers. Additionally, when collaborating with a KOL, the brand manufacturer must pay a fixed payment and a commission rate on revenues generated from live-streaming e-commerce, which can be ignored for AI streamers. Our research indicates that the costs associating with KOLs are a key factor in mode selection. We identify cost thresholds under which the brand manufacturer may prefer the KOL live-streaming mode over the AI mode. We also find that the hassle cost is a double-edged sword for the brand manufacturer. When the hassle cost is high, the KOL mode may still be preferred over AI mode. We then derive the retailer's mode preference and identify the conditions for achieving a common preference for the brand manufacturer and the retailer in both live-streaming scenarios. Finally, we conduct three extensions: considering product returns, exploring an alternative in-house live-streaming mode to the KOL mode, and examining the implications of an existing online channel. Results show that the findings of the main model remain robust."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a high-precision human pose estimation method using sparse IMU sensors, featuring two novel components. Firstly, an anatomy-guided sensor association model is proposed. Based on the inherent anatomical relationships within the human body, the human body is divided into five main parts, with joints in each part being associated with specific IMUs. By means of this model, the limited data from sparse IMUs can be effectively utilized to enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. Secondly, a hybrid deep learning architecture is presented. It consists of five parallel branches corresponding to the five parts of the human body. The architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is utilized to reconstruct the pose of the corresponding anatomical part. The method addresses motion ambiguity caused by action distribution limitations in traditional inertial pose estimation. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art models across four public datasets."

    "abstract": "The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems, owing to its ability to intelligently manipulate wireless channels by adjusting the phase of impinging signals. Despite its potential, the practical deployment of RIS faces significant challenges, primarily due to the requirement of accurate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) configuration, leading to substantial channel estimation overhead and increased hardware complexity. While the use of statistical channel state information (CSI) mitigates this issue to some extent, the dynamic nature of wireless channels, driven by user mobility, environmental changes, and other factors, continues to restrict system performance. In this work, we propose a joint optimization framework to address these challenges. Our approach combines a neural network-based reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) configuration method called statistical-RISnet (S-RISnet), which uses partial historical channel samples to predict optimal phase shifts, with a robust change-detection mechanism for the covariance matrix. The detector monitors variations in the angle of arrival (AoA) and user equipment (UE) distance, updating the channel covariance matrix only when significant performance degradation is predicted. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces estimation and computation overhead while maintaining performance near the theoretical optimum. This framework offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted networks, enabling feasible and high-performance deployment."

    "abstract": "Maps are essential to news media as they provide a familiar way to convey spatial context and present engaging narratives. However, the design of journalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance multiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy, tight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists often come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and data science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While previous studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this research seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process employed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific research questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do editorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we collected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news articles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result, we created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both properties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features of maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured interviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily. Through these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made by editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected the practitioners' feedback on our design space to externally validate it. With these results, we aim to provide researchers and journalists with empirical data to design and study journalistic maps."

    "abstract": "Penguins exhibit remarkable swimming capabilities with high speeds and efficient gliding for extended durations, thus providing an exemplary biological model for biomimetic underwater vehicles. In this article, inspired by the flapping–gliding locomotion mechanism observed in aquatic organisms, we create a novel robotic penguin capable of multimodal locomotion that combines biomimetic flapping and efficient gliding motions. Initially, a pair of three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) wings and a 1-DOF vertical tail is constructed to generate forward thrust and steering torque for biomimetic flapping motion. Meanwhile, a buoyancy adjustment system and a slider system are designed for gliding motion. Thereafter, a full-state dynamic model, including both flapping and gliding motions, is established by employing the Newton–Euler method. Particularly, the hydrodynamic coefficients are precisely calibrated through system identification utilizing experimental data. Finally, extensive simulations and experiments are conducted, encompassing forward swimming and turning maneuvers in both flapping and gliding modes. The results obtained validate the superior flapping and gliding performance of the designed system as well as the effectiveness of the dynamic model, providing new insights for next-generation underwater vehicles with enhanced maneuverability in dynamic and complex aquatic environments."

NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration.

By utilizing the different frequency shifts of TDF and HDF, which effectively improves the threshold of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). Compared to a 2.2 m TDF amplifier, the bidirectional pumped 1.1 m TDF&1.4 m HDF hybrid amplifier eliminates SBS and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 39 dB to 48 dB. At a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 10 kHz, limited by gain saturation, the pulse energy and peak power are 17.5 μJ and 116 W, respectively. In addition, compared to a 2.8 m TDF amplifier, the bidirectional pumped 1.4 m TDF&1.4 m HDF hybrid amplifier increases pulse energy from 10.4 μJ to 34 μJ and peak power from 69 W to 226 W at the pulse widths of 150 ns, raising the SBS threshold by 3.2 times. The linewidth of the narrow linewidth light is about 5.12 MHz, which is close to the Fourier transform limit. The polarization extinction ratio (PER) and beam quality factor M2 are estimated to be about ∼15.6 dB and ∼1.08."

    "abstract": "Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. Evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization."

    "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP (SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP (FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning (ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP (E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines."

    "abstract": "Cruise ships remain a popular vacation choice for millions of travelers annually. However, the on-board environment, characterized by high population density and close-contact settings in ventilated indoor spaces, creates ideal conditions for the spread of highly airborne transmissible respiratory diseases, such as SARS-COV-2. Thus, this study focuses on an effective framework for managing airborne transmission risks of both known and emerging infectious diseases, which are intensified by the growing capacity and density of modern passenger ships, while acknowledging that other mechanisms may also contribute to disease transmission. Hence, early risk assessment (RA) of disease transmissibility is essential for safeguarding public health and enhancing the passenger experience, preparing the cruise industry for future pandemics, and strengthening the overall resilience and safety of cruise operations. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a valuable method for modeling complex data-driven systems in the context of risk assessment. However, traditional FCM construction is typically performed manually, which limits automation and hampers the accurate representation of uncertainty. We propose Intuitionistic Risk Assessment FCM (IRA-FCM), a novel framework that: (i) employs a hybrid learning framework that integrates unsupervised clustering to reveal hidden patterns within the data with supervised learning based on labeled instances to automatically learn the structure of an intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM); (ii) integrates multi-source sensor and system data with varying uncertainty levels; and (iii) models uncertainty via hesitancy, enabling more accurate, uncertainty-aware transmission risk assessment. Additionally, it estimates the confidence levels associated with various degrees of risk, serving as a comprehensive decision-support tool to ensure safety throughout the cruise duration by quantifying the uncertainty in its assessments. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a dataset representing various airborne and close contact transmission scenarios of SARS-COV-2 within monitored areas, created using a validated agent-based model designed for airborne disease spread. The results validate its capacity to determine the transmission risk with an average accuracy of 88.6%. The applicability of the proposed framework extends beyond cruise ships, to assess the airborne disease transmission risk in ventilated indoor spaces with resident populations, such as apartment buildings, hotels and hospitals."

Accurate identification of the N1 stage is of critical importance in both sleep neuroscience and clinical practice. However, due to the ambiguous features during N1 stage, current deep learning models still struggle to achieve satisfactory performance. To address these challenges, SleepHybridNet integrates multi-scale feature fusion and sequence modeling through a novel architecture. It consists of a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) module, a Transformer encoder, a spectral feature extraction unit, and a multi-task classifier. Experimental results based on the publicly available Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that SleepHybridNet outperforms existing methods in both classification accuracy and generalization capability. Specifically, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 88.2% and an F1-score of 0.633 for the N1 stage, showing superior performance particularly in underrepresented classes such as N1 and N3 stages. With only 5.1 M parameters, the lightweight design of the model can enable practical deployment in clinical settings, bridging the gap between high-performance deep learning algorithms and practical applicability in sleep medicine. Future work may explore the integration of multimodal data from wearable sensors to further expand its use in diverse application scenarios."

Despite recent advancements, such as dual branch cross-attention (CA) mechanism, existing methods struggle to differentiate ambiguous emotion categories effectively. In addition, the limited size and diversity of GER datasets hinder further performance improvements. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel approach, the multimodal spatiotemporal semisupervised transformer (MSST). First, we propose a multimodal spatiotemporal transformer to encode spatial features, capture temporal dynamics, and fuse information from three modalities effectively. Second, a semisupervised learning (SSL) strategy leverages unlabeled data, enhancing robustness against noise and outliers. Last, a two-stage classification strategy and consistency loss are introduced to improve the model’s ability to handle category ambiguity and ensure robust predictions for similar samples. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark GER datasets demonstrate that MSST either considerably outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing GER research and overcoming the limitations of existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive wireless implants distributed in the nervous system can transfer various neural signals to an external device, offering an effective hardware tool for neuro-disorder monitoring. Battery-free wireless techniques based on wireless power transfer (WPT) have been adopted to minimize the neural implants, but the effective reading ranges of most conventional works are not long enough to access deep-tissue nerves. The existing ultrasonic coupling and binary-driven passive body-channel-communication (BCC) techniques extended the reading range but suffered from a low data rate and a high energy in wireless communication. In this work, we demonstrate a battery-free wireless neural implant based on the proposed pulse-width-modulation (PWM) passive-BCC technique, which improves the data rate and further reduces the energy per bit. The proposed technique is implemented in a neural-recording chip fabricated by a 65nm CMOS process. Measured results show that the proposed wireless neural implant achieves a battery-free reading range of 6cm, with an energy efficiency of 36.2pJ/bit. In-vivo experiment is performed in a Sprague-Dawley rat to record the neural signals wirelessly in a battery-free way."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become increasingly widespread in recent years. Since IoT devices tend to suffer from attacks from the Internet, they need monitoring using intrusion detection systems (IDS). However, IDS running inside a target system can be easily disabled by intruders. To address this issue, several approaches have been proposed to securely execute IDS using trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone. Nevertheless, existing approaches have several drawbacks, e.g., substantial overhead for accessing the memory of the target system and too high privileges to execute IDS. This paper proposes Keyspector for enabling the secure execution of IDS using Keystone, which is a TEE for RISC- V processors. Keyspector executes IDS inside a secure execution environment called an enclave, which has relatively low privileges. For efficient monitoring, it enables only an enclave running IDS to share the memory of the target system using the security monitor running below the system. Using the shared memory, IDS can directly monitor the data of the target system. We have implemented Keyspector in the security monitor and the Eyrie runtime and confirmed that the overhead of the IDS running in an enclave was 10%, compared with the traditional IDS."

    "abstract": "Botnet attacks pose persistent security threats in IoT networks by sequentially infecting devices to create zombie networks for DDoS attacks. Analyzing botnet propagation requires approaches that consider entire system traversal rather than isolated targets. We propose a reinforcement learning-based model that identifies optimal attack paths from an attacker's perspective. Our approach employs Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to analyze network structure and trains using policy gradient techniques to select high-vulnerability nodes during exploration. We implemented a depth-first search algorithm with branch tracking that reflects realistic attacker behavior, evaluating neighbors based on Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores and maximizing cumulative vulnerability scores as rewards. Experimental validation on the UNSW IoT traffic dataset demonstrates effective identification of vulnerability-based attack paths. The model successfully reconstructed network topologies by eliminating non-essential edges while retaining critical paths, providing actionable intelligence for defensive resource allocation. Results show our approach effectively discovers high-risk paths by jointly considering node connectivity and vulnerability scores in realistic IoT environments."

The dataset, comprising 8,124 mushroom samples with 22 features, sourced from the Machine Learning Department at the University of California, Irvine, and available in the KEEL repository, is employed. In this work, we research various ELM variants (standard, regularized, and weighted) to optimize the classification of mushrooms. Evaluation includes five-fold cross- validation, assessing accuracy, geometric mean, and training time. In the context of Chile's thriving edible mushroom industry, this research underscores the pivotal role of ELM in efficiently categorizing mushrooms for culinary and industrial applications. The findings provide crucial insights, bridging the gap between research and industrial needs in the accurate differentiation of edible and poisonous mushrooms. The results highlight the potential of ELM for mushroom classification; all ELM variants achieve an accuracy and G-mean of nearly 1. Consequently, this study underscores the capabilities of ELM, characterized by its high performance and lower computational complexity when compared to contemporary Machine Learning techniques."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparative performance analysis of MongoDB and Redis within a microservices-based web application designed as a library micro-directory. The aim is to evaluate the suitability of these NoSQL databases-documentoriented and key-value respectively-under realistic workloads and deployment conditions using serverless architecture on the Vercel platform. The application consists of modular microservices, including book suggestion and user authentication components, developed with React, Node.js, and Express.js. Performance metrics such as latency, load time, CPU and memory usage, throughput, and data transfer rate were collected using Apache JMeter and PerfMon. Results indicate that MongoDB outperforms Redis in initial load time (1.2 s vs. 2.7s) and resource efficiency, making it preferable for applications with complex queries and structured data. Conversely, Redis demonstrated significantly lower latency (7 ms vs. 50 ms), highlighting its strength in scenarios requiring high-speed responses, such as realtime messaging. Trade-offs between performance and resource consumption were analyzed, revealing MongoDB's suitability for infrastructure-constrained environments, and Redis's advantage in latency-sensitive contexts. This practical evaluation goes beyond conventional CRUD benchmarks, providing real-world insights through containerized deployment and controlled testing environments. The study contributes to guiding developers in selecting the most appropriate NoSQL backend for microservices architectures. Limitations include a small number of services and controlled testing conditions. Future work should extend the evaluation to broader microservice types, higher concurrency levels, and additional performance dimensions."

    "abstract": "Relation extraction is an important task for understanding relationships between entities, building knowledge graphs, and facilitating knowledge discovery. Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for relation extraction if a substantial amount of labeled data is available. However, acquiring extensive labeled data is generally challenging. Semi-supervised techniques for low-resource relation extraction, such as self-training, offer a promising solution by leveraging both limited labeled data and vast unlabeled data to mitigate this challenge. Traditional selftraining methods use a teacher-student framework, where a student is iteratively trained with pseudo-labels generated by the teacher. This may lead to noisy pseudo-labels and impact performance. To address this limitation, we introduce a new model called RE-AUM-LLM that generates high-quality pseudolabels using self-training combined with Area Under the Margin (AUM) and Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Llama 3.1. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results for lowresource relation extraction by comparison with several strong baselines. We will make the code publicly available to enable reproducibility and further research in this area."

However, both the traditional DNS systems have several security, privacy, and scalability issues because of the centralized nature. This paper describes the design and implementation of a Web3 decentralized DNS system on top of the blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart contracts. The Web3 DNS system distributes domain registration, resolution and management in a way that is transparent and unbreakably secured, scalable and insanely fast. It’s a system with integrated criticals such as Proof of Request (PoR) for logging all actions and rate limiting to stop abusing the system. In this paper we explore the root components of the Web3 DNS system such as: domain management via a smart contract, PoR logging and rate limiting. This Web3 DNS is tested with the performance tests and compared to the traditional DNS systems for the handling of domain related transactions with improved security and decentralization. Furthermore, blockchain usage in the system leads to the immutable and transparent record of all actions, decreasing the danger of DNS hijacking and other evil activities. This work tries to bring a robust, transparent and censorship resistant alternative to existing DNS infrastructures. Future work will attempt to scale the system and enhance the capability of interoperating with existing, legacy DNS infrastructure."

A performance evaluation of the SPI protocol was executed to quantify the frequency of data received by the master device with and without the integration of Hamming Codes as an additional mechanism to guarantee reliable data. Additional tests were executed to measure the data reliability for both SPI implementations resulting in zero errors on each case in a controlled environment. As it was expected, integrating Hamming code to SPI protocol reduces the frequency in which the master device receives the data, and therefore the user should decide if prefer more reliable data using mechanisms for error detection and correction or a higher frequency using a pure SPI protocol that also can provide reliable data in a low electromagnetic interference environment."

Cooperative robotics, particularly involving of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), presents significant opportunities for enhancing academic engagement by facilitating hands-on experimentation and active learning methodologies. However, traditional indoor positioning systems, such as GPS, are inadequate for controlled laboratory settings. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines a real-world laboratory environment with a simulation framework to enhance cooperative robotics education. The system utilizes Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for precise indoor positioning, enabling collaborative navigation between aerial and terrestrial robots. A key contribution of this study is the development and implementation of a dual-environment setup, comprising a physical testbed and a Webots-based simulation, allowing students and researchers to conduct safe and scalable experiments before real-world deployment. Experimental validation demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the trajectory accuracy of UAV and rovers in both simulated and physical settings. The results confirm that the system offers a reliable platform for robotics education, with trajectory execution error below 0.4 m and consistent synchronization between simulation and real-world tests, enabling students to develop practical skills in autonomous navigation, positioning technologies, and robotic collaboration. Furthermore, this integrated approach facilitates progressive learning by enabling the application of concepts from basic to advanced levels within the simulation before real-world implementation, supporting continuous educational development in emerging technologies.

To address these challenges, we propose a Self-Prompt Calibration Network based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SC-SAM). The SC-SAM achieves self-prompt by feeding mask prompts from a lightweight decoder into frozen prompt encoder. Output calibration is achieved through the proposed Cross-Probability Guided Calibration module, which employs cross-probability uncertainty as complementary guidance to refine final predictions via self-prompted outputs. Furthermore, to better preserve contextual and structural information across multiple scales, a scale-decoupled kernel mixture module is designed. Experimental results on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.02% and 1.34% in mIoU, highlighting its effectiveness. This study provides new insights into adapting SAM for domain-specific remote sensing segmentation tasks."

    "abstract": "Aperture efficiency is a critical performance metric for reconfigurable metasurface antennas (RMAs). In this work, a quasi-bit design framework is proposed that integrates microwave network theory with a quasi-bit strategy to enhance aperture efficiency across multiple beam directions while maintaining the simplicity of 1-bit configurations. Four distinct 1-bit unit cells are defined, with their reflection phases and target beam reference phases taken as optimization variables. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is employed to simultaneously optimize quantization efficiency across multiple scan angles, thereby determining the reflection phases and spatial arrangements of the unit cells. To efficiently realize these unit cells, an automated inverse design method based on microwave network theory is introduced to synthesize the desired electromagnetic responses into physical structures. Following this framework, a quasi-bit RMA is designed to improve aperture efficiency across six beam directions, achieving an enhancement of up to 44.7% at the optimized scan angles while maintaining comparable performance to conventional 1-bit designs at other scan angles. A 16×16 prototype has been fabricated and experimentally validated, confirming both the beam control capability and the practical feasibility of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "High-sensitivity fluorescence detection is critical across biomedical, environmental, and defense applications. While dielectric dimers enhance fluorescence by reducing the gap to obtain a strong electric field, their narrow gaps hinder quantum dot infiltration into high-field regions. To address this, we propose a silicon (Si) dimer metasurface that converts symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) into quasi-BIC (q-BIC) resonances through structural tuning, generating strong inter-dimer electric fields. This design achieves an excitation enhancement factor of 12272 compared to bare substrates, enabling strong light-matter interaction. Additionally, the metasurface enhances far-field emission by up to 20 times for randomly distributed quantum dots by directing radiative energy efficiently. These dual enhancements in excitation and emission overcome the limitations of conventional dielectric dimers, offering a robust platform for ultra-sensitive fluorescence detection. This advancement holds promise for advances in applications in related fields."

The edge-truncated patches are integrated with triangular microfluidic chips and liquid metal. This integration facilitates the polarization reconfiguration among left hand circular polarization (LHCP), right hand circular polarization (RHCP), and linear polarization (LP). Furthermore, while reconstructing the top edge-truncated patches, it is possible to reconfigure the feeding networks at the bottom. Specifically, the feeding networks within the antenna assembly are integrated with U-shaped microfluidic chips and liquid metal. This integration is designed to achieve a phase difference of 180° for each unit. Consequently, the antenna assembly can simultaneously achieve polarization and directivity reconfiguration. This liquid metal-based approach opens a new paradigm for designing antenna systems with low power consumption, enhanced gain performance, and adaptive beamforming capabilities, while offering significant potential for applications in 5G/6G communications and intelligent wireless communication systems."

    "abstract": "Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) integrating batteries and supercapacitors offer a promising solution to overcome the limitations of battery-only architectures in electric vehicles (EVs). By leveraging the high energy density of batteries and the high power density of supercapacitors, HESS can enhance power delivery, improve energy efficiency, and extend battery lifespan. The effectiveness of HESS, however, is largely determined by the energy management system (EMS) that coordinates power flow under dynamic driving conditions. Unlike existing reviews, this work addresses common gaps in the literature, including the lack of industrial energy storage component examples, limited coverage of recently developed EMS strategies, and insufficient analysis of renewable energy integration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of energy systems in EVs, focusing on EMS strategies and solar PV integration for battery–supercapacitor HESS. Rule-based, optimization-based, model predictive control (MPC), fuzzy logic control (FLC), and reinforcement learning (RL) methods are investigated and compared in terms of control performance, computational cost, adaptability, and real-time feasibility. The review also identifies research gaps and outlines future directions, emphasizing the need for intelligent, adaptive, and multi-objective EMS frameworks for next-generation EVs."

Firstly, by applying the funnel technique, the collision avoidance and communication range constraints between adjacent robots are uniformly transformed into formation error constraints, thereby eliminating the complex barrier Lyapunov functions in existing methods and reducing the complexity of controller design. Then, to mitigate the complexity explosion problem, an enhanced nonlinear filter with adaptive parameters is designed, which reduces the computational load while improving the convergence performance of the system. On this basis, the low-complexity safe FC scheme is constructed using broad fuzzy neural networks (BFNNs) and reinforcement learning techniques, achieving PT stability, optimality, avoiding collisions, and no overshoot behavior in formation errors. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control method are verified on the Speedgoat real-time target machine."

    "abstract": "Respiratory diseases are a major cause of death globally, placing a significant burden on healthcare services. Early-stage clinical decision-making is crucial for enabling personalized, prioritized treatment and more efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Clinicians can intervene proactively and develop appropriate treatment plans for patients when provided with vital information such as mortality prediction, deterioration detection, and length-of-stay prediction. To precisely predict such vitals, it is essential to leverage sequential information that is inherent in clinical variables. In this paper, we employ a unified framework for patient outcome forecasting in pneumonia patients. The proposed model utilizes clinical time-series data of varying lengths, along with static admission information, to effectively capture the sequential information of clinical variables. Additionally, we model the imbalanced distribution of mortality prediction and deterioration detection through weight constraints, and we account for the right-skewed distribution of length-of-stay data to enhance the robustness of the model. Furthermore, we develop a data splitting strategy to track dynamic changes in model performance at different timestamps, helping to bridge the gap between testing conditions and real-world scenarios. We conduct experiments on CAP-AI dataset that was obtained and collected from the University Hospitals of Leicester with the involvement of clinicians. It is based on real-world clinical data from patients admitted with pneumonia-related diagnoses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach whilst predicting patient outcomes in a clinical setting."

However, previous studies have identified weaknesses in the NeQuick topside model, particularly the underestimation of the plasmaspheric contribution to the total electron content (TEC). To address these shortcomings, the study aims to improve the NeQuick model’s empirical representation of electron density distribution in the topside ionosphere and plasmasphere. Radio occultation (RO) electron density profiles from COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 satellites are integrated with TEC measurements from the same mission derived from precise orbit determination (POD) antennas. A novel two-step optimization procedure is developed for the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i> parameter, which is critical for describing the plasmaspheric electron density.

The optimized <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i> parameter, derived from a dataset spanning from 2006 to 2018, demonstrates improved consistency with effective scale height observations from the Van Allen Probes.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has emerged as the predominant technique for predicting routability in Very-Large-Scale-Integrated (VLSI) circuits. However, it often struggles to generalize to various tasks and performs poorly when addressing inherent data imbalance issues in electronic design automation. Overcoming these challenges typically requires retraining or fine-tuning models, which poses significant difficulties for chip engineers who lack resources and expertise in neural network training. In light of this, we propose and address the universal problem of routability prediction for the first time. By framing this issue as a meta-learning scenario, we propose a Few-Shot Learning (FSL)-based approach, URoute, which adapts flexibly to new tasks by utilizing features of the query chip and labeled examples without additional training. To tackle the data imbalance problem, we further propose a meta-learning strategy based on importance sampling to optimize the model training process. To validate the generality and adaptability of URoute, we construct an FSL dataset based on CircuitNet and ISPD2015 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that URoute exhibits greater robustness and flexibility compared to existing methods when handling unseen routability prediction tasks, achieving competitive results."

    "abstract": "To facilitate the provision of primary frequency regulation (PFR) from active distribution networks (ADNs), this paper proposes a spatial–temporal coordination framework, where up-regulation (UR), down-regulation (DR) and voltage/var control (VVC) tasks are strategically allocated to electric vehicle (EV) clusters and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) through a three-stage implementation. In node-level assessment stage, node controllers assess the PFR and VVC capabilities of resources in parallel, with special attention to DPV generation uncertainty and time-coupled EV charging demand. In ADN-level dispatch stage, the distribution system operator (DSO) controller co-optimizes PFR scheme and VVC policy to assess the ADN's aggregate frequency support capability (FSC) and then optimally execute the assigned PFR task with voltage security guarantee. In online deployment stage, resources perform dispatched PFR scheme and suppress the PFR-induced voltage fluctuations with only local measurement. Simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can achieve economical and continuous demand-side PFR provision while reducing the negative impact of PFR service on the voltage quality of the ADNs."

Based on the Preissmann scheme, the proposed method introduces anisotropic damping terms without breaking the geometric structure of Maxwell’s equations. By employing a local 1-D (LOD) splitting strategy, the UPML is naturally embedded into the MS-FDTD method, avoiding corner or edge-specific treatments and simplifying implementation, all while preserving the original multisymplectic (MS) properties. A spectral stability analysis confirms that the method is unconditionally stable in three dimensions. Numerical experiments involving a perfectly electrically conducting (PEC) plate, multilayer dielectric slabs, and power distribution network and human brain tissues demonstrate the method’s outstanding absorption performance and accuracy, even under large Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. Compared to the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and commercial solvers, the proposed method shows clear advantages in structural preservation and stability, while each approach maintains its own strengths in terms of computational cost and modeling flexibility. Overall, the proposed method enhances the practical applicability of the MS-FDTD method for open-region electromagnetic problems, offering a robust and efficient solution for large-scale time-domain simulations."

    "abstract": "The penetration of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in the smart grid (SG) power network paradigm has widened the landscape of cyber threats aiming at disrupting the grid operations. The wider exposure of the communication infrastructure increases the vulnerability of smart grids towards cyber intrusions. The most common impactful intrusions (commonly referred to as false data injection attack (FDIA)) involve falsification of sensor measurement while it is being transmitted to the control centre. Among FDIAs, the load redistribution(LR) attack causes the maximum disruption on the grid operations without being detected at the control centre. During the LR attack, the intruder attempts to virtually manipulate the sensor information at different locations. Analyzing the cyber vulnerability of power networks demands identifying possible LR attack scenarios that disrupt the grid operations to the maximum extent. In this regard, the present work proposes monitoring metrics, Cyber Resiliency Index (CRI), Cyber Severity Index (CSI) and Cyber Market Index (CMI) to quantify the impact of measurement falsification through LR attack scheme, executed with minimum budget and resources. The attack design task has been framed as a multi-objective optimization based on the trade-off between the objectives of maximum disruption and minimum attack cost. A set of solutions (Pareto-front), each pertaining to a bus location for LR attack, is derived post-convergence of the optimization problem. The proposed metrics have been validated for different attack scenarios in a real-time environment."

A multifunctional UAV system for real-time environmental monitoring in agriculture landscapes is presented here. This drone has a Pixhawk flight controller and a variety of environmental sensors from which air quality using the MQ-135, soil moisture, temperature using DHT22, water pollution, and LIDAR-based distance sensors (VL53L0X) would be applied. Moreover, it has an SD card-associated black box for safe data storage, allows solar charging so it can have a much longer mission time, and permits autonomous water landing when necessary for better survivability in emergency situations. The UAV can provide accurate environmental data which could help farmers or environmental agencies in decision making with regards to irrigation, fertilization, or pollution control. The efficiency of capturing accurate sensors data is verified through test results that also show the solar charging-enabled extended mission endurance and miss emergency landings without damage to critical components. The cashless data integrity is ensured with the black box mechanism. The system is also far superior to conventional systems based on ground monitoring in terms of scalability, flexibility, and reduced cost.

This is achieved by combining KPM and SRM techniques and implementing the F -AHP and F-TOPSIS procedures, which are based on the best management criteria and the impact of the supplies they provide. The data indicates which supplier is best suited to developing a plan for the six types of supplies from the three maj or families studied. Similarly, eight suppliers are deemed in need of replacement, and the decision to discontinue relationships with some of them is made. Furthermore, it was discovered that the Lubricants II product lacked suitable suppliers, presenting an opportunity to establish new ties with other providers."

    "abstract": "It is estimated that millions of people from different parts of the world are suffering from breast cancer. As of 2022, it has one of the highest mortality rates. It symptomatized by the abnormal growth of breast tissue cells aggregating into malignant tumors. Because of this, the current study investigates quantum-enhanced machine learning models in hope of curing the disease in its earlier stages. In this case, breast cancer tumors are deemed benign or malignant using three different datasets—Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC), Mammographic Mass (MM) and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original), all of which are publicly accessible on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These datasets differ greatly in terms of size and the number of features that make it suitable for performance analysis of breast cancer classification. On the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) and WDBC datasets, Quantum Random Forest (QRF) has gained the maximum accuracy of 97% and 96%, respectively, suggesting superiority in high-dimensional feature sets. Moreover, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) showed promising results with 81% accuracy on the MM dataset. The latter result was achieved with the use of Explainable AI (XAI) approach with Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), which ensured interpretability and transparency of the quantum machine learning models. For each explanation LIME provided, there were important decision-altering features, like tumor size, lymph node involvement, degeneracy of malignancy and irradiation status, which were the primary determinants of the model’s choice. Such interpretability enhances trust in AI systems for medical diagnostics, as well as validating the outputs. Integrating quantum machine learning models with XAI techniques offers robust and interpretable frameworks for breast cancer classification, resulting in improved accuracy."

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating a vehicle's position is a key challenge in autonomous navigation, requiring real-time performance and robustness to sensor noise, outages, and unmodeled dynamics. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have shown promise as a data-driven, model-free alternative for various robotics and autonomous driving tasks. This work proposes an end-to-end DRL-based pipeline for vehicle localization using only proprioceptive sensor data, including IMU, speed, and steering angle, combined with estimates from an Extended Kalman Filter. The proposed system is built around a containerized architecture that enables simplified deployment from training in the CARLA simulator to real-time execution on embedded hardware. The approach is validated both in simulation and on a 1: 10 scale physical vehicle, demonstrating stable training convergence and real-time inference capabilities on resource-constrained platforms. While the model's accuracy is not yet sufficient for closed-loop operation, the results confirm the viability of the architecture and the training approach as a foundation for further development."

    "abstract": "Edge computing enables clouds to execute their applications closer to end-users. Even on untrusted edge devices, Arm TrustZone can securely run cloud applications in the secure world as trusted applications (TAs). Since the secure world has too high privileges, vulnerabilities in cloud applications could lead to the compromise of the entire system. To minimize the attack surface, it is desirable to run security-insensitive tasks in the normal world as unprivileged client applications (CAs). However, cooperation between CAs and TAs requires the use of the APIs specialized for TrustZone, which prevents flexible interactions. This paper proposes TZmediator to enable cooperative execution using standard POSIX APIs for a cloud application partitioned into two worlds. For inter-world seamless communications, TZmediator creates a shadow process in the normal world for each TA and delegates the invocation of POSIX APIs by a TA to the shadow process. Currently, it supports the message passing APIs, the shared memory API, and the signal API. If users require stronger isolation, TZmediator can execute security -sensitive tasks in TAs using WebAssembly. We have implemented TZmediator on OP- TEE and examined communication performance between CAs and TAs."

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for ultra-reliable, high-speed, and energy-efficient communication in next-generation wireless networks necessitates the development of advanced power management strategies. This research proposes an AI-enhanced cross-layer predictive power management framework for sustainable 6G networks, integrating artificial intelligence (AI), cross-layer optimization, predictive analytics, and wireless power transfer (WPT). The framework dynamically adjusts power allocation, scheduling, and beamforming using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and lightweight machine learning (ML) models to optimize energy efficiency across different network layers.By leveraging multi-dimensional cross-layer optimization, the proposed approach enables adaptive power control across PHY, MAC, and network layers, enhancing energy efficiency in multi-cell, multi-carrier environments. Additionally, predictive power management techniques are incorporated to anticipate traffic demands and optimize sleep scheduling for mobile LTE and 6G devices, reducing unnecessary power consumption. The integration of wireless power transfer (WPT) and hybrid power-splitting receivers further ensures continuous energy harvesting for IoT and edge computing applications.Preliminary analysis suggests that the proposed framework can achieve up to 30% improvement in energy efficiency compared to traditional static and reactive power allocation strategies. This research will contribute to the development of scalable, sustainable, and intelligent energy management solutions for 6G networks, enabling the realization of green communications, smart cities, and ultralow-power IoT systems."

    "abstract": "In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services."

The proposed system integrates photovoltaic solar power and a lithium-ion battery energy storage system to enhance energy reliability, reduce fuel consumption, and improve cost efficiency. A comprehensive methodology was applied to assess load profiles, solar resource potential, technical constraints, and environmental regulations. Geographic Information Systems and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis were used to identify optimal sites. Simulation results showed that the hybrid configuration reduced annual diesel consumption by 91.3%, from 570,730 liters to 49,650 liters, while supplying over 716 MWh/year from solar PV. The Net Present Cost (NPC) decreased to $2.73 million, the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) was reduced to $0.0961/kWh, and the system achieved an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 7.91% with a 9.05-year payback period. The BESS operated at 89.5% round-trip efficiency and enabled daily energy shifting and peak shaving. These results confirm that hybrid PV-BESS systems offer a viable, cost-effective solution for decarbonizing off-grid communities while enhancing operational flexibility and energy security."

    "abstract": "Apache Spark's performance is critically dependent on efficient in-memory computation; however, insufficient executor memory frequently results in costly disk spills, severely degrading performance. Traditional spill mitigation techniques, including static configuration tuning, reactive Adaptive Query Execution (AQE), and internal spill handling mechanisms, exhibit limitations in addressing the dynamic and fine-grained nature of memory pressure in complex and large-scale workloads. This paper introduces Proactive Spill Mitigation (PSM), a novel methodology designed to anticipate and mitigate memory spills in PySpark applications before they occur. PSM leverages real-time task and executor metrics, accessible via the Spark Listener API, as input to a machine learning model trained to predict the likelihood and potential severity of impending spills. Upon detecting a high spill risk, a control mechanism triggers preemptive actions, such as checkpointing intermediate results or dynamically adjusting partition counts, to alleviate memory pressure. Experimental evaluation using the TPC-DS and HiBench Sort benchmarks demonstrates that PSM significantly reduces both execution time and the volume of data spilled to disk across various cluster sizes, outperforming default Spark configurations, statically tuned setups, and configurations with AQE enabled. This work establishes the efficacy of predictive control for enhancing Spark's memory management and improving application performance in dynamic environments."

The purpose of this article is to present a description of a smart water management system that is powered by the Internet of Things (IoT) and has the objective of optimizing the distribution and use of water in rural regions. The use of data analytics, cloud computing, and wireless sensors allows for the measurement of water levels, the identification of leaks, and the management of an acceptable supply. All of these tasks may be completed simultaneously. The Internet of Things gives consumers and authorities the capacity to make well-informed decisions, which simultaneously reduces the amount of water that is wasted and improves sustainability while doing so."

    "abstract": "The human hand plays a fundamental role in daily activities and the development of fine motor skills, particularly during childhood; however, traumatic injuries or neurological disorders affecting hand joints can severely impair functionality and compromise the long-term quality of life in pediatric populations. Robotic gloves equipped with pneumatic actuators have emerged as promising tools to support rehabilitation in these cases, offering precise and adaptive assistance to restore movement. Despite their potential, current devices exhibit notable limitations, particularly in terms of durability and uniformity of pressure distribution in the actuators, which often result in premature material failure and reduced therapeutic effectiveness. This study aimed to optimize the design of pneumatic finger actuators for pediatric rehabilitation by evaluating how actuator geometry influences fatigue life and pressure performance. Using room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) Type 6 silicone for its favorable mechanical properties, three actuator designs were fabricated with polylactic acid (PLA) molds produced through 3D printing and subjected to fatigue, pressure, and deformation tests. The results showed that geometry had a substantial impact on performance: Design 1 withstood 3393 cycles at 62 kPa, whereas Design 2 failed after 1293 cycles at 51 kPa. Fatigue analysis confirmed that internal reinforcements and the distribution of stress concentration zones play a critical role in enhancing long-term durability."

Current approaches utilize computer vision software such as MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and movements. To bypass their limitations, we present a new CNN architecture that learns to automatically extract discriminative spatial-temporal features from raw video streams without the need for feature engineering. In contrast to LSTM networks, which are more commonly applied to sequential data, CNNs can take advantage of both spatial and temporal information efficiently and are thus well-suited to process dynamic hand motion. This architecture also facilitates quicker processing and real-time operation, which is essential for real-world applications. Moreover, by incorporating text-to-speech (TTS) translation, the system promotes accessibility by transforming identified gestures into spoken words, further reducing communication gaps. With the help of superior CNN-based models and multilingual language translators, the system proposes to serve India's multi-linguistic communities. The data is separated into 70% for training and 30% for testing, with an accuracy rate of 95% which is higher than the conventional method. This system has broad applications across public services, healthcare, and education, providing an assistive technology tool for better communication and the promotion of a more inclusive community."

This paper reports on the potential of high-resolution multispectral and hyperspectral satellite imagery for monitoring crop health throughout the growing season, including above-ground accumulated biomass, chlorophyll content, and stress. The use of satellite imaging and its analysis using advanced algorithms coupled with machine learning technologies allows for the real-time evaluation of anomalies in growth, which ensures timely interventions and hence better management of resources to counter any possible yield loss in a relatively shorter timeframe. What is more, this technology can contribute to precision irrigation and the accurate control of both water and nutrients (fertilizers and pesticides) at the same time, it helps in reducing environmental degradation as well as in sustainable production. Case examples are provided for a range of agricultural contexts to illustrate how the use of satellite imagery can inform decisions, as well as crop management strategies. The paper reviews the current status of neural network applications, demonstrating incredible progress, but also identifies some drawbacks and slowly assesses its future potential by improving resolution, lowering costs, and data integration from multiple sources.

Individual healthcare institutions often lack sufficient or high-quality data to train reliable machine learning models, and privacy regulations prevent data sharing. To address this, we use federated learning, a technique that allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train a model without sharing local data. Our focus is on horizontal federated learning, where each participant trains a local model on its own data. These models are updated locally, then aggregated periodically to improve the global model’s performance. Aggregation typically relies on weighted averaging, with different strategies for assigning weights. We enhance this process by incorporating uncertainty-aware aggregation using the Choquet integral, a method for information fusion. And also by integrating uncertainty measures such as entropy, we aim to improve both model performance and robustness. We also investigate how local model parameters are affected by their performance and by uncertainties present in the data."

    "abstract": "Timely and accurate diagnosis of acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures in X-ray images is critical for initiating prompt and effective treatment, preventing potential neurological damage and long-term disability. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved medical imaging analysis, providing sophisticated tools to assist clinicians in diagnosing acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures. Nonetheless, detecting these fractures through imaging remains challenging due to the complex overlapping of bony structures in the thoracolumbar region, variability in fracture patterns, and often subtle nature of these injuries. Additionally, the limited availability and sometimes poor quality of medical images further complicate accurate AI-based detection. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a transfer learning model optimized for recognizing acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures from a small set of low-quality X-ray images. The model starts with a feature extraction model that analyzes multiple texture features of X-ray images. It then employs a Vision Transformer Detector (ViTDet) combined with a faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) to recognize fractures efficiently. To enhance its performance on small datasets, the model employs a transfer learning approach for training. Extensive experiments with a large dataset of real-world images have shown that this model can effectively recognize acute thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures from low-quality images, outperforming professionals with specialized knowledge in some cases."

To generalize this approach, a theoretical framework is established that incorporates concepts such as phase smoothing region, deflection phase, intrinsic phase, and initial phase modulation, ultimately extending the rotation-based method into a universal initial phase control scheme. Simulation and measurement results confirm that replacing conventional small-ratio power dividers with 1-to-N<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub> equal-dividers preserves low sidelobe levels in vertical scanning, maintains original horizontal scanning performance, and achieves channel capacity parity with full-channel systems.

    "abstract": "This article presents a wideband and high-gain pattern reconfigurable antenna for dynamic IoT communication networks in smart indoor environments of 5G FR1 n78 band (3.3 to 3.8 GHz). The proposed antenna enables adaptive beam steering and coverage optimization for diverse IoT device deployments in smart buildings and intelligent indoor spaces. The antenna comprises a direct-fed square patch and a reconfigurable parasitic layer that dynamically adjusts to varying IoT traffic patterns and device locations. The parasitic layer consists of a parasitic patch and four pairs of bracket-shaped strips to facilitate intelligent beam steering toward different IoT clusters with minimal steering variability across a wide operating bandwidth. To achieve context-aware beam pattern reconfigurability, each bracket-shaped strip pair is incorporated with a PIN diode to alter the surface current distribution, enabling real-time adaptation to IoT network topology changes. The proposed antenna supports eight directional IoT communication zones as well as broad and narrow 3-dB beamwidth reconfigurability to optimize coverage for heterogeneous IoT device densities. A prototype demonstrates an impedance bandwidth of 21.58% with |S<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>| < –10dB from 3.1 to 3.85 GHz, and a measured realized gain of 8.8 dBi, making it suitable for energy-efficient IoT communications and smart environment applications."

    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into traffic systems, the interaction between different types of vehicles presents a significant challenge for cooperative decision-making, particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs coexist with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Among various scenarios, highway on-ramp merging is a critical and complex one where effective interaction is essential for ensuring traffic safety and efficiency, and decisions of AVs and HVs should be made efficiently. In this paper, we propose a Game-Theoretic Reinforcement Learning (GTRL)-based vehicle behavior interaction framework designed for various merging scenarios in mixed traffic environments. This framework includes Stackelberg leader-follower interactions between AVs and HVs, as well as Nash cooperative interactions between vehicles of the same type, such as AV-AV or HV-HV. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ the Bi-level Reinforcement Learning (Bi-RL) method and Safe Multi-Agent Deep Q-Network (MADQN) method to address two distinct types of interaction problems. A gym-based simulation environment is developed to evaluate four interaction scenarios between vehicles in mixed traffic. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the potential of the GTRL-based behavior interaction framework to adapt to the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicle interactions."

    "abstract": "Endoscopic capsules have emerged as a promising technique for minimally invasive procedures, offering reduced patient discomfort and eliminating the need for external connections. However, integrating a biopsy mechanism into these capsules requires multiple internal magnets, which complicates magnetic localization. This paper addresses the six-degree-of-freedom magnetic localization of a biopsy-capable endoscopic capsule containing two magnets with opposite dipoles and conventional forceps. While using two magnets may offer benefits, it introduces significant technical hurdles in magnetic field interpretation and algorithmic robustness. The magnetic localization is performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. However, since Levenberg-Marquardt is sensitive to the initial guess, we propose a novel method using an equivalent magnetic dipole model and analytical equations to determine an appropriate initial guess. Additionally, due to the capsule’s magnetic configuration, the magnetic field strength decreases rapidly as distance from the magnetometers increases. So, to achieve accurate localization across all samples with different orientations in the workspace, we employ two perpendicular magnetometer arrays. Experimental results demonstrate an average position error of 3.2 ± 1.2 mm and an orientation error of 4.7 ± 2.8° for a capsule containing two magnets with volumes of 280.39 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> and 84.823 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>, respectively.

    "abstract": "Railway tracks are critical to social infrastructure, and their maintenance is essential for operational safety. Glued Insulated Rail Joints (GIRJs) are vital for railway signal control, where the insulator’s thickness helps prevent signal failures. This paper addresses detecting anomalies in GIRJ insulator thickness using images captured by devices on operational trains. Due to various factors, the insulator is not always clearly visible, and standard computer vision methods often struggle. In severe cases, judgments cannot be made from the image alone, requiring the system to return “unable to determine.” If these cases are rare, they can be manually inspected, still lowering overall inspection costs. We tackle this by framing the task as a one-dimensional regression problem, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the boundary between the insulator and rail, while also estimating prediction uncertainty. Experiments with real-world data show that the model is accurate enough for practical use, even with challenging images. Additionally, we propose a robust method for detecting GIRJs in long-range railway images. This system is now operational in railway inspections."

    "abstract": "London's famous \"tube map\" is an iconic piece of design and perhaps represents the schematic visualization style most well-known to the general public: its octolinearity has become the de facto standard for transit maps around the world. Making a good schematic transit map is challenging and labour-intensive, and has attracted the attention of the optimization community. Much of the literature has focused on mathematically defining an optimal drawing and algorithms to compute one. However, achieving these \"optimal\" layouts is computationally challenging, often requiring multiple minutes of runtime. Crucially, what it means for a map to be good is actually highly dependent on factors that evade a general formal definition, like unique landmarks within the network, the context in which a map will be displayed, and the preference of the designer and client. Rather than attempting to make an algorithm that produces a single high-quality and ready-to-use metro map at great cost, we propose it is more fruitful to support rapid layout iteration by a human designer, providing a workflow that enables efficient exploration of a wider range of designs than could be done by hand, and iterating on these designs. To this end we identify steps in the design process of schematic maps that are tedious to do by hand but are algorithmically feasible, and present a framework around a simple linear program that computes network layouts almost instantaneously given a fixed direction for every connection. These connection directions are decided by a designer in a graphical user interface with several interaction methods and a number of quality-of-life features demonstrating the flexibility of the framework; the implementation is available as open source."

The incorporation of 5G technology with Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) presents itself as a promising framework to meet these requirements. However, the relatively lower computational capacity of MEC compared to central cloud servers poses substantial challenges in efficiently scheduling applications associated with autonomous connected vehicles (ACV). This manuscript presents a comprehensive scheduling framework aims at optimizing the allocation of vehicular applications on MEC hosts based on various criteria, including physical distance, traffic density, resource availability, and computational demand. We have developed five heuristic algorithms—<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BSR</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">THS</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FFA</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SFA</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FAS</i>—to address the intrinsic NP-hard problem. To further enhance the quality of the solutions obtained, we propose a novel Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) mechanism that utilizes the proposed heuristics as initial solutions to explore alternative execution schedules. This approach results in superior alternatives: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BSR</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">THS</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FFA</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SFA</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FAS</i>. Experimental evaluations conducted across 1, 800 problem instances and 45 distinct (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n<sub>app</sub></i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n<sub>vm</sub></i>) pairs demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the VNS-based methods.

These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing resource utilization and reducing execution delays for ACV applications within MEC environments.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid intelligent system for customer retention in the Peruvian telecommunications sector, combining a Bayesian classifier and a knowledge-based agent within an event-driven architecture. The system can identify users at high risk of churn in near real-time and generate personalized retention recommendations, achieving an average latency of 2 seconds and computational complexity of O(1) for prediction and O(r × c) for rule evaluation. The solution follows the CRISP-DM methodology, processing billing, usage, complaints, and top-up data through big data tools such as Kafka and Spark. It also offers explainability through an editable decision table designed for business experts. In tests using 5,000 simulated records, the classifier achieved an F1-score of 0.76 for the churn class, demonstrating high sensitivity despite class imbalance. Simulations confirm that the system optimizes incentive allocation, reduces churn, and enables fast decision-making without requiring major investments. This proposal presents a viable and scalable alternative for emerging environments with limited infrastructure, positioning itself as an effective explainable AI solution for real-time personalization and improved commercial sustainability for telecom operators."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building upon a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, HyperKD distills knowledge from Prithvi (a ViT-based MAE geospatial foundation model trained on lower-dimensional multispectral data) into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery. HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel alignment, spatial featureguided masking, and an enhanced loss function tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction, underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery."

    "abstract": "Many companies provide their customers with digital services for analytical purposes that are backed by modern expert machine learning models specifically trained for individual appliances. These models are often easy to train, but the deployment and operation of numerous individual machine learning models is a resource-intensive challenge. Due to hidden features in the individual appliances, consolidating all expert models into one model is often not possible. However, certain groups of models with similar appliances usually can be combined without (significant) loss in performance. To find these groups without knowledge of the actual hidden features, this paper proposes the consolidation algorithm ModelForge, which is based on a novel embedding strategy for model clustering. The Prediction Loss strategy embeds arbitrary models into Euclidean space in a way that close models share similar properties and can, therefore, effectively be consolidated. We validate ModelForge across four diverse domains, which are energy forecasting, timeseries anomaly detection, weather postprocessing, and house price prediction, to show that it yields more accurately consolidated models than previous works and alternative embedding strategies."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling financial data as networks, effectively capturing both individual attributes and complex relationships. However, their inherent message-passing and aggregation operations introduce significant inference latency, limiting their applicability in latency-sensitive domains such as finance, healthcare, and robotics. Recent efforts have attempted to mitigate this limitation by distilling GNN knowledge into more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While promising in reducing inference costs, existing GNN-to-MLP distillation approaches face three critical challenges: (1) reliance on labeled data, (2) limited robustness to noisy or perturbed inputs due to the absence of structural information, and (3) the existence of representational bias. To address these issues, we propose REFINE, a novel self-supervised GNN-to-MLP knowledge distillation framework. Our method enhances model stability and fairness through structure-free feature augmentations, including noise injection and counterfactual generation. Extensive experiments on two real-world financial datasets and one social network benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing distillation baselines, achieving a favorable trade-off between predictive utility, stability, and fairness."

    "abstract": "A robotic arm and a cheap stereo-vision camera would be the basis of an automated fruit harvesting system, according to this idea. While the robotic arm physically plucks the fruits, the stereo-vision camera detects their color, distance, and location. A prototype served as the basis for the harvesting robot. Autonomous harvester in the two-dimensional space was accomplished through the combination of the harvesting robot with a moving platform. The fruit-harvesting robot approached the desired fruit from the side of the road using its three degrees of freedom cylindrical form. Motor Drivers, DC motors, and ARDUINO NANO all contributed to reduced power usage. In controlled laboratory settings, the whole system was evaluated with fruits exposed to consistent light. Separate development of the robot and the moving platform is possible for future work, and the system will be evaluated and enhanced in traditional outdoor agricultural settings"

Conventionally, identifying these diseases involves inspecting manually, an action that is time consuming and relies on specialist knowledge. To counteract this, we introduce a Mango Leaf Disease Detection System based on using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model, with PyTorch used for model implementation to provide precise identification and diseases. The system analyzes mango leaf images and labels common diseases such as anthracnose, powdery mildew, bacterial spots and so forth. Leveraging the use of the ViT model that retains minute details in an image via self-attention mechanisms, our solution has an accuracy of 99.1%. Experimental outcomes indicate that the ViT model excels at classification, rendering the system a viable tool for early disease identification and improved crop management."

The use of traditional and unresponsive approaches limits student engagement, discourages personal organization, and hinders collaborative work. In this context, we present “UR Plan,” a web platform that implements the agile SCRUM methodology adapted to the academic environment, allowing students to organize their tasks using visual boards, apply iterative planning, receive constant feedback, and manage their progress autonomously. This solution seeks to optimize time management, collaboration, and team participation, which are fundamental aspects of the university learning process. The pilot validation carried out at a private university in Peru revealed a significant improvement in planning, task completion, communication between students, and overall perception of academic performance, supporting the viability of using SCRUM as a replicable model in educational environments."

We developed a simulation environment in C++ to model a navigation system fusing IMU and camera data, subjecting it to different measurement delays. The results indicate that the FR method achieves superior accuracy and robustness, nearly eliminating delay-induced errors, but at a significant computational cost. The ME method offers a more computationally efficient alternative but exhibits numerical instability with larger delays. This analysis provides crucial insights for selecting an appropriate delay compensation strategy based on system-specific accuracy and latency requirements."

The system is given by a Raspberry Pi 5 connected by HTTP communication to the ESP32 microcontroller the movement of the robot. During the tests, it was observed an adequate detection of the camera placed on the AGV robot applying Gaussian filter and normalization to eliminate noise, with an average error in linear displacement of 0.67 cm at distances of 0.5 m, 1 m and 2 m. Meanwhile, it presents an average error in rotational displacement of 0.41° at angles of ±45° and ±90°.

Three such measures are the smallest size of a string attractor, the smallest size of a bidirectional macro scheme, and the smallest size of a straight-line program. While a vast variety of implementations for heuristically computing approximations exist, exact computation of these measures has received little to no attention. In this paper, we present MAX-SAT formulations that provide the first non-trivial implementations for exact computation of smallest string attractors, smallest bidirectional macro schemes, and smallest straight-line programs. Computational experiments show that our implementations work for texts of length up to a few hundred for straight-line programs and bidirectional macro schemes, and texts even over a million for string attractors."

    "abstract": "Computing in emerging non-volatile memory (eNVM)-based accelerators is promising for efficient matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), and many previous accelerators compute at operating unit (OU) granularity to mitigate the program variation effect. Unfortunately, computing at OU granularity, like the entire array, still suffers from the impacts of non-idealities, i.e., the IR drop and nonlinear I-V effect (IR-NIV). These nonidealities significantly compromise computing accuracy. Even worse, the dependence of IR-NIV undermines the effectiveness of existing IR drop and nonlinear I-V compensation methods, as well as their combination. The IR drop first reduces the voltage across an eNVM cell, which in turn causes a variation in the cell conductance due to nonlinear I-V. Neither the IR drop nor the nonlinear I-V compensator can acquire the actual voltage or cell conductance due to the dependence of IR-NIV, leading to inaccurate results. This paper proposes ICON-NIV, a generalized method for mitigating the impacts of both IR drop and nonlinear I-V effect in eNVM-based accelerators. First, we build an OU-level IR drop model by removing wire resistances inside the OU, and simplify the complex nonlinear I-V model of the cell into the optimal segmented linear interpolation while maintaining sufficient precision. With the aid of the simplifications above, we derive the theoretical compensation math expression for the output result considering the coupling effects of IR-NIV, and build the corresponding compensation circuit. The compensation expression uses the output of the OU column to calculate the actual cell voltage with the simplified OU-level IR drop model. And with the aid of the simplified cell I-V model, the actual cell conductance under the impacts of the nonlinear I-V effect is calculated using the actual cell voltage. After acquiring the actual cell voltage and conductance, ICON-NIV can precisely compensate for output loss. Moreover, the compensation expression takes the input and data pattern of an OU as arguments instead of the specific application features, which is applicable to all kinds of applications. Further, we pipe the compensation circuit into multiple stages to increase throughput. Experiments show that ICON-NIV can mitigate the IR-NIV problem when computing in the eNVM crossbar array at OU granularity, restoring inference accuracy by 3.03% ∼ 71.90% (for neural networks and naive Bayes), and achieving a reduction in mean-squared error by 1014 × (for scientific computing), compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The latency of each stage of the compensation circuit is 7.21 ns, which closely matches the computation latency of the original OU operation."

This study offers practical insights into when spatial graph structure adds value beyond temporal context, utilizing real-world data and a transparent evaluation. We compare Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models for hourly EV-charging energy forecasting, based on 145,778 sessions recorded in Boulder, Colorado (2018–2023). After preprocessing and temporal alignment, temporal covariates (hour, day, month, year) and, when applicable, ZIP-code indicators were engineered. LSTMs were trained with 1 h and 24 h input windows, with or without ZIP features, and evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation. GCNs operated on hourly node–time tensors with a dense adjacency (no self-loops) and were trained on an 80/20 temporal split, using a 1% subsample for tractability. All models used Adam (lr = 0.005), early stopping, and ReduceLROnPlateau. Temporal context was the main driver of LSTM accuracy: 24 h inputs outperformed 1 h, while ZIP features improved only the shorter window. For GCNs, depth and node features shaped performance: a 2-layer GCN with ZIP features achieved the lowest RMSE (4.75 kWh), whereas a 6-layer GCN without node features reached the lowest MAE (2.46 kWh). Despite higher computational cost, GCNs captured spatial coupling effectively. Overall, 24 h LSTMs provide a strong and efficient baseline, while GCNs add value when spatial correlations are relevant. A hybrid GCN–LSTM architecture is a promising next step to jointly leverage spatial and temporal dependencies."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a low-cost de-embedding method for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) on-chip applications. For conventional de-embedding methods, a trade-off between applicable frequencies and dummy quantity is needed. To address such constraints, a physics-based vector-fitting (VF) and convolutional neural network (CNN)-enabled Thru-only de-embedding method (PVCT de-embedding method) is proposed. By incorporating machine learning (ML), high de-embedding accuracy using only one dummy is obtained for this approach. The physics-based VF technique, which can accurately characterize high-frequency parasitic effects, is used to construct lumped equivalent circuits of the fixture and thru dummy. To better approximate real-world embedding scenarios, probe contact impedance is also incorporated using polynomial models. Benefiting from the non-EM equivalent models, a fast and physically meaningful dataset generation is carried out using Monte-Carlo analysis, which accounts for processing tolerances. 1D-CNNs implementing the curve-to-curve mapping concept are used to efficiently train a Thru-to-fixture prediction model. Once the fixture response is determined, cascade-based de-embedding can be performed. Simulation results obtained using three different fixtures validate the feasibility of the PVCT method, demonstrating excellent prediction accuracy with the coefficient of determination surpassing 0.99. Furthermore, a single-end inductor and a differential transformer, together with their de-embedding dummies, were fabricated and verified to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed de-embedding method up to 67 GHz (instrumental limitation)."

However, existing methods generally emphasize the low-rankness of background and the sparsity of targets within the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) framework, which may overlook the intrinsic gradient prior information existed in background. To address the challenges of complex background estimation and accurate small target detection, we propose a gradient prior-guided deep unfolding network, termed the correlated total variation network (CTVNet). First, we introduce a correlated total variation regularization to simultaneously characterize the low-rankness and local smoothness of the background, and transform it into the estimation of gradient maps. Subsequently, we employ a multi-scale feature fusion network to thoroughly extract gradient priors, replacing the complex and limited analytical computation of gradient correlations. Finally, we unfold the designed iterative algorithm using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) into a learnable network, where each module corresponds to a specific operator within the iterative process, and all parameters are learnable. By training the network end-to-end, the learnable modules can be automatically optimized to better separate the background and the target. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms while exhibiting superior performance and generalization capabilities on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy and nonlinear loads introduces complex and non-stationary power quality disturbances (PQDs), posing significant challenges to accurate monitoring and diagnosis in modern power systems. Effective time-frequency analysis is essential for identifying these disturbances. However, existing methods often rely on manual empirical parameter tuning, exhibit limited adaptability, and suffer from poor energy concentration, particularly for high-frequency components. To address these limitations, this study proposes the multi-objective optimization-based S-transform (MOOST), which leverages the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to adaptively tune the Gaussian window parameters. Unlike prior methods that optimize a single criterion, MOOST employs a dual-objective framework by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) to preserve signal amplitude fidelity and minimizing the energy concentration measure (ECM) to enhance high-frequency component localization. This enables a principled and data-driven trade-off between time and frequency resolution. Extensive experiments across various PQD scenarios, including voltage sags, harmonics, flickers, and oscillatory transients, demonstrate that MOOST outperforms both the standard S-transform and improved S-transform. The results validate MOOST as an adaptive, accurate, and noise-resilient tool for PQD analysis, with strong potential for real-time intelligent grid monitoring."

In recent years, with the rapid development and popularization of text-to-image generation models, many generated images have been disseminated through the Internet, thus making generated images ideal covers for steganography. Given that the distribution of generated images is more easily modeled than natural images, steganographic methods based on generated images exhibit higher security. Nevertheless, these methods typically require white-box access to the generative model, while contemporary popular generative models are black-box models. We observed that slight modifications in the input parameters of black-box image generative models result in subtle differences between generated images, offering new camouflage advantages for image steganography. Based on this observation, we propose an image steganography method based on the fluctuation of generative models. This approach leverages the fluctuation of image generative models, disguising stego images to appear as if they were generated by the parameter fluctuations of the generative model. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods when facing steganalysis attacks, significantly enhancing steganographic security without compromising image quality."

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive neurological disorder that impairs motor control and coordination due to brain injury or abnormalities before, during, or shortly after birth. Although robotic gait training can improve overall gait patterns in CP, interventions targeting the ‘foot rockers’ motion, essential for stable weight transfer and effective push-off, have received limited attention. In this study, five adults with CP were recruited to train on a robotic treadmill system in which controlled downward forces were applied to the pelvis during walking, promoting implicit motor learning to develop an improved foot rockers strategy. Following this, during overground walking, participants received distinct real-time auditory cues at heel strike and push-off, providing self-awareness feedback to reinforce and maintain the foot rockers pattern acquired during treadmill training. Post-training analyses reported increased Tibialis Anterior activation during early stance, enhancing dorsiflexion and heel strike, and greater Soleus and Gastrocnemius engagement in late stance for stronger push-offs (p < 0.05). These functional gains were reflected in key spatiotemporal metrics: longer step length, greater toe clearance, a reduced stance percentage, and a shorter double stance time (p < 0.05). Participants also exhibited increased range of motion of the foot and increased knee and hip extension throughout stance, reflecting a more upright lower limb (p < 0.05). Survey responses confirmed that participants acknowledged the resistive treadmill training for strengthening their muscles and influencing their walking patterns, and reported that the auditory biofeedback enhanced their awareness of heel-to-toe contact. Participants emphasized the necessity of incorporating both interventions, highlighting its potential as a promising approach to improving foot rockers and overall gait pattern in adults with CP."

    "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution for automating railway inspections due to its high mobility, flexible deployment, and reduced labor cost. In this paper, we investigate UAV-assisted railway inspections, which include object recognition, humidity monitoring, and critical infrastructure modeling, each with distinct data volumes and computational requirements. Particularly, we introduce a UAV-assisted railway inspection framework. Different types of sensors are divided into several clusters. The UAV departs from the hive, flies over each cluster to collect their computational requirements, and performs task offloading before returning to the hive. This process is formulated as a joint optimization problem of trajectory planning and task offloading to minimize the weighted sum of latency and energy consumption. Considering the constrained computing and storage capabilities of UAVs, it is crucial but challenging to develop a lightweight yet high-performing solution for the multi-objective optimization problems. As such, a novel <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</u>rtificial General Intelligence (AGI)-<underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</u>riented <underline xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</u>ransformer (AoT) algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AoT algorithm outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of trajectory length and average offloading cost."

However, the limited force output of soft actuators has hindered their broader adoption. In this study, a lobster-tail-inspired high-force-output soft pneumatic bending actuator (SPBA) is developed, featuring a soft deformable body and a rigid kirigami limiting shell. The SPBA, with a radius of 10 mm, can generate forces of approximately 22 N at an internal pressure of 0.1 MPa and 36.43 N at 0.16 MPa. An analytical model based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, incorporating a hyperelastic material model, has been constructed to predict the deformation and force of the actuated SPBA. This model demonstrates good agreement with simulated and experimental results. For assistance, a soft robotic gripper with four SPBAs can lift a weight of 5.38 kg at 0.26 MPa. For rehabilitation, an SPBA-based hand exoskeleton has been developed, demonstrating significant effectiveness in mitigating hand spasticity following strokes. This study introduces a novel SPBA design with promising potential for future applications in grasping, assistance, and rehabilitation."

Understanding how LLMs internally represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel Identification ⇒ Interpretation ⇒ Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest, interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs, ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM features.

In this paper, a multi-group joint multicast and unicast downlink system is considered, where users are divided into different groups. A user grouping policy based on joint services and channel conditions is investigated, and a sum-rate maximization problem for the downlink RSMA system is formulated. Furthermore, the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) is introduced to improve the extremely poor user channel conditions. Then a joint optimization framework based on alternating optimization (AO) for user grouping, phase adjustment, and resource allocation in STAR-RIS-assisted RSMA system is proposed, where successive convex approximation (SCA) and the projected gradient method (PGM) serve as key optimization algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that an appropriate user grouping policy fully exploits the performance of RSMA, and the introduction of STAR-RIS significantly further enhances the system capacity across various channel scenarios. Notably, when multiple users experience poor channel conditions, STAR-RIS effectively improves the channel conditions and incorporates them into RSMA groups, further boosting overall system performance."

    "abstract": "In reluctance machines, repeated evaluations of complex topologies for geometric scaling make electromagnetic design optimization challenging. Accurate modeling requires capturing nonlinearities due to frequent operation in the saturated regime. This paper presents a grey-box magnetic modeling approach for variable flux reluctance machines (VFRMs). The proposed method combines the geometry-scaling flexibility and computational efficiency of the harmonic model (HM) with finite element method (FEM)-based data, to account for magnetic saturation effects in electromagnetic scaling. The proposed method constructs a dataset by computing the airgap magnetic field distribution for a range of current excitation values and selected geometric parameters that influence saturation. A non-parametric and probabilistic machine learning model, i.e. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), is used to learn the discrepancy between the Fourier series (FS) coefficients of the airgap flux density obtained from HM and FEM. The trained model is used to correct the FS coefficients of the HM, allowing it to emulate FEM-level accuracy without requiring full simulations for each design point. The method is demonstrated on a 12-stator and 10-rotor pole VFRM. Results show that the proposed approach enables fast yet accurate performance prediction in a varying saturation behavior. The proposed grey-box modeling approach also enables training towards various magnetic behavior patterns typically encountered in electrical machine scaling."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to estimate the action to take given a (time-varying) state, with the goal of maximizing a cumulative reward function. Predominantly, there are two families of algorithms to solve RL problems: value-based and policy-based methods, with the latter designed to learn a probabilistic parametric policy from states to actions. Most contemporary approaches implement this policy using a neural network (NN). However, NNs usually face issues related to convergence, architectural suitability, hyper-parameter selection, and underutilization of the redundancies of the state-action representations (e.g. locally similar states). This paper postulates multilinear mappings to efficiently estimate the parameters of the RL policy. More precisely, we leverage the PARAFAC decomposition to design <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tensor low-rank</i> policies.

We leverage the understanding capability of large language models to simplify the complex scene knowledge. Then, we can filter out irrelevant descriptions and keep those relevant to the target objects involved by the referring expression. Furthermore, we propose a Scene Knowledge Reasoning Network (SKRN). Our SKRN extracts features from both referring expressions and scene knowledge and employs an attention mechanism to fully utilize them for reasoning. This enhances the model’s ability to handle scene knowledge and ultimately improves the localization accuracy. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our data simplification scheme and the proposed SKRN."

Only the amplitude taper that corresponds to the relative individual analog subarrays is applied in the analog beamforming domain, while the rest of the taper is applied using digital beamformingcoefficients. Based on a given array size, number of beams, and the desired sidelobe suppression level, the number of analog subarrays and the beamforming integrated circuit (BFIC) component characteristics are optimally selected. An improved BFIC module is recommended that has less analog pre-amplification and a smaller dynamic range of variable attenuator steps. For concept demonstration, a benchmark analog beamforming and hybrid beamforming SatCom architecture, without this improvement, are simulated using a joint signal and power consumption analysis. For a 32 × 32 element array with 2 simultaneous beams and 30 dB side lobe tapering, the analog benchmark and hybrid benchmark (with 64 subarrays) are simulated to have a power consumption of 50.1 W and 66.5 W, respectively, A similar hybrid beamforming architecture with modified BFIC modules is shown to have a total power consumption of 40.3 W, less than both benchmarks. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the system is conducted to illustrate how power consumption is influenced by the chosen number of subarrays with respect to the targeted sidelobe suppression, array size, number of beams and number of ADC bits."

This sliding mechanism minimizes boundary effects and reduces the number of blocks required for processing. The framework also incorporates external sensor data for context-aware range bin selection and includes an analytical formulation for optimal block size selection.

Guided ultrasonic waves (GUWs) offer a promising non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique due to their ability to propagate throughout long distances while being sensitive to material defects. This work presents the characterization of experimental GUW propagation features in CFRP and GFRP laminates, providing a comparative assessment of wave behavior in these materials. Experiments were conducted using piezoelectric transducers to generate and receive guided ultrasonic waves under varying excitation frequencies, plate thickness, and transducer arrangement. Key parameters, such as phase and group velocities, and attenuation, were analyzed to identify the impact of fiber type, layup orientation, and internal structural differences on wave propagation. The results indicate that CFRP exhibits lower attenuation and more substantial mode dispersion than GFRP, attributed to its higher stiffness and anisotropy. As a result, CFRP shows better wave transmission with lower attenuation, allowing long-range ultrasonic inspection. This study also provides valuable insights for developing ultrasonic inspection methodologies based on different fiber orientations and multiple laminated composite materials (CFRP and GFRP)."

The “H” sheets exhibited the longest life, followed by the “M” sheets, and the “L” sheets, all outperforming Cu. At 390 MPa. “H” Cu-Zr's fatigue life was ∼3 times that of Cu. Both the Cu-Zr and the Cu showed cyclic hardening. The presence of Zirconium improved fatigue life by stabilizing microstructure and retarding the formation of cracks during fatigue cycling, thus positioning Cu-Zr alloys as much stronger candidates than Cu for resistive magnet conductors."

    "abstract": "Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems are valued for their interpretability and flexibility, yet scaling them to high-dimensional data remains challenging. On the antecedent side, computing firing strengths with the product T-norm often results in ineffective activations, undermining rule utilization. On the consequent side, classical least-squares and gradient-based training may generalize poorly without additional regularization. Thus, an efficient and effective training algorithm is required to strike a balance between generalization and precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose a high-dimensional adaptive uniform membership function (HDAUMF) that adapts the width parameter using a theoretically motivated lower bound on the Gaussian width. By incorporating an activation radius to regulate the activation distribution, HDAUMF improves the effectiveness of rule activation. Building on this, a variant of the Kaczmarz method is extended to learn consequent weights of multioutput TSK models, which is further enhanced by a dual residual strategy to accelerate convergence. To mitigate the computational burden of matrix operations, a partitioned update scheme is designed, giving rise to the dual residual iterated projection (DRIP) algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that convergence under the dual residual strategy yields the minimum-norm least-squares solution, thereby supporting robust generalization. Combining these advancements, a novel iterated projection TSK fuzzy system (IPTSK) is developed. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed methods achieve competitive performance in tackling high-dimensional problems."

    "abstract": "The offshore energy industry faces challenges in maintaining ageing infrastructure, with over half of North Sea platforms past their 25-year design life. This creates a need for scalable inspection methods beyond traditional manual reviews. We present a collaborative Human-AI framework that assists in detecting structural defects whilst preserving expert oversight under challenging marine conditions. Our two-stage system first employs a lightweight classifier to filter video frames by risk level. High-risk frames are then analysed by a modified Pyramid Attention Network that performs precise defect localisation. Experts validate the results at both stages, ensuring the system's continuous improvement. To better identify rare but critical flaws, we design Enhanced Tversky, a composite loss function to mitigate severe class imbalance by explicitly prioritising rare yet safety-critical defects like cracks. Evaluation on 5,525 classified frames and 1,013 segmented images demonstrates F2 score of 87.59% and a mean IoU of 78.73%, with crack detection reaching a crucial 89.62% F2 score. The framework reduces expert review time by 3.88 x whilst maintaining safety standards, offering a practical approach to scaling offshore inspection capabilities through Human-AI collaboration."

    "abstract": "This work addresses the challenge of dynamic elements in monocular visual odometry, which traditionally relies on keypoint matching under the assumption of a fully static scene. In real-world environments, however, moving objects violate this assumption and can degrade pose estimation accuracy. To miti-gate this, we propose enhancing a classical feature-based visual odometry pipeline by using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) neural network to detect potentially dynamic objects and remove keypoints located within their bounding boxes. We compare this approach to a baseline method that uses only geometric keypoint matching, using sequences from the KITTI dataset for evaluation. Quantitative evaluation shows an improvement in the accuracy of the estimated trajectory when keypoints on dynamic objects are excluded from the odometry process."

Firstly, the basic principles of evidence theory were elucidated. Secondly, an improved method based on similarity coefficient is introduced to address the issue of evidence conflicts. By calculating the similarity between evidence bodies to measure their mutual support, the original basic probability allocation function is modified accordingly, effectively reducing the adverse impact of conflicting evidence on the synthesis results. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through simulation testing. Finally, by combining specific examples for application verification, the results show that the improved model can scientifically and accurately integrate multi-source uncertainty information, achieve reasonable evaluation of equipment health status, and is superior to traditional methods, providing reference for equipment health management."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "One of the most important artifacts of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) are metamodels. Like other software artifacts, they are expected to evolve. Consequently, their models thus become invalid and need to be fixed. The usual strategy is to adapt those models based on changes made to the metamodel, i.e., co-evolution. Co-evolution, however, depends on correctly recorded changes since even small deviations can impact the models that will be evolved. One problem is that those changes are usually not preserved or complete. The reason is that the most common way to record the history of metamodels is by using text-based version control systems, i.e., Git. This, however, hinders the detection of the concrete changes made to the metamodel, which are used for co-evolution. This aspect leads to problems in maintaining and evolving metamodels and their models in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that allows engineers to reconstruct the history of metamodels with the help of ChangeTrees. These ChangeTrees recommend possible sequences of changes between two metamodel versions, i.e., evolved metamodels. We conducted an empirical study that detected changes to eight different metamodels across varying domains. The results show that our approach can correctly reconstruct the metamodel's history by detecting all possible changes between the two versions. Furthermore, performance results show that, in the worst case, our approach required 15.65 seconds to detect and generate a ChangeTree of a metamodel with more than 351 changes applied to it (between two versions), leading to 11,268 branching change paths (alternative sequences of changes)."

This paper presents an experimental study of fine-tuning 27 LMs for a multiclass classification task to identify depression severity using 40,191 tweets labeled by human annotators. We fine-tune 14 Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), 6 Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approaches (RoBerta), 3 Generative Pretraining (GPT), and 4 Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) based LMs to classify confidential and anonymized tweets. We report that T5, through conditional generation, outperforms widely adopted BERT, RoBerta, and GPT types for classifying confidential and anonymized tweets. Anonymizing personal information safeguards user privacy and often increases LM performance. Case sensitivity can potentially improve or harm the performance of domain-specific LMs for original and anonymized text."

    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) datasets come in various schemas and can contain a range of data types, measurement units, and variables that share duplicate semantic content. The process of bringing such datasets into a common schema with consistent values, so that it is possible to perform queries uniformly, is known as harmonization. However, performing this process manually can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. In this work, we present a web-based platform that semi-automates the harmonization and linking of EHR datasets through a human-in-the-loop framework, guiding users with the use of large language models (LLMs). Our solution is a two-stage harmonization pipeline that keeps schema metadata processing online while handling patient-level data locally, to align with HIPAA data privacy principles. In the first stage, users harmonize and link only non-identifiable schema information. In the second stage, sensitive value-level harmonization occurs entirely on the user's system, so no private and protected health information ever leaves their environment. Throughout both stages, we expect that LLM-powered suggestions could potentially speed up the harmonization and linking processes."

    "abstract": "Water is crucial resource for life, and evaluating its quality is essential to ensure it is safe for consumption. Recently, water quality is declining due to human activities often referred to as the \"universal solvent,\" water can dissolve more substances than any other liquid, making it highly susceptible to contamination. With advancements in machine learning (ML), A number of quality factors may be used to streamline process of predicting whether water is drinkable. Our study examines uses of several ML modules with hyper tune parameters, including Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests, XGBoost, (QDA), a hybrid model that uses stacking with Random Forest as the base model, XGBoost as the meta-model, and a soft voting model that combines Random Forest and XGBoost. Work uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique), which improves model training and accuracy in classification by creating synthetic samples for minority class, to tackle problem of class imbalance. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) improves a model's efficiency and interpretability by maximizing class separation and reducing dimensionality. Feature ranking was done by analyzing LDA weights, and models were trained with varying numbers of top-ranked features to reduce training time. Results were compared to those from models using all features. This study utilized a dataset adapted from Kaggle to develop an efficient and accurate system for real-time water quality monitoring. Outcomes portray as machine learning (ML) models could efficiently forecast water potability, serving as an invaluable tool for resource management and ensuring public health in areas with limited access to conventional water testing infrastructure."

Early prediction and prevention of health risks are essential for reducing complications and improving outcomes. This research introduces a stacking ensemble model for maternal health risk prediction, combining the strengths of Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting with XGBoost as the meta-model. The ensemble approach enhances accuracy and reliability, achieving a classification accuracy of 91.13%, with precision, recall, and f1-scores exceeding 85% across all risk categories.Beyond accurate prediction, this study emphasizes model interpretability through Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), an Explainable AI (XAI) method that provides actionable insights for risk reduction. Counterfactual analysis identifies the minimal changes needed in the patient features to shift a high- or medium-risk classification to low-risk, offering clinically relevant recommendations. These counterfactuals are generated to ensure feasibility, preserving physiological plausibility and practical applicability for healthcare professionals. This work bridges the gap between black-box machine learning models and actionable decision-making by integrating predictive power with explainability, supporting more transparent and patient-centric maternal health interventions."

    "abstract": "Malware remains a persistent and evolving cyber-security threat. Conventional detection methodologies rooted in static binary analysis or dynamic tracing of API calls suffer from critical limitations. The former is readily circumvented through code obfuscation, while the latter demands substantial computational resources and is often infeasible at enterprise scale. This work investigates an alternative approach to malware classification that forgoes both direct binary analysis and fine-grained instrumentation, instead utilizing high-level system telemetry such as process, file, registry, and network events. Such telemetry is routinely generated by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems and retained in centralized security logging platforms (e.g., SIEMs), rendering this method applicable to enterprise environments. Treating sequences of telemetry events as text-like data, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to model behavioral patterns and evaluate four neural architectures: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a Transformer-based model on the task of malware family classification. Our results show that telemetry-only data enables accurate classification, with the Transformer model achieving peak performance ( 95–96% accuracy) and the remaining models following closely. This study contributes (1) empirical evidence that high-level behavioral telemetry is sufficient for malware classification on real-world samples, (2) a novel application of NLP-based sequence modeling to malware behavior data, and (3) a comparative analysis of modern neural architectures, highlighting trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and deployability. The findings underscore the potential of leveraging existing enterprise telemetry for scalable, real-time malware detection. Code for this project is available at: https://github.com/schladt/GIMC/."

    "abstract": "The relationship between cafes and house prices is an emerging field of study in urban data analytics. Recent research suggests that homes near cafes, especially premium cafes, start out dearer and appreciate faster than the broader U.S. housing market. However, significant endogeneity due to omitted variables and the possibility of bidirectional causality has made interpretation problematic. This uncertainty is compounded by limited methodical transparency, inadequate falsification criteria, and absence of rigorous analysis of bidirectional causation in the published work on this topic. Our study aims to fill these gaps. We present an analytical framework based on a Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) event-study regression model (i.e., a generalized difference-in-differences design for staggered entry) combined with matching and covariate adjustment, to simultaneously study forward and reverse causality between house prices and premium café entry. Using Starbucks as a case study, we performed robust empirical analysis of the association between Starbucks' entry, and pre- and post-entry house price growth in over 500 U.S. neighborhoods across 45 states from 2012 to 2022. We controlled for nationwide price trends and shocks, neighborhood affluence, and short- and long-term price momentum. Our study included a placebo arm populated with “fake” Starbucks stores opened in random years to test whether pre- or post-entry price growth was driven solely by non-Starbucks related covariates. We found that while neighborhood characteristics and historical price momentum dominated, significant bidirectional effects consistent with causal influence between Starbucks' entry and house prices were also observed under stated assumptions. Placebo results falsified the hypothesis that the observed bidirectional effects were driven purely by non-Starbucks covariates. Our findings contribute real-world insights on urban amenity-price dynamics and offer a generalizable template for such empirical studies with strong policy and market relevance."

    "abstract": "Hip osteoarthritis, or coxarthrosis, is a degenerative disease that disrupts the balance between the formation and degradation of articular cartilage and subchondral bone, causing structural damage, progressive pain, and functional impairment. Its estimated prevalence is 12%, occurring at least twice as often in women as in men. Clinical and radiological evidence shows that approximately 6% of people over 30 years of age and 10% of those over 65 years of age present with symptoms of coxarthrosis. Total hip arthroplasty is the most effective treatment for improving the patient's quality of life, although it carries risks such as an increased likelihood of femoral neck fracture. This study proposes a Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of a femur model corresponding to an individual under 65 years of age, weighing 90 kg and measuring 175 cm, presenting a normal coxa acetabular morphology with a surface prosthesis, in which its biomechanical performance is evaluated under four scenarios: a static condition (standing) and three dynamic conditions (vertical jump with single-leg landing). Anatomical and biomechanical data were collected, and SolidWorks software was used for modeling and stress analysis. The results showed maximum stresses in biomechanically coherent areas, all below the elastic limits of cortical bone and Ti-6Al-4V; This is consistent with other studies indicating that hip resurfacing arthroplasty is a viable and effective long-term solution for appropriately selected active male patients."

    "abstract": "Sound plays a fundamental role in gameplay: it informs, illustrates, feedbacks, and gives substance to the virtual world. These functions operate across different temporalities of gameplay, which take the form of nested loops that structure the player’s experience. While existing analytical frameworks help organize the soundscape effectively, they do not explicitly address the temporal dimensions of gameplay loops. Our objective is to advance the understanding of sound’s role in gameplay and to better describe its complexity, in order to provide new tools for collaboration between game designers and sound designers. We propose a theoretical framework for a new four-dimensional analysis grid that considers gameplay, signs and feedback, perception, and technical aspects. We apply this framework to the video game Fortnite (Epic Games) to demonstrate the relevance and potential of our approach."

    "abstract": "The liquid state machine (LSM), a reservoir computing variant of spiking neural networks (SNNs), has been widely adopted for its low training complexity. In this work, we propose C2-LSM, a neuromorphic processor designed through algorithm–hardware co-design to achieve high accuracy across diverse tasks. At the algorithm level, inspired by the “small-world” structure of the biological brain, we introduce a novel reservoir layer in which neurons are interconnected using a cubecluster topology. For hardware implementation, the customized C2-LSM processor supports runtime configurability of reservoir size and connection sparsity, enabling high classification accuracy across a range of spatiotemporal tasks. Additionally, a Network-on-Chip (NoC) with a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Storm</i> routing algorithm is developed to improve the spike event transmission throughput among reservoir neurons. C2-LSM is implemented on an AMD Virtex UltraScale+ VCU129 FPGA running at 250 MHz. With on-chip learning, it achieves accuracies of 98.02%, 94.26%, and 93.00% on MNIST, N-MNIST, and FSDD datasets, respectively, outperforming recently benchmarked LSM neuromorphic processors across all three tasks. For the MNIST task, it achieves an inference speed of 1155 FPS and a learning speed of 1154 FPS, along with a high power efficiency of 103 GSOPS/W."

    "abstract": "Body channel powering (BCP) has emerged as a promising method for wirelessly powering the Internet of Implanted Things (IoIT). However, current galvanic-coupling (GC-BCP) and capacitive-coupling (CC-BCP) techniques are limited by short transmission distance and restricted applicability to fully implantable devices, respectively. To address these issues, this paper proposes a tissue-coupling BCP (TC-BCP) technique that employs a floated transmitter (TX) ground electrode to enhance coupling with remote implant-site tissue, thereby enabling more power delivery to the fully implanted receiver (RX). A lumped circuit model is first developed to theoretically analyze three fundamental transmission properties. Experimental validation using a prototype system demonstrates that TC-BCP outperforms conventional BCP in long-range power transfer achieving 8.63 dB higher path gain at a lateral distance of 24 cm, and expands single RX to at least three simultaneous RX nodes with minimal interference. Moreover, the optimization of stacked-up TX electrode configuration, considering three key geometric parameters, yields a path gain enhancement of up to 7.58 dB. These investigations confirm that the proposed TC-BCP can effectively extend the transmission range while supporting multi-node and integrated-TX powering of fully implantable IoIT."

A hybrid physics-based and data-driven (HPD) approach is proposed to construct the performance objective functions of a many-objective optimization (MaOO) problem, where the power oscillations are theoretically derived, and an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to model the relationships between the decision variables and current-related metrics (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathit {THD}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathit {UI}$</tex-math></inline-formula>). A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is employed to solve the MaOO problem, yielding a set of optimal decision variables. A subsequent post-optimization selection then identifies feasible solutions that prioritize one performance metric while keeping the others within acceptable limits, thereby avoiding undesirable trade-offs and resulting in three optimized CRGs. Experimental validation demonstrates that the optimized CRGs achieved through the proposed MaO-OCRGS effectively enhance one performance objective without unacceptable degradation in others, as the other metrics are maintained within their predefined limits, thus offering flexibility while enhancing the overall LVRT performance under unbalanced voltage conditions."

    "abstract": "Robots in uncertain realworld environments must perform both goaldirected and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions."

Traditional transit-time measurement methods, such as cross-correlation and threshold detection, are widely employed. Among these, the threshold method exhibits advantages in simplicity and real-time performance. However, under the impact of circuit or pipeline noise, echo signals often undergo distortion, significantly degrading the accuracy of transit-time measurements. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel frequency-doubling measurement technique based on the principles of threshold detection, aiming to shorten the time interval during which the comparator output is affected by random noise and improve the precision and consistency of transit-time measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with conventional methods, the proposed approach reduces the mean standard deviation of transit-time measurements by 28.73% under actual operating conditions. The final relative error of flow measurement is constrained within ±2%, with its repeatability better than ±0.2%, and its overall performance is superior to that of traditional methods. This research offers a new direction for optimizing measurement techniques in ultrasonic gas flowmeters, boasting significant theoretical value, substantial engineering application potential, and low cost."

The establishment of an analytical model for the SLMBA’s nonlinear behavior forms the basis for the design, which enables precise coordination of multisection gain profiles. Simultaneously, an SLMBA architecture featuring tailored adaptive biasing of driver amplifiers (DAs) is proposed to enhance linearity by dynamically enlarging the current conduction angle (CCA), strategically configuring DAs expansion to compensate for carrier power amplifier (PA) compression and peaking PA expansion deficits, effectively achieving minimal gain deviation characteristics over the entire power range. For validation, an SLMBA operating at 2.5–2.7 GHz was implemented in a gallium arsenide heterojunction bipolar transistor (GaAs HBT) process. Measurements under continuous-wave (CW) excitation demonstrate a saturated output power of 36.3–37.0 dBm with 38.9%–39.2% power-added efficiency (PAE) and PAE of 29.0%–30.7% at 7-dB output back-off. Significantly, measurements confirm ±1-dB gain variation at 2.6 GHz. When driven by a 60-MHz 256-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal with a 10.6-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the SLMBA achieves an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) better than −38.58 dBc and an error-vector magnitude (EVM) of 1.58% without digital predistortion (DPD)."

    "abstract": "Abstract-Connected scatterplots visualize time-series data by connecting the points on a scatterplot based on temporal sequence. Viewers are prone to misinterpret the direction of time in these visualizations, possibly because they encode time with an unexpected rule - along the connected line (TIME IS A LINE) instead of from left to right (RIGHT IS LATER) as conventional in line charts. In this paper, we use the connected scatterplot to illustrate a perspective on visualization comprehension centered around expectations of encoding rules. People have initial expectations of encoding rules for visualizations that can stem from conventional practices or metaphors, and these expectations have been recognized as a potential factor influencing visualization comprehension. We present three preregistered experiments (n = 1429 in total) demonstrating two kinds of design interventions to strengthen the correct expectation for time and testing their effectiveness in reducing errors for understanding realistic connected scatterplots. We found that visual treatments that suppress the incorrect chart-type expectation and directional cues that emphasize the correct expectation both led viewers to expect TIME IS A LINE more. An explicit directional cue (arrows), ideally redundantly encoded with another cue (trace-line effect or animation), was most effective for reducing misinterpretations. Our findings not only provide practical guidelines for designing connected scatterplots but also contribute theoretical insights to inform the design of novel visualizations that challenge interpretability by defying expectations."

    "abstract": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) plays a crucial role in the early screening of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent advances in vision Transformers (ViTs) demonstrate strong potential for sMRI-based computer-aided diagnosis by capturing long-range dependencies. However, their high computational demands and opaque decision-making hinder clinical application. To address these challenges, we explore the inherent structural redundancy in brain sMRI and propose an efficient and interpretable slice-patch selection Transformer (SPSFormer) framework that selectively focuses on task-relevant sMRI slices and patches, significantly reducing the computational overhead of existing ViTs. Specifically, SPSFormer employs lightweight learnable scorers placed before and within the ViT recognizer to estimate the importance of slice and patch candidates. Subsequently, a perturbed-maximum based differentiable Top-k operator is constructed to select the top-scoring elements for end-to-end training. We conduct rigorous cross-dataset validation (NACC, ADNI, AIBL) to evaluate generalizability. Across DeiT and Swin recognizers, SPSFormer reduces required GFLOPs by approximately <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2-4\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Analysis of learned selection policies highlights key regions (e.g., hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, thalamus) consistent with established AD neuropathology, supporting interpretability. The model's predicted AD probability shows significant associations with cognitive and biomarker measures, confirming neurobiological validity, and offers prognostic value: higher predicted AD probability is associated with shorter time to conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. These findings suggest that coupling high computational efficiency with intrinsic explainability offers a promising direction to clinically deployable, trustworthy artificial intelligence for AD detection."

For comparison, a narrow-band canonical fundamental-mode patch antenna allows only 0.11 W under the same conditions for touch compliance. The wide bandwidth of the proposed antenna is achieved by combining three even modes excited at close frequencies. The use of even modes results in split SAR maxima and thus lower SAR levels compared to odd modes to achieve touch compliance. To further prove the applicability of the antenna, its performance is evaluated using power-dependent multiplexing efficiency based on indoor channel models. The proposed design demonstrates superior performance, e.g., 4.9–6.0 times higher median levels of the power-dependent multiplexing efficiency in various scenarios, over the canonical patch antenna."

Considering common misalignment conditions, a receiver-side control strategy without dual-side communication is also designed for minimum fault current ratios and power sharing between the two subtopologies under normal operation, and a system design method for constant power output is then given. A WPT prototype with the proposed hybrid topology is developed, and the experimental validation is performed. The results show that the steady-state fault current is about two times the normal value under various faults, and the system can even operate with an abnormal close coupling or OC fault at the transmitting coil branch in the LCC/S subtopology."

The dog skin disease image-based datasets are categorized into four types: Fungal Infections, Bacterial Dermatosis, Hypersensitivity (allergic dermatosis), and Healthy Skin. Using Transfer Learning approaches, pre-trained deep learning models such as MobileNetV2, EfficientB0, EfficientB3, DenseNet121, and VGG19 were optimized to enhance model performance. With the highest validation accuracy of 76.40%, DenseNet121 was achieved as compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for electrical energy driven by global consumption, such as China's 600 TWh in 2023 has reinforced the importance of clean and sustainable sources. The performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems is significantly influenced by panel manufacturing technologies and external environmental conditions, including dust, water droplets, animal waste, and especially partial shading, which can reduce power output. This paper proposes a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), aimed at enhancing the energy extraction efficiency from PV systems under variable and non-stable environmental conditions. A DC-DC boost converter is used to regulate the energy transfer between the PV panel and the load, with its duty cycle dynamically adjusted by the proposed algorithms. The hybrid FL&ANN model is trained using real-world data from different photovoltaic technologies, including HIT, Amorphous Silicon (a-Si), Tandem (a-Si/µc-Si), and Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS). Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink under varying irradiance and temperature scenarios. The results demonstrate that the hybrid FL&ANN controller outperforms original FLC in terms of response time and tracking accuracy. Additionally, this approach proves highly effective in electro mobility applications, where PV panels are continuously exposed to dynamic environmental conditions such as partial shading during vehicle movement. The proposed method offers a viable and efficient solution to optimize solar energy usage in modern, mobility-focused energy systems."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are extremely important for communication and monitoring systems but are usually plagued by ineffective routing methods and limited energy resources. Traditional methods such as full opportunistic routing (OR) and LEACH may result in packet loss, delay in networks, and more energy consumption. A novel data-driven routing paradigm is proposed in this paper that combines predictive next-hop routing with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) and optimal Cluster Head (CH) selection via Bayesian Optimization (BO). For improving the realism and the reliability of models, a real-world WSN dataset is used. While BNN enables smart routing decisions by learning from historical transmission patterns, BO selects CHs dynamically according to node-specific conditions such as energy and base station distance. Furthermore, partial opportunistic routing is employed to reduce broadcast overhead and improve routing efficiency. MATLAB is used to simulate and implement the system, and results indicate that it is more power and communication efficient than current routing protocols."

    "abstract": "The floriculture sector in Ecuador has grown rapidly in recent decades, becoming one of the country's most important economic sectors. This sector generates a high demand for labor, especially in activities that require repetitive movements, physical effort and prolonged postures, such as harvesting and packing roses. These activities have been associated with an increase in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), particularly in the upper extremities. These health problems not only impact workers' quality of life, but also reduce productivity and increase costs associated with absenteeism and medical treatment. Despite the importance of mitigating these risks, real-time ergonomic assessment remains a challenge due to the lack of accessible, accurate and easy-to-implement technologies in the workplace. That is why we implemented technological solutions with smart devices, such as Kinect V2, which helped us to monitor and analyze workers' movements in real time. These tools provided accurate and objective data that supported the identification and prevention of ergonomic risks. The data acquisition system focused on the ergonomic assessment of the upper limbs at relevant points: wrists, shoulder and elbow, during rose harvesting and packing activities. This system used advanced technologies to collect and analyze data automatically, allowing to identify risks and propose corrective measures to optimize working conditions in the floriculture sector."

Traditional vulnerability analysis depends heavily on manual inspection and domain-specific expertise, which are increasingly inadequate in the era of generative AI-driven code development. This research proposes an AI-based automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation framework that leverages multi-modal datasets, including source code and binaries, to achieve end-to- end automation across the vulnerability lifecycle: detection, patch generation, and validation. The system integrates explainable AI (XAI)-based vulnerability cause analysis, generative patch synthesis, system-level defensive code generation, Rust-based memory safety transformation, and differential privacy mechanisms for model confidentiality. Developed through a Korea- U.S. joint research initiative, this project aims to establish an internationally deployable platform for trustworthy and privacy- preserving AI -driven software security. The proposed research contributes both foundational methods and operational tools toward self-healing, explainable, and secure-by-design software ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Driver fatigue and distraction represent major causes of road accidents worldwide, and several sensor-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate these risks. However, despite their advantages, existing methods often struggle to accurately detect and generalize the diverse manifestations of fatigue and distraction in real time. To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel hybrid accident prevention framework for Driver Fatigue and Distraction Detection using the YOLOv10 architecture. The proposed model leverages the backbone, neck, and head components of YOLOv10 to process real-time video streams efficiently. Specifically, the backbone employs a convolutional neural network to extract critical facial features and driver gestures, including hand movements and potentially distracting behaviors such as neck orientation. These features are aggregated in the neck component and subsequently analyzed in the head component for object recognition, bounding box generation, and classification through object scores. The framework demonstrates high efficiency in real-time facial behavior analysis and driver monitoring. Experimental evaluation conducted in a Python environment using benchmark datasets confirms that the proposed model achieves superior detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, attaining 98.2% accuracy. Furthermore, the system exhibits reduced latency, ensuring timely detection and response to potential threats. Overall, the proposed YOLOv10-based framework offers a sophisticated, real-time driver assistance system, enhancing road safety by accurately identifying fatigue and distraction while minimizing delays in threat mitigation."

    "abstract": "The visible light wireless communication technology, known as Li-Fi, is emerging as one of the most promising communication technologies. This technology can transmit data over an often-unused portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Although some studies have highlighted the complementary value of Li-Fi to current wireless technologies, performance testing and compatibility evaluation with industrial protocols are still needed. This study evaluates the performance of commercial Li-Fi devices, comparing them with current technologies such as Gigabit-Ethernet and Wi-Fi 5G. Tests have been designed and implemented to assess the constant connectivity, bandwidth, latency, and transmission and reception speeds using network protocols such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and compatibility with industrial protocols such as Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE). The study found that Li-Fi and Wi-Fi have speed and transfer time limitations compared to Ethernet. Additionally, one of the Li-Fi technologies studied outperforms Wi-Fi technology in transmission speed and stability, but presents challenges related to signal availability and limited compatibility with industrial protocols, including long transfer and reconnection times. Although Li-Fi can complement existing wireless technologies, significant challenges must be solved before adopting industrial automation systems."

    "abstract": "Compliant mechanisms are designed to deform in a controlled manner in response to external forces, using the flexibility of their components to store potential elastic energy during deformation, gradually releasing it upon returning to their original form. This article examines a knee orthosis designed to assist users during the stand-up motion, utilizing a compliant mechanism to balance the user's weight and minimize strain on leg muscles during this motion. The design process for the semi-rigid knee orthosis involved selecting materials and developing a numerical model for the compliant mechanism, which is represented as a spring. Geometric properties are obtained through the numerical modeling of the spring once the desired stiffness and safety factor values have been reached. Subsequently, a 3D finite element analysis was conducted. The study reveals a strong correlation between the maximum stress in the mathematical model (250.22 MPa) and the simulation (239.8 MPa), with an error of 4.16%. Both analyses of safety factors yielded results of 1.02 for the mathematical approach and 1.1 for the simulation, with a consistent margin of error of 7.84%. The spring's stiffness exhibits a 5.62% difference when analytically calculated at 90.82 Nm/rad and 85.71 Nm/rad in the simulation. These results suggest significant potential for the proposed device in helping patients with knee orthopedic restrictions, contributing to ongoing efforts in advancing the understanding and treatment of knee osteoarthritis."

    "abstract": "Addressing student attrition in higher education requires predictive models that are not only accurate but also generalizable across diverse institutional contexts. This study confronts the crisis of external validity in educational data mining by developing and rigorously validating a machine learning framework for predicting undergraduate dropout. Using a public dataset of 4,424 students from a Portuguese university as our primary source, we employ Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models, optimized with Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV), to identify the most salient predictors of dropout. Our analysis identifies a parsimonious set of nine key features, with “curricular units passed in the first semester” and “tuition fee status” emerging as the most powerful predictors. The resulting Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 and an AUC of 0.86 on the primary dataset. The core contribution of this research lies in its multi-source validation strategy. We tested the trained model's predictive power on an external dataset from Tecnologico de' Monterrey, Mexico, where it maintained a high accuracy of 0.88, demonstrating exceptional generalizability. Furthermore, we corroborated the identified risk factors against national-level statistics from Peru's Superintendencia Nacional de Educación Superior Universitaria (SUNEDU), confirming their contextual relevance. This research provides a robust, validated model for student retention and, more importantly, offers a methodological blueprint for developing and validating generalizable predictive tools to support evidence-based interventions in higher education systems globally."

It offers detailed anatomical information that aids in detecting and analysing a wide range of diseases. The rich structural insights provided by MRI scans play a vital role in clinical decision-making, enabling healthcare professionals to interpret and assess underlying medical conditions accurately. The gap that arises between high-level and low-level data acquisition. Advanced image segmentation algorithms are essential to convert low-level MRI data into meaningful clinical insights. Preprocessing techniques are typically applied to reduce noise and enhance image quality, facilitating more accurate segmentation and analysis. However, an existing deep joint segmentation can segment the static stroke lesion regions. It is required to focus on dynamic feature learning and segmenting regions. So, a novel Content-Adaptive Joint Segmentation (CAJS) is proposed. This method will represent global features and fusion of attentive weights, which leads to dynamic and effective segmentation. The extracted insights effectively support reliable and clinically relevant classification. The Xception network model has been used for stroke detection. Experimental validation of the proposed method is conducted on the ISLES 2022 dataset. The developed CAJS model is designed by integrating dynamic global features with Deep Joint segmentation and Xception Network algorithm, with the highest specificity of 93%, accuracy of 93%, and sensitivity of 93.2%."

    "abstract": "As cyberattacks continue to evolve in frequency, scope, and sophistication, the demand for robust, layered security systems has never been greater. Enterprises and institutions are increasingly adopting multifaceted strategies to address the weaknesses of traditional point-based security solutions. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of three powerful tools-Suricata, Wazuh, and Splunk, each of which contributes uniquely to a unified real-time threat detection and response architecture. Suricata is used for network-based intrusion detection and monitoring, Wazuh handles host-level security with agent-based analytics, and Splunk serves as a centralized SIEM platform for log aggregation and threat intelligence. By integrating these tools, organizations can achieve visibility, adaptability, and automation across the entire security landscape. This approach aligns with current best practices for layered defense and zero-trust architectures, offering a flexible model that scales from small businesses to large enterprises. We explore each tool in detail, including how they work, how to use them, and their practical advantages when used individually and together."

    "abstract": "An enhanced reference particle swarm optimization (RPSO) acoustic localization algorithm with fiber-optic Fabry-Pérot self-calibration multiplexing demodulation system is proposed. The system employs self-calibrating wavelength modulation technology to achieve stable simultaneous demodulation and high-precision time delay measurement for sensors with different cavity lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) above 45 dB of the 40-95 kHz frequency range in 4-channel multiplexing scenarios, providing reliable time difference of arrival (TDOA) information for sound source localization (SSL). Building upon this foundation, the proposed RPSO algorithm introduces a reference set mechanism and dynamic inertia weight strategy, effectively addressing the slow convergence and low positioning accuracy of conventional algorithms in complex environments. SSL experiments demonstrate that under identical test conditions, the RPSO algorithm consistently maintains localization errors within 1 cm while reducing required iterations by 80% compared to the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, significantly improving the real-time performance and accuracy of the localization system."

    "abstract": "Estimating the clutter-plus-noise covariance matrix in high-dimensional (stap) is challenging in the presence of Internal Clutter Motion (ICM) and a high noise floor. The problem becomes more difficult in low-sample regimes, where the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) becomes ill-conditioned. To capture the ICM and high noise floor, we model the covariance matrix using a “Banded+Spiked” structure. Since the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for this model is non-convex, we propose a convex relaxation which is formulated as a Frobenius norm minimization with non-smooth convex constraints enforcing banded sparsity. This relaxation serves as a provable upper bound for the non-convex likelihood maximization and extends to cases where the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples. We derive a variational inequality-based bound to assess its quality. We introduce an algorithm to jointly estimate the banded clutter covariance and noise power. Additionally, we establish conditions ensuring the estimated covariance matrix remains positive definite and the bandsize is accurately recovered. Numerical results using the high-fidelity RFView radar simulation environment demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher Signal–to–Clutter–plus–Noise Ratio (SCNR) than state–of–the–art methods, including TABASCO, Spiked Covariance Stein Shrinkage, and Diagonal Loading, particularly when the covariance matrix dimension exceeds the number of samples."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demand substantial computational resources, resulting in high energy consumption on GPUs. To address this challenge, we focus on Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) as an effective alternative that provides a trade-off between energy efficiency and programmability. This paper presents the first comprehensive, end-to-end evaluation of a non-AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerator for the state-of-the-art Qwen LLM family. The architecture has a general-purpose, task-agnostic design, yet its flexible instruction set allows for domain-specific adaptations. This flexibility enables the architecture to achieve high efficiency for sustainable LLM inference. We assess the performance of our architecture on an FPGA prototype using the widely adopted llama.cpp framework. We then project its potential as a 28nm ASIC and compare it against a high-performance GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4090) and an edge AI device (NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin). While GPUs exhibit lower latency, our non-AI-specific accelerator achieves higher energy efficiency, improving the Power-Delay Product (PDP) by up to 44.4× and 13.6× compared with the RTX 4090 and Jetson, respectively. Similarly, it reduces the Energy-Delay Product (EDP) by up to 11.5× compared to the high-performance GPU, demonstrating a favorable performance-energy trade-off. Critically, our system-level analysis identifies host-accelerator data transfer as the primary performance bottleneck, a factor often overlooked in kernel-level studies. These findings provide design guidance for next-generation LLM accelerators. This work validates CGRAs as a suitable platform for LLM inference in power-constrained environments, without being confined to specific algorithms."

    "abstract": "In large-scene synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, the selection of appropriate algorithms is crucial as it directly impacts processing efficiency and image fidelity. The Polar Format Algorithm (PFA) is widely used for its high-speed image formation capabilities. However, its reliance on the planar wavefront approximation inevitably introduces phase errors. A primary challenge arising from linear components of these errors is geometric distortion, which manifests as space-variant shift from actual positions. Traditional inverse warping correction method based on two-dimensional(2-D) interpolation suffers from high computational costs. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a separable 2-D interpolation framework that decouples the correction process into two one-dimensional (1-D) interpolations along azimuth and range axes. Through inverse solutions of geometric distortion functions, it is demonstrated that applying this framework to geometric distortion correction can effectively reduce the complexity while preserving image precision. Simulations and real-data comparisons validate that the proposed fast geometric distortion correction method significantly improve correction speed thus boosting overall computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Accurate rotational motion compensation is critical for achieving well-focused inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging of maneuvering targets. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and incomplete echoes often lead to significant performance degradation in conventional methods. Furthermore, these methods rely heavily on manual parameter tuning, which limits their adaptability to varying SNR and data missing rate in practical applications. In this article, a novel deep unrolling network for ISAR imaging of maneuvering targets is proposed. Firstly, an iterative method, termed RMC-PDHG, is proposed for rotational motion compensation and well-focused ISAR imaging based on Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG), enabling accurate imaging of maneuvering targets under low SNR and incomplete echo conditions. On this basis, a rotational motion compensation and imaging network, i.e., RMC-PDHG-Net, is developed by unrolling the RMC-PDHG. This network incorporates a hypernetwork to dynamically generate optimal internal parameters such as the regularization coefficient and step size based on intermediate image features, thereby gaining robustness to varying SNR and data missing rate. Additionally, a two-stage training strategy combining unsupervised and supervised learning is proposed to improve rotation parameter estimation accuracy and image reconstruction quality. Experimental results on simulated and measured data have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed network."

Traditional fingerprint extraction methods primarily focus on statistical approaches and end-to-end feature extractors. However, both the methods themselves and the extracted fingerprints often lack interpretability. This article presents a gas fingerprint extraction method based on parameter fitting of the response curve. It involves extracting fitting parameters from the response curves and selecting features according to their information entropy contribution, thereby obtaining highly compact and interpretable gas fingerprints. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed approach enables the identification of gas fingerprints with clear boundaries in class distribution, characterized by smaller intraclass variance and greater interclass distances. The effective fingerprints significantly enhance identification accuracy in species classification and concentration regression. Furthermore, this method incurs lower computational and development costs, does not require a large sample size, and is suitable for both large and small sample sets. This approach offers a cost-effective solution for dimensionality reduction of gas sensor response data, fingerprint extraction, sensor calibration, gas identification, and lightweight model construction."

To address these limitations, we propose GSEMA (Gene Set Enrichment Meta-Analysis), a novel methodology that leverages single-sample enrichment scoring to aggregate gene expression data into pathway-level matrices. By applying meta-analysis techniques to enrichment scores, GSEMA preserves the magnitude and directionality of effects, enabling the definition of pathway activity across datasets. Using simulated data and case studies on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), we demonstrate that GSEMA outperforms other methods in controlling false positive rates while providing meaningful biological interpretations. GSEMA methodology is implemented as an R package available on CRAN repository."

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a key enabler for future wireless networks, particularly in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted systems. However, mmWave frequencies suffer from significant propagation loss and coverage limitations, especially in hybrid indoor-outdoor environments in addition to the rising secrecy issues. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multi-hop secure communication scheme for UAV mmWave networks, where both simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RISs and traditional RISs are deployed to enhance signal coverage and improve system performance. First, we formulate secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem. Next, we develop a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and differential privacy (DP)-enhanced soft actor-critic (GAIDP-SAC) framework to jointly optimize precoding at the UAV, the phase shift profiles of hybrid RISs, and the UAV trajectory. The integration of differential privacy ensures secure communication and privacy preservation, while GAI accelerates convergence and improves policy learning efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GAIDP-SAC framework significantly enhances the coverage and security of UAV mmWave networks in hybrid indoor-outdoor environments. Furthermore, the results show that our method effectively handles the complex joint optimization problem, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-hop RIS-assisted UAV mmWave communication systems."

This paper introduces the Feedback-Aided Coding and Energy Transfer (FACET) framework, which synergistically combines adaptive feedback channel coding with wireless power transfer. FACET leverages the saturation effect of feedback coding, where increasing downlink power yields diminishing returns, to design a dual-purpose feedback mechanism that simultaneously guides uplink coding and replenishes device energy. We characterize the inherent tradeoff between feedback precision and harvested power, and formulate a fairness-constrained min-max optimization problem to minimize worst-case net energy consumption. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and Lagrangian duality is developed, with each subproblem admitting a closed-form solution. Simulations show that FACET nearly triples device lifetime compared to conventional feedback coding architectures, and remains robust across a wide range of power regimes. These results suggest that FACET not only improves communication efficiency but also redefines the role of feedback in energy-constrained IoT systems."

Current deep learning-based SEI approaches rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets; however, the high cost and expertise required for annotation limit their practical application. To address these challenges, we propose SSAL-SEI, a radiation source identification method that integrates active learning with semi-supervised learning. During the active learning phase, a balanced sampling strategy that considers both uncertainty and diversity is employed to dynamically select the most informative unlabeled samples while maintaining class distribution equilibrium for annotation. In the subsequent semi-supervised phase, unlabeled data are further leveraged to enhance feature representation capabilities. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) dataset with 10, 20, and 30 classes, as well as on a Wi-Fi dataset comprising 16 classes, in conjunction with multiple SOTA models. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy not only significantly improves the performance of semi-supervised learning but also provides effective guidance for optimizing SEI techniques under limited labeling conditions."

The proposed integrated approach overcomes limitations of single-sensor methodologies by combining structural, biochemical, and physiological data streams to create a holistic monitoring framework. Two detailed case studies from large-scale commercial orchid producers in Taiwan and India demonstrate implementation efficacy, showcasing 28% reduction in water usage, 17% decrease in fertilizer application, and 22% increase in marketable yield through sensor-guided interventions. Economic analyses reveal a return on investment period of 14-18 months for medium-sized operations (>5,000 plants) with technology adoption costs offset by production efficiency gains. Technical challenges including sensor calibration drift (-0.8%/month), integration complexity, and scalability considerations are addressed with proposed solutions for commercial implementation.

The post-surgical retention of gauze can lead to serious complications in the patient's health and necessitate additional surgery for gauze removal. In the wake of data scarcity, the research on gauze segmentation on the real-world surgical data remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the use of deep learning methods for gauze segmentation in robotassisted minimally invasive abdominal surgeries, utilizing an inhouse surgical dataset prepared at a university hospital. The training data reflects a realistic surgical setting and extensive diversity in spatial, morphological, and visual attributes of three different gauze categories. We have investigated prevalently used segmentation architectures, including CNN-based, transformer-based, and hybrid architectures, to provide a proof-of-concept for gauze segmentation in a realistic setting. Besides, we investigate the influence of additional sub-optimally annotated, auto-tracked segmentation masks to address the bottleneck of data scarcity and performance optimization. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of real-world data to counter the main challenge reported by prior works - the trade-off between blood presence and gauze detection. The incorporation of auto-track annotations enables performance enhancements, particularly in generic cases. The integration of effective segmentation approaches will benefit robotguided surgical procedures and various downstream applications by providing a precise delineation of foreign objects, enhancing patient safety and surgical outcomes."

    "abstract": "When green energy sources are added to modern power lines, they need improved energy storage options to deal with intermittent power, changing demand, and goals for sustainability. This study compares lithium-ion, flow batteries, compressed air energy storage (CAES), along with hydrogen systems. It looks at how well they work in terms of cost, lifespan, and CO2 emissions, as well as how well they work in terms of technology. The study looks at how well systems work when seasonal loads change and green inputs change. It does this by using computer models made with MATLAB/Simulink as well as HOMER Pro and checking them against real-world data. A multi-objective optimisation method finds the Pareto-optimal designs that balance cost, speed, and effect on the environment. The results help us figure out how to make energy storage systems that are strong, affordable, and long-lasting, which is very important for a renewable-powered grid that works well."

    "abstract": "Reliable anomaly detection under data contamination remains a major challenge in Prognostics and Health Management, especially when degradation processes are gradual and clean training data are unavailable. This paper introduces a weighted iterative refinement framework with autoencoders for contaminated anomaly detection (WIRACAD) to address this problem. The method, which is based on reconstruction residuals, re-weights training samples across iterations in order to progressively reduce the influence of suspected anomalies. This continuous refinement improves the robustness of health indicator learning from contaminated time series. The proposed approach is evaluated on two public benchmarks: the NASA C-MAPSS dataset and the IMS Bearing dataset. Results show consistent improvements in key metrics related to degradation monitoring. In particular, the overal fit score and the monotonicty are improved when compared to baseline autoencoder training and recent refinement-based methods. These findings suggest that iterative sample weighting can enhance unsupervised anomaly detection with autoencoders in settings where data contamination is assumed."

Although international standards such as ISO/IEC 40500 (WCAG 2.0) provide general accessibility guidelines, many VLEs remain inadequate in addressing the specific cognitive and perceptual needs of neurodivergent users. This study presents an ISObased methodology for evaluating VLE accessibility, integrating ISO/IEC 40500, ISO/IEC 25012, and ISO/IEC 25024 standards. The methodology comprises three phases: (1) a bibliometric analysis to identify research trends and gaps in digital accessibility; (2) the design and validation of specialized accessibility indicators through expert review and user testing with individuals with Asperger syndrome; and (3) the development of ISO-compliant accessibility metrics for objective and quantifiable evaluation. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model offers a structured, replicable, and user-centered framework for assessing and enhancing accessibility in VLEs. By aligning with established standards and incorporating direct user input, the model contributes to the advancement of inclusive digital education practices."

As the number of patients increased at an exponential rate, the already-stressed healthcare industry encountered new problems.

This paper aims to grow a new system that uses the most effective machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict a patient's disease based on their signs, recordings of audio, available medical records, and other health histories. The goal is to address the urgent need for more \"remote\" discussions in the \"post-COVID\" era, and the Internet of Things (IoT) shows great promise in this regard. Sensors that are based on Arduino and ESP8266 may also be used to measure some of the indications, like fever and low oxygen levels in the blood, among others. It then offers for the suitable treatment and diagnosis of the condition based on its database, which is continually updated and may be designed as a platform that is either based on an application or a website."

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is widely regarded as a leading defense strategy for improving the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. However, existing AT methods often rely on a single attack strategy during training, which limits the exploration of the perturbation space and leads to poor generalization robustness against stronger, unseen, or adaptive adversarial attacks. Moreover, most AT approaches overlook class-wise robustness–the observed variation in robustness across different image classes–by focusing solely on average performance over the entire dataset. In this paper, we present Advanced Distributional Training with Class-wise Robustness (ADT++), a novel adversarial training framework that significantly improves generalization robustness against unseen and sophisticated adversarial attacks. Following the standard adversarial training framework, ADT++ is formulated as a minmax optimization problem, where the inner maximization aims to learn the worst-case adversarial distribution around adversarial examples to further explore the perturbation space. The outer minimization seeks to find model parameters that minimize the expected loss of the maximum inner loss. To further improve the generalization robustness, ADT++ leverages the class-wise robustness phenomenon by targeting the most vulnerable image classes with high-loss adversarial attacks to generate more impactful adversarial examples. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and against various AT defense methods and adversarial attacks confirm the effectiveness of ADT++ in improving model robustness against stronger and adaptive attacks.

This research details the development of a soil erosion prediction system for the Piura region by integrating remote sensing, the RUSLE model, and deep learning. Our methodology involved two steps: first, building a multi-temporal geospatial database (2015–2024) on Google Earth Engine with 16 variables from Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and MODIS. Second, developing two convolutional neural network architectures to predict the RUSLE A-factor. AU-Net model was used for direct spatial prediction, while a ConvL-STM U-Net model was designed for spatio-temporal forecasting. Evaluation in a test data set confirmed the high performance of both models. The U-Net accurately predicted the spatial distribution of erosion (R2=0.9895, MSE=0.0006, MAE=0.0021), and the ConvLSTM U-Net successfully forecasted its evolution (R2=0.7820, MSE=0.0036, MAE=0.0303). We conclude that this integrated system offers a powerful and scalable solution for erosion assessment. The ability to generate precise susceptibility maps and anticipate future behavior provides a valuable tool for land use planning and conservation strategies in vulnerable regions."

The results were then experimentally validated, using temperature results measured with a thermographic camera for a potato sample. The numerical results show that in 90 seconds the temperature reached is between 80 and 85 °C. Likewise, the percentage of microwave energy absorption in the potato sample was approximately 44.22%.

This paper contributes a solution by providing a new translation of BTs to Petri Nets (PNs) to enable verification when the embedding context of the BT is modeled also as a PN. This ensures that safety and response properties about the overall robotic system can be assessed using state-of-the-art model checkers. Our method takes a BT, translates each node to a so-called PN template of the node's type and then composes the templates to obtain a single PN. Additionally, we introduce optimization strategies to reduce the size of the final model, improving computational efficiency while preserving verification accuracy. We report evaluation results on different case studies, including industry-related ones, demonstrating the feasibility and the scalability of our approach."

However, the transition to AI-driven processes introduces inherent risks related to financial investment, workforce adaptability, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and process disruptions. To systematically assess and mitigate these risks, this paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Petri-Net (FPN)-based risk assessment model. The model effectively captures the uncertainties associated with AI adoption by integrating fuzzy logic to quantify imprecise risk factors and employing Petri Nets to model the interdependencies among various risk components. The methodology involves defining risk factors, assigning fuzzy membership values, constructing a Petri Net representation, and executing dynamic risk propagation analysis. The proposed approach is validated through a case study on SME auto-component clusters, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying high-risk areas and providing structured decision-making insights. Comparative analysis with traditional risk assessment models highlights the advantages of the FPN framework in terms of adaptability, uncertainty handling, and practical applicability. The findings suggest that the proposed model can serve as a reliable decision-support tool, aiding SMEs in developing strategic AI implementation roadmaps while minimizing potential risks. Future research will focus on real-time risk assessment enhancements and adaptive learning-based optimizations."

    "abstract": "Colombia, the world's third-largest producer of Hass avocados, generates substantial agricultural waste, particularly from seeds and peels. This study explores the sustainable transformation of avocado seeds into bioethanol as a renewable energy source. With avocado production rising-especially in rural regions like Cundinamarcamanaging agro-industrial waste is critical. Avocado seeds, comprising approximately 55.67 % starch, present a valuable raw material for bioethanol production. The research employed a systematic literature review and developed a multi-step conversion process: starch extraction using alkaline solutions, enzymatic hydrolysis into fermentable sugars, fermentation with yeast, and ethanol recovery through distillation. Aspen Plus V11 simulation software was used to optimize production parameters, such as temperature and reagent concentration, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The results demonstrated that bioethanol derived from avocado seeds is a feasible alternative fuel. Although the production cost is slightly higher than gasoline, the environmental advantages-including reduced greenhouse gas emissions and decreased dependency on fossil fuels-outweigh the economic drawbacks. The process also holds potential for rural economic development by generating employment and diversifying income in avocado-growing regions. Despite limitations like seasonal raw material availability and the lower energy density of bioethanol compared to conventional fuels, the approach supports Colombia's goals in sustainability and energy diversification. Future research will focus on enhancing yield, reducing costs, and scaling infrastructure. Overall, converting avocado seeds into bioethanol represents a promising circular economy strategy that aligns with environmental, economic, and energy-transition objectives, offering a practical model for renewable energy generation from agricultural residues in Colombia."

The presented paper describes a novel procedure for the detection of long-lived particles provided for the needs of the above experiment. A problem that is investigated mainly relies on the determination of tracks (trajectories) of such particles based on observations obtained from measurement modules placed far apart; thus, such kind of detection is alternatively named a reconstruction. The main intention of the algorithm presented here constitutes the elimination of erroneously created tracks, the so-called ghost-tracks. The presented concept is based on elements of mathematical statistics (nonparametric estimation) as well as computational intelligence (neural networks, fuzzy approach). In order to measure the obtained effectiveness, an appropriate performance index which does not require information if the given track is real or only a ghost (as it occurs in practice) is defined. Finally, the number of ghost-tracks is reduced threefold in comparison to prior methods used. Illustrative interpretations make the presented concept easy to adopt in similar problems connected with detection/reconstruction of tracks/trajectories of elementary physical particles."

These frameworks reduce manual workload but create challenges for maintaining trustworthy, fair, and responsible analytics. Trustworthy analytics require human competencies to ensure explainability, fairness auditing, and ethical compliance, particularly where automation alone is insufficient. Existing taxonomies classify frameworks by technical scope but ignore the human competencies necessary for critical oversight. This paper addresses the gap by proposing a Competency-Aware Human-in-the-Loop (CA-HIL) Framework. The CA-HIL Framework systematically maps automation stages to intervention points, defines the associated risks, and identifies the specific human competencies required to mitigate these risks. Following the PRISMA methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) of 2241 research articles supports the framework's development. The evaluation applies CA-HIL to leading automation systems such as TPOT, Auto-Prep, and AutoDS to identify in-dispensable human interventions. The findings demonstrate how competency-aware intervention enhances transparency, fairness, and accountability in automated workflows. This study provides a structured, evidence-based approach for designing responsible data science automation systems that bridge technical efficiency with human ethical responsibility."

This study evaluates the vulnerability of a 33 kV line segment without lightning protection or shield wires, through the simulation of a detailed electrical model of direct lightning strikes. It was identified that lightning currents as low as 3 kA can cause disruptive discharges (flashovers) on phase conductors. As a mitigation measure, surge arresters were installed between towers 009 and 018, thus preventing the propagation of the lightning wave. Simulation results showed that, with this solution, the line can withstand lightning currents of up to 76 kA without producing flashover, representing a 91% probability of not exceeding the failure threshold. Furthermore, the use of surge arresters avoids the need to install shield wires, which would be costly and structurally complex in existing lines. Overall, the study confirms the effectiveness of strategically placed surge arresters as a technical and economic solution to improve service continuity under severe atmospheric conditions."

    "abstract": "Temporal variability in business processes represents a significant challenge in organizational mining, driven by changes in demand, regulatory requirements, or internal restructuring. These factors reconfigure the causal relationships among process roles, altering their interaction patterns. Detecting such changes in a timely manner is crucial to maintaining operational efficiency. Analyzing roles in temporally dynamic processes requires incorporating multiple perspectives to capture complex patterns in their evolving interactions. Interventions applied to these roles yield heterogeneous effects depending on their groupings and temporal contexts. To address this complexity, we propose an approach based on multiview autoencoders that capture diverse interaction perspectives among roles and enable clustering based on their latent patterns. This methodology uncovers specific causal relationships and estimates heterogeneous effects, supporting adaptive interventions for the roles involved. Validation was carried out using data from a payment services company, which revealed clusters of roles with similar patterns and identified their distinct causal relationships between temporal scenarios. This insight guided the design of targeted and focused interventions. This work contributes to organizational mining in temporally variable contexts through the integration of multiview autoencoders and causal inference techniques, thereby enabling adaptive interventions aligned with role-interaction patterns and their operational context."

Later on, it applies machine learning algorithms to analyse the data, which includes the applicant's spending patterns, financial history, and credit, and then it generates a personalised credit score. The assessment is always revised, consequently, their decision may be based on the most current data available. The system runs a risk profile for an application. Using artificial intelligence, it determines their creditworthiness, hence avoiding human examination and reducing the time and effort required to authorise a credit card. This enhances and accelerates the decision-making process for clients as well as bank personnel. The AI-powered Credit Scoring System also keeps learning and improving on newly collected information, enabling banks to constantly offer current credit scoring to properly represent market trends. Furthermore, for the banks, this technology reduces trust risk (i.e., decreases defaulting chance) as well as improves consumer experience."

    "abstract": "In modern power systems, the contact materials of high-voltage disconnect switches have long relied on copper-based materials, which are costly, and traditional copper-aluminum connection technologies (such as flash welding and brazing) are prone to failure due to stress concentration and corrosion. Therefore, this study proposes the use of cold spray technology to fabricate copper-aluminum bonded high-voltage disconnect switch contact blades, systematically investigating the effects of coating thickness (0.15 mm and 0.35 mm) and surface roughness (Ra0.8 and Ra3.2) on their service performance. Through mechanical switching tests (1200 cycles) and neutral salt spray tests (120 hours), the temperature rise, loop resistance, and wear characteristics of the contact blades were evaluated. The results indicate that surface roughness significantly affects mechanical lifespan. For instance, the Ra0.8 samples exhibited a temperature rise of only 44.2 °C after mechanical switching with the lowest increase in loop resistance (3.69 μΩ) and minimal contact wear (scratch depth of 4 μm). In contrast, the Ra3.2 samples showed a temperature rise of 54.7 °C with the highest increase in loop resistance (20.01 μΩ) and severe groove formation on the contacts (maximum depth of 215 μm). Under neutral salt spray conditions, the Ra0.8 samples demonstrated stable temperature rise (44 °C), outperforming traditional pure copper contact blades. This study validates the feasibility of replacing pure copper contacts with cold-sprayed copper-aluminum bonded contact blades, providing technical support for the low-cost, high-performance design of high-voltage disconnect switches."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive analysis of wind power generation forecasting in Peru using machine learning algorithms and outlier detection techniques. The research employed Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict wind power generation across 13 companies using a two-year dataset (May 2023 - April 2025). A 7-day sliding window approach was implemented to forecast daily generation, with models trained on temporal features, lagged values, and rolling statistics. Exploratory data analysis revealed significant variability in generation capacity across companies, with monthly generation ranging from 359 GWh to 825 GWh, showing 42.0% growth between study years. The capacity factor decreased from 33.0% in Year 1 to 22.5% in Year 2, indicating rapid capacity expansion. Random Forest demonstrated superior performance with R2 = 0.438, MAE = 3,700.43 MWh, and RMSE = 4,734.9 MWh, followed by SVR (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.423). Company-specific analysis showed heterogeneous performance, with ENGIE facilities achieving the highest predictability (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> > 0.45), while some companies exhibited negative R2 values. Outlier detection using IQR methods improved model stability by reducing RMSE = 226.63 to 198.51 MWh, though slightly decreasing R2 = 0.418 to 0.327."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the impacts of higher education students' participation in robotics projects on their academic retention and success. Drawing on the analysis of experiences and project proposals developed in the Triangulo Mineiro region of Brazil, the study discusses how educational robotics can enhance student engagement, motivation, and the development of essential skills, thereby contributing to reduced dropout rates and improved academic performance. The distinctions between educational and pedagogical robotics, as well as the historical context of their application in Brazil, are examined. Recent experiences employing machine learning and data visualization to assess the impacts of robotics initiatives-including those aimed at increasing female participation-underscore the relevance and the need for more in-depth analyses. Although direct statistical data to quantify causal effects remain limited in publicly available databases for this specific region, qualitative evidence and practical examples based on local initiatives indicate a significant positive impact. The study highlights the importance of such initiatives for the comprehensive education of students in engineering and technology programs."

    "abstract": "Climate change presents a complex global challenge, demanding models that not only deliver accurate forecasts but also unpack the causal mechanisms behind observed phenomena. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hybrid models, causal inference techniques, and entropy-guided metaheuristic optimization approaches used in climate science, emphasizing interpretability and adaptability. Focusing on temperature anomalies and atmospheric CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> data, we examine how physics-informed neural networks and machine learning methods can integrate domain knowledge for improved interpretability. Causal inference frameworks—from structural causal models to counterfactual analysis—help separate true causal drivers (such as anthropogenic emissions) from confounding environmental variables. Concurrently, metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization) address multi-objective problems, enabling efficient resource allocation and emissions mitigation strategies. Recent studies demonstrate that synergy among these methods leads to robust climate predictions, actionable scientific advisory group insights, and adaptable frameworks for resilience planning. By spotlighting real-world case studies—from flood susceptibility mapping to renewable energy optimization—the review underscores the importance of bridging empirical data, physical laws, and computational heuristics for integrated climate solutions. While challenges persist in data quality, model scalability, and the interpretability of advanced AI architectures, ongoing interdisciplinary work promises to refine both the accuracy and transparency of climate models. This paper concludes by outlining future research directions that emphasize hybrid causal modeling, real-time data assimilation, and socioeconomic feedback loops, ultimately aiming to strengthen science-driven responses to the climate crisis."

    "abstract": "The primary goals of advanced cryptographic systems are data security and privacy protection. Protecting sensitive information has always been critical, especially with the frequent use of cloud service platforms. Traditional encryption solutions have the disadvantage of requiring data to be decrypted before processing. Data must be protected when at rest in the cloud. Encryption is essential when using public cloud services at both processing and storage levels, i.e., in motion. It is feasible to process encrypted data using a modern cryptographic technique known as homomorphic encryption. This paper discusses the background knowledge needed to understand homomorphic encryption techniques. Based on their efficiency, key generation, encryption, decryption, computation time, and homomorphic functionality, the two partial homomorphic approaches: Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Goldwasser-Micali (GM) Cryptosystem are examined and contrasted. The results indicate that while the GM Cryptosystem offers higher security due to probabilistic encryption, it is computationally inefficient for large-scale cloud applications. In contrast, RSA provides a balance between security and performance, making it more suitable for practical cloud security implementations."

Although promising, achromatic metagratings’ diffraction efficiency needs to be improved. We propose an inverse design method using a quantum genetic algorithm for achromatic slanted metagratings. Two designs with 20° and 40° fields of view exhibit diffraction efficiencies as high as 29% ± 1% for RGB wavelengths at normal incidence and excellent angular and spectral uniformity. The proposed single-layer manufacturable structures offer a promising route to future full-color waveguide displays."

    "abstract": "Incremental multiview clustering (IMVC) leverages consistent information between historical and new views to benefit the clustering task. However, existing IMVC approaches ignore the redundant information in individual views, leading to an accumulation of irrelevance. Besides, with the continuous arrivals of new views, the knowledge learned from historical views is often forgotten, which hinders the learning models from achieving long-term dependencies across incremental views. In this study, we propose a novel progressive information bottleneck (PIB), which is capable of removing redundant information in a timely manner and selectively updating historical knowledge based on information gain of new views. Specifically, to facilitate the knowledge transfer from historical views to incoming one, an information-aware knowledge library is built to store the representative samples of historical views. With the emergence of new views, we first devise a matrix-based mutual information (MI) constraint on an encoder to compress redundant information, which facilitates the training of a neural network with analyzable gradients and obtain a compact yet discriminative representation. Then, a dual-selective updating strategy is proposed to preserve historical knowledge in time when it contributes more to the information gain of the knowledge library than the new view. Finally, relevant samples to the new view in knowledge library are migrated to maximize the cross-level consistency between historical and new views. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that designs a gradient-analyzable MI measurement for incremental multiview learning and employs information gain to guide the selective update of the knowledge library. Empirical evaluations on six benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by an average of 8.1%, 7.6%, and 7.8% on clustering accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted Rand index (ARI) metrics, respectively."
