    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution reconstruction is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, which seeks to enhance the spatial resolution of low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) by integrating complementary information from high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs), ultimately generating high-resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs). Existing methods commonly employ residual connections and deep layer stacking to facilitate information propagation. While residual connections effectively preserve gradient flow, we observe that naively increasing network depth in high-dimensional spectral tasks can lead to feature redundancy and performance saturation. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel Butterfly residual network (BRNet) that incorporates spectral Transformers and depth-wise convolutions to optimize both accuracy and computational efficiency of hyperspectral super-resolution reconstruction from two perspectives: learning strategy and feature extraction. Regarding learning strategy, a recursive structure coupled with a fusion parameter generation technique is proposed to promote efficient feature fusion and enable adaptive network pruning, thereby reducing redundant information and enhancing computational efficiency. For feature extraction, spectral Transformer and depth-wise convolution are employed to capture spectral and spatial features, respectively, effectively leveraging their complementary advantages across different dimensions. A specialized spectral-spatial interaction (SSI) module is then incorporated to effectively fuse the extracted features, thereby enriching the diversity of network features. Additionally, the convolutional gated feed-forward network (FFN) is designed to bolster the network’s ability to capture local features while significantly reducing the computational complexity. Experimental evaluations on three hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art super-resolution reconstruction methods across various performance metrics, validating its effectiveness and superiority."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) offers millisecond-level resolution of brain activity. However, its clinical utility is limited by artefacts and its non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. Deep learning has been utilised to model EEG data and learn recurrent, high-level representations, particularly through disentangled representation learning. However, the resulting models and their latent representations are often difficult to interpret because of their unstable and high-dimensional nature. To address this gap, a participant-generalised β weighted Variational Autoencoder (β VAE) is trained on pooled EEG spatially preserved topographic maps from multichannel data. Subsequently, its latent space is explained via HuberAIME, an extension of the model-agnostic Approximate Inverse Model Explanations (AIME) method. In detail, it computes an approximate inverse of the encoder under a Huber loss constraint, providing global feature importance maps for every latent dimension. This is tested against two state-of-the-art explainable AI (XAI) methods, LIME AND SHAP, utilising multichannel EEG data recorded from various participants. The findings demonstrate that HuberAIME produces mutually exclusive and anatomically significant scalp patterns, with each latent axis consistently linked to distinct electrophysiological topographies across all participants. Compared with LIME and SHAP, HuberAIME preserved the distinctiveness of the axis and spatial coherence, ensuring stable and interpretable mappings. In addition, it is significantly faster than LIME which requires several hours and assigns similar importance maps to multiple axes, and it is superior to SHAP, which is computationally prohibitive and produces spatially incoherent explanations. This study contributed to the body of knowledge by proposing an original deep generative learning and interpretability pipeline (β – VAE + HuberAIME), a fast and principled method for linking disentangled EEG latents to concrete, consistent, and organised EEG topographic maps. This enables the reliable and consistent use of learned features across participants, potentially paving new paths for scientific discovery and generalizable diagnostics."

    "abstract": "This article focuses on prescribed-time distributed robust Nash equilibrium seeking for monotone games impacted by unknown and time-varying disturbances. First, a regularization term with a prescribed-time decaying parameter is introduced to compensate for the absence of strong monotonicity in the merely monotone game. Based on the regularization technique, a new prescribed-time signum-based distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm incorporating an integral sliding mode method, a leader-following consensus protocol, and a gradient algorithm is presented for monotone games with unknown but bounded disturbances. Then, to dispose of the unknown bounds of disturbances, a prescribed-time distributed adaptive integral sliding mode based Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is devised. On the basis of the proposed strategies, some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee that the players’ actions are capable of converging to the least-norm Nash equilibrium of the monotone games in a prescribed time. In the end, numerical simulations on least-distance formation control of a network of players testify to the performance of the proposed seeking strategies."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of automotive technologies and the widespread adoption of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), the need for accurate and real-time information regarding not only the ego vehicle but also surrounding vehicles—such as their positions and velocities—has become critical. However, sensors used to measure the states of surrounding vehicles are inherently limited by issues such as blind spots, occlusions, and signal delays, which can hinder the reliable operation of assistance systems. To address this challenge, this study proposes a sensor fusion estimator based on an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) with delay compensation, aimed at improving the accuracy and continuity of preceding vehicle tracking. The proposed estimator integrates data from GPS, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, Radar, and IMU by utilizing a kinematic sensor dynamics model that does not require detailed vehicle-specific characteristics. This approach compensates for the weaknesses of individual sensors and ensures robust state estimation. To cope with various signal update rates and signal loss, a measurement model switching method is employed. Additionally, delay compensation enables the estimation of the current states of surrounding vehicles. The proposed estimator is validated using sensor data collected from real vehicles in diverse scenarios and environment, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance."

    "abstract": "Accurate superpixel segmentation of ocean remote sensing data plays a crucial role in the success of monitoring the changes on the ocean surface. Recently, so many superpixel segmentation methods have attracted much attention to ocean remote sensing images. However, most of these previous methods perform their superpixel segmentation just with the color feature and location information, but without considering the characters amounts of indistinguishable pixels between objects and background on ocean remote sensing images. It results in a huge quantity of segmentation errors. To overcome the above limits, a foreground-background separation and independent multicycle labeling-based (FSIML) superpixel segmentation method is proposed in this paper, which is done to improve the superpixel segmentation accuracy on ocean datasets. First, we combine the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and two-stage mathematical morphology operations to classify an initial image into two kinds: foreground and background. Second, a novel disorderly superpixel set can be obtained by the foreground-background separation and an original superpixel set generated with an existing superpixel generation technique. To complete the re-labeling of superpixel, we introduce an independent multicycle definition to find all closed cycles on the basis of Hamilton cycle theory. Then, all the pixels surrounded by each cycle can be set to a new label. Experiments show that the superpixel segmentation results generated by the proposed method are better than the state-of-the-art superpixel geneation methods on ocean remote sensing image datasets."

However, current studies frequently only use text-based methods, which limit their capacity to capture the structural linkages found in technology knowledge. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines text embedding and network embedding to analyze technology evolution paths. Using a dataset of 35983 patents in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) domain, we extract high-dimensional semantic features from patent texts while simultaneously capturing structural relationships between patents by constructing a heterogeneous information network. By fusing these two embeddings, we construct technology evolution paths based on cosine similarity measures. The proposed method effectively reveals knowledge diffusion patterns and emerging technology trends. In addition, through pair sample t-test and topic coherence analysis, we found that the proposed method identifies more comprehensive technology evolution trajectories."

The practical deployment of airborne nodes is restricted by onboard energy limitations, motivating the use of energy harvesting techniques. In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of the power consumption of HAPSs and rotary-wing UAVs. We delve into consumption patterns across various flight phases, shedding light on the multifaceted impact of diverse system and operational parameters on overall energy utilization. We then present a thorough analysis of energy harvesting methods. First, we examine solar energy harvesting and demonstrate its dependence on factors such as operational altitude, geographical location, climate conditions, and daylight duration. Subsequently, we introduce laser power beaming as a more predictable and controllable energy source. Thereafter, we discuss the feasibility of self-sustainable airborne networks based on these energy harvesting techniques and typical energy consumption patterns."

    "abstract": "Conventional soft–rigid coupled grippers typically rely on multiple actuators for compliant, high-force manipulation, which increases mechanical complexity. To overcome these limitations, this article presents a soft–rigid coupled gripper driven by a single self-sensing Kresling origami actuator. This actuator provides both volume output for the soft finger and linear displacement for the exoskeleton within a single structure. By embedding magnetic sensors into the origami module and developing a decoupled physical sensing model, we achieve precise, real-time monitoring of the rotation angle and height, with average measurement errors below 0.5% and 1.2%, respectively. This enables closed-loop control of finger motion, as well as the detection and adaptive compensation of external disturbances. Furthermore, an electromagnetic locking mechanism enables rapid switching between a compliant soft mode and a robust hybrid mode, supporting versatile manipulation strategies. Experimental results show that, compared with the soft mode, the hybrid mode increases fingertip blocked and pull-off forces by 311% and 256%, respectively. This dual-mode operation, enabled by the lock, directly enhances the gripper's adaptability and functionality. These results demonstrate the practicality of the proposed soft–rigid coupled gripper, which integrates multifunctional actuation and embedded sensing, for advanced manipulation."

Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation."

    "abstract": "In the field of ancient manuscript rejoining, particularly for Dunhuang manuscripts, traditional approaches often focus on complete manuscripts or real paired fragments while overlooking orphan fragments, which are equally critical for restoration. Due to natural degradation and improper preservation methods, most Dunhuang manuscripts survive only as fragmented remnants. Scholars have traditionally relied on prior rejoining experience to guide the restoration of orphan fragments, a process that often takes years and achieves limited success. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised pairwise matching approach designed to assist scholars in digital fragment rejoining. We construct a dataset comprising complete manuscripts, real paired fragments, and orphan fragments, and apply a detailed preprocessing scheme that integrates expert knowledge as implicit constraints without requiring manual annotations. A novel feature encoding—BFAz encoding (Binary Freeman Code with Azimuth Information)—is introduced to provide robust matching cues. To address the scarcity of positive samples and the difficulty of annotating fragment similarity, we develop a self-augmentation strategy that generates supervisory signals by learning global fragment features, forming fragment groups to establish positive and negative sample relationships. Pairwise similarity is then quantified using a Siamese network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach efficiently prioritizes correct rejoining candidates, highlighting the potential of computer-assisted restoration technologies in archaeological research."

Towards this end, in this work we introduce a novel and interpretable large language model framework Meta-XAML, enhanced by meta-learning, for more intelligent and transparent AML transaction monitoring in low-shot setting. On the one hand, the task adaptive meta-learner is capable of dynamically adapting the model parameters to the heterogeneity of customer behavior and trans-jurisdictional differences. Secondly, the attribution-guided interpretation module makes attention aligned with the causal mask mechanism of Shapley value, to achieve legally traceable interpretation for high-risk transactions. Furthermore, the model also formulates the objective of prototype constraint contrast learning for better semantic alignment and more robust expression under few shots. By jointly optimizing multiple objectives loss functions, the entire model is forced to be optimized to ensure: the classification accuracy, interpretation credibility, and cross-domain generalization ability. Experiments on the AML trading dataset demonstrate that Meta-XAML achieves 8.6% F1-score gain over the state-of-the-art competitors."

Multi-concept customization emerges as the challenging task within this domain. Existing approaches often rely on training a fusion matrix of multiple Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) to merge various concepts into a single image. However, we identify this straightforward method faces two major challenges: 1) concept confusion, where the model struggles to preserve distinct individual characteristics, and 2) concept vanishing, where the model fails to generate the intended subjects. To address these issues, we introduce LoRA-Composer, a training-free framework designed for seamlessly integrating multiple LoRAs, thereby enhancing the harmony among different concepts within generated images. LoRA-Composer addresses concept vanishing through concept injection constraints, enhancing visibility via an expanded cross-attention mechanism. To combat concept confusion, concept isolation constraints are introduced, refining the self-attention computation. Furthermore, we propose two inference techniques to accelerate inference speed without performance degradation and enhance the accuracy of the generated region, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-Composer significantly outperforms standard baselines, especially in scenarios without image-based conditions such as canny edge or pose estimation."

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest academic research in these domains, strictly focusing on literature published from October 2024 to the present. The analysis reveals several key trends shaping the field. In TSR, architectural evolution is characterized by the refinement of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the specialization of light-weight YOLO-based models for real-time embedded applications, and the emergence of hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures. Concurrently, a significant research thrust is dedicated to enhancing robustness against environmental adversities and a growing spectrum of sophisticated, physically plausible adversarial attacks. In LLR, the paradigm is rapidly shifting from 2D image-plane detection to full 3D spatial localization and topology reasoning, driven by Transformer-based models that excel at capturing global context and long-range dependencies. Cross-cutting themes common to both domains include a relentless drive for computational efficiency, a data-centric approach marked by the creation of new, challenging benchmarks for adverse conditions and 3D perception, and the nascent but transformative integration of multi-task learning and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to build systems capable of holistic scene reasoning. Despite significant progress, several key challenges persist in the field of domain generalization, particularly in handling long-tail corner cases and developing safety-aware evaluation metrics. Future research is expected to focus on self-supervised learning, stronger integration between perception and control systems, and the advancement of trustworthy AI through improved explainability and robust-ness.

As IoT devices proliferate in urban and remote environments, the twin challenges of energy sustainability and maintenance overhead present significant barriers to widespread adoption. Our solution leverages solar energy harvesting (EH) coupled with innovative power management strategies to create truly autonomous environmental sensing nodes with zero carbon footprint and minimal maintenance requirements. By eliminating batteries and optimizing energy consumption patterns, this approach offers a scalable model for future IoT deployments that can operate indefinitely under diverse environmental conditions. The system demonstrates how renewable energy integration at the device level can transform IoT implementations from maintenance-intensive, environmentally-problematic deployments to sustainable, set-and-forget solutions. This study presents ClimateCube, an environmental sensor that measures temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, and air quality (including eCO2 and TVOC), transmitting wireless data, powered exclusively by solar cells and supercapacitors. The system demonstrated continuous operation for 24 hours using only the energy stored with optimized hibernation consumption without solar power, and achieved a transmission success rate of approximately 98 % while maintaining full autonomy. Experimental validation demonstrated that a 5.0 V supercapacitor charge sustained 30 consecutive transmissions at 30-minute intervals, equivalent to 15 hours of autonomous operation, validating the energy budget calculations and confirming the viability of supercapacitor-based energy storage for IoT applications."

    "abstract": "Efficient workload scheduling is a critical challenge in modern heterogeneous computing environments, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Traditional software-based schedulers struggle to efficiently balance workload distribution due to high scheduling overhead, lack of adaptability to dynamic workloads, and suboptimal resource utilization. These pitfalls are compounded in heterogeneous systems, where differing computational elements can have vastly different performance profiles. To resolve these hindrances, we present a novel FPGA-based accelerator for stochastic online scheduling (SOS). We modify a greedy cost selection assignment policy by adapting existing cost equations to engage with discretized time before implementing them into a hardware accelerator design. Our design leverages hardware parallelism, precalculation, and precision quantization to reduce job scheduling latency. By introducing a hardware-accelerated approach to real-time scheduling, this paper establishes a new paradigm for adaptive scheduling mechanisms in heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed design achieves high throughput, low latency, and energy-efficient operation, offering a scalable alternative to traditional software scheduling methods. Experimental results demonstrate consistent workload distribution, fair machine utilization, and up to 1060× speedup over single-threaded software scheduling policy implementations. This makes the SOS accelerator a strong candidate for deployment in high-performance computing system, deep-learning pipelines, and other performance-critical applications."

    "abstract": "Electromigration (EM) remains a critical reliability concern in advanced integrated circuit design. Traditional physics-based approaches, which solve partial differential equations (PDEs), are computationally intensive, particularly in multi-physics scenarios. To address the issue, we propose a self-consistent lumped element modeling framework that leverages the equivalence between electrical behavior and stress evolution to forecast EM-induced stress under coupled electro-thermomechanical effects. Thermomechanical interactions driven by temperature gradients are explicitly modeled using embedded controlled sources. A threshold-activated switching mechanism is proposed to dynamically reconfigure circuit topology, enabling seamless simulation across both void nucleation and post-voiding phases. The proposed adaptive non-uniform spatial discretization framework can be used to enhance computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate >50× speedup against the finite element simulation for small interconnects with <1.5% error, and 3.11× acceleration over conventional equivalent circuits for large-scale structures while maintaining <0.5% error. Fully compatible with standard SPICE solver, the proposed approach exhibits strong potential for temperature-aware EM analysis and void prediction in full-chip VLSI applications."

    "abstract": "Processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have attracted significant attention in computer architecture research due to their ability to mitigate the memory wall bottleneck for deep neural network (DNN) applications. In-memory computing (IMC) using ReRAM crossbar arrays is promising for energy efficiency but suffers from high-cost peripheral circuits, particularly analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). There are existing methods to reduce ADC energy consumption, such as lowering resolution or sharing an ADC among multiple columns. Unfortunately, these techniques reduce throughput. In this work, we propose OptiRange for PIM accelerators that enhances both energy efficiency and throughput while maintaining accuracy and model flexibility. OptiRange proposes a split-the-burden (STB) algorithm that manipulates crossbar cell values without changing the weights. STB reduces large cell values, shifts the column-sum distribution center closer to zero, and minimizes the number of low-resistance state (LRS) cells, significantly lowering the hardware-level fixed ADC resolution and improving accuracy. Furthermore, OptiRange utilizes dynamic ADC range (DAR) adaptation, determining the optimal ADC operating range per column at the software level and enabling the skipping of redundant ADC conversion cycles at runtime. An associated ADC range-based grouping (AG) strategy leverages the resulting dynamic latencies to manage synchronization and further boost system throughput. By combining weight-preserving cell manipulation with adaptive ADC operation and synchronization, OptiRange dynamically optimizes the ADC workload. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly enhances overall performance compared to conventional ReRAM-based accelerators."

While conventional approaches primarily focus on wirelength minimization, the impact of feedthrough pin assignment on internal routing congestion has been relatively overlooked. Our observation reveals that proper assignment of feedthrough pins can significantly reduce routing congestion without increasing wirelength. In this paper, we present COPA, a Congestion-Oriented Pin Assignment framework that explicitly targets congestion mitigation within intra-block routing regions. By formulating the feedthrough pin assignment problem as a nonlinear optimization task, COPA employs a gradient-based algorithm that iteratively adjusts pin positions based on congestion severity, quantified through a routing-demand-driven metric. Experimental results on industrial testcases demonstrate that COPA achieves an average 7.6% reduction in total overflow, with a maximum improvement of up to 9%, compared to initial feedthrough pin assignments generated by a commercial EDA tool."

To address these limitations, we introduce LLM4Verilog, an exploratory, collaborative initiative aimed at constructing a large-scale, high-quality, open-source Verilog dataset. Our initiative integrates a community-driven data collection pipeline with a two-stage data filtering technique to ensure high dataset quality. The first stage removes duplicates and low-quality samples, resulting in a large-scale dataset called LLM4Verilog-complete. The second stage applies an LLM-driven quality scoring method, VeriScore, to perform fine-grained filtering and produce a high-quality, ready-to-use dataset called LLM4Verilog-filtered. We evaluate the effectiveness of these datasets through fine-tuning three different LLMs on our dataset, achieving 6.6%~11.2% and 5.3%~13.2% improvements in pass@1 scores on VerilogEval-human and VerilogEval-Machine, respectively, compared to models fine-tuned with prior state-of-the-art datasets. Notably, these improvements are achieved without relying on complex fine-tuning or data augmentation techniques, highlighting our dataset’s strong potential as a foundational resource for enhancing LLMs’ Verilog code generation capabilities.

To address this issue, various defense mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing works exhibit deficiencies in terms of performance overhead, coverage of attacks, and detection accuracy. In response to these challenges, we propose CacheGuardian, a hardware-based LLC protection design which aims to provide stronger, broader, and more accurate protection against timing side-channel attacks with low performance overhead. It includes: (1) A behavior-based, generic attack detector capable of identifying multiple timing side-channel attacks in real time; (2) A cache-set-level access control mechanism that strictly restricts cache usage exclusively for the identified attackers instead of influencing all security domains.We implement our design in a gem5 simulator to evaluate both its security and performance. Our proof-of-concept attacks and SPEC 2017 benchmarks show that our design is effective against a wide range of timing side-channel attacks, reducing attack success rates by up to 256×, including camouflaged variants. Moreover, it improves the performance of benign workloads by an average of 2.26% with only 2.4% storage overhead."

These redundant loads fetch the same value from the same address throughout the execution of the program, and are called global stable loads (GSLs). We explore the behavior of GSLs across different architectures, compilers, and compiler optimizations. We also study GSLs in emerging ML workloads that are not explored in prior work. Our characterization of SPEC programs reveal a high locality in GSLs, that only 4.2-5.2% of static GSLs are responsible for 90-95% of the dynamic GSLs. We identify the reasons behind these dominant static GSLs, and posit that many of these GSLs are identifiable by the compiler prior to execution.In contrast to using a purely microarchitectural solution to eliminate GSLs, we consider a compiler-hardware co-designed solution wherein the compiler marks the likely stable loads, and the microarchitecture uses a small and fast cache to service these loads quickly and efficiently. We achieve a maximum speedup up to 7.43% for SPEC Float programs, and attain an energy reduction of 12.95% for the L1-D cache. We achieve these results using minimal hardware and without the need for a complex microarchitectural mechanism, yet the results are similar to state-of-the-art solutions."

Traditional DRC for 2D layouts involves checks on parameters including line width, spacing, and density. With the advancement of 3D IC and advanced packaging technologies, new DRC requirements have emerged. These include checks on inter-die spacing, alignment relationships, and the handling of non-Manhattan geometries. Previous academic research has focused almost exclusively on optimizing 2D DRC. Meanwhile, industrial tools such as Calibre 3DSTACK can only perform 3D rule checks on layouts that have already passed 2D DRC, which increases both workflow complexity and time consumption. Targeted at these limitations, we propose 3D DRC, a U-Net-based DRC tool designed for 3D IC. Our method performs both 2D and 3D rule checks in a single pass on 3D structures, with specific optimizations for non-Manhattan geometries in 3D IC. Additionally, the tool also supports traditional 2D DRC when applied to purely 2D layouts. We evaluated the performance of 3D DRC on a variety of open-source PDK rule sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model exhibits strong generalization and high accuracy, achieving an average recall of 97.5% and precision of 97.7%. Furthermore, the model demonstrates high runtime efficiency, with the 2D mode running 22.3× faster than Calibre nmDRC, and the 3D mode being 13.3× faster than Calibre 3DSTACK."

Second, it performs variation-aware optimization using heteroscedastic Gaussian processes (HGP) to model circuit performance under process variations, capturing the non-uniform nature of process-induced fluctuations across the design space. The HGP models are combined with an efficient acquisition function based on Thompson sampling to guide the exploration of robust designs using limited Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, it refines the solutions through additional targeted Monte Carlo simulations and model calibration.

This paper starts by revisiting VC-less routing through link ordering schemes in Full-mesh networks, which offer implementation simplicity but suffer from performance degradation under adversarial traffic. Thus, to overcome these challenges, we propose TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm), a novel routing algorithm which employs an embedded physical subnetwork to provide deadlock-free non-minimal paths without using VCs. In a Full-mesh network, TERA outperforms link ordering routing algorithms by 80% when dealing with adversarial traffic, and up to 100% in application kernels. Furthermore, compared to other VC-based approaches, it reduces buffer requirements by 50%, while maintaining comparable latency and throughput. Lastly, early results from a 2D-HyperX evaluation show that TERA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms that use the same number of VCs, achieving performance improvements of up to 32%.

Two TREIT approaches were considered: 1. including prostate boundary information (EIT-P) and 2. including prostate and tumor boundary information (EIT-P+T). Both simple electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) metrics and the two imaging approaches (EIT-P and EIT-P+T) were evaluated with respect to biopsy core, 3D (EIT-P) image, and tumor-grade data. Best AUCs of 0.85, 0.84, and 0.83 were found when considering increasing volumes of tissue (0.8%, 2.7%, and 15% of the prostate). The largest measurement volume (15%), which utilized EIT-P, sensed significantly more prostate tissue than the standard biopsy only approach (<1%). These represent large improvement compared to prior clinical EIS biopsy and TREIT studies. Tumor-grade analysis (via EIT-P+T) appears to show promise but more data is required to confirm this. Overall, the study made important strides in developing the TREIT technique and further investigation, likely in an in vivo study, appears merited."

From this, a generalized framework using the real part of the BIS with a subtraction diagnostic function is proposed. The framework can be implemented with any method that extracts frequency components, and a Fourier Series method is presented as an example. The connection between the framework and existing methods is clarified, showing that all methods identify the defect-induced residual component but differ in mathematical form and sensitivity enhancement strategies. Simulations and experiments validate the analysis, demonstrating that the proposed Fourier Series method achieves accuracy comparable to existing approaches while providing a unified perspective on BIS-based defect localization methods."

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based remote sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) has achieved remarkable progress. However, conventional super-resolution methods usually assume a fixed and known degradation process (e.g., bicubic downsampling), which often leads to significant performance degradation when applied to real-world data with diverse and unknown degradations. To overcome this limitation, we propose DCR-SRNet, a novel Degradation-Contrastive and Wavelet-Guided Network for blind RSISR. The proposed network incorporates three key innovations: First, we design a contrastive degradation representation learning strategy that disentangles degradation priors from scene semantics by pulling together representations of identical degradations across different scenes while pushing apart those of different degradations within the same scene. Second, we introduce a wavelet-guided patch-wise weighted loss module, which employs wavelet decomposition and patch-level discrimination scores to adaptively reweight the pixel-wise loss, thereby enhancing the recovery of edge and texture details. Third, we design an adaptive modulation block (AMB) that injects degradation priors into the reconstruction process through feature- and channel-wise modulation, enabling robust adaptation to diverse degradations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark remote sensing datasets demonstrate that DCR-SRNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in preserving structural and textural details."

Lowering the bending resistance of actuating cables is critical, particularly when tool diameters are small and cable tension is limited. Traditional methods rely on costly, low-resistance materials. This study proposes a cost-effective design using multiple thin stainless-steel cables and cable slots instead of single cables and conventional cable holes. To optimize the proposed multi-cable design, simulations and polynomial regression were employed to determine the ideal slot dimensions, focusing on reducing bending resistance. Kinematic analysis and experiments confirmed reduced bending resistance in multi-cable designs. A 3 mm prototype showed 25% higher bending force and 63% increased bending distance under a 1.196 N payload compared to single-cable mechanisms. Circular trajectory experiments demonstrated improved accuracy and reduced velocity variation. A prototype successfully excised a tumor from a BALB/c mouse, verifying sufficient force for surgical tasks.

The evader’s objective is to reach a designated target area while avoiding the pursuers, whose aim is to intercept the evader. First, we reformulate the SEMP RADG game as an optimal control problem within a weighted communication topology graph by incorporating the interception and control errors. Then, optimal control strategies that account for input saturation are derived by solving the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. These strategies are shown to constitute the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the game. In addition, four types of pursuers, namely, isolated, passive, invisible, and regular pursuers, are defined based on the communication topology, and the conditions for achieving an Interactive Nash Equilibrium (INE), which is proposed for SEMP RADG games, are analyzed. Moreover, a single-network approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm using concurrent learning (CL) is proposed to provide the near-optimal solutions to the coupled HJ equations. Asymptotic capture conditions are established through an examination of equilibrium points, and extensions to general pursuit-evasion (PE) games and half-space targets are further discussed. Our results are validated through numerical simulations."

A Halbach-equivalent permanent magnet (PM) excitation system is implemented using uniformly magnetized NdFeB blocks arranged in a precision mold, eliminating the need for complex magnetization. The machine incorporates a slotless, concentric four-phase armature winding placed in air gap to minimize internal impedance, leakage, and mutual inductance. Passive compensation using an aluminum shield ensures uniform inductance during rotor rotation by inducing image currents. Key electromagnetic parameters, such as air-gap flux density and self-inductance, are derived through transient finite element analysis (FEA) and verified through experimental result. A prototype is fabricated and tested under open-circuit and resistive loads. Experimental results closely align with FEA predictions, confirming accuracy of the design approach.

Traditional time series models, such as ARIMA, and conventional machine learning models, like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), often struggle to capture the nonlinear characteristics of the stock market, resulting in low forecasting accuracy [1]. This paper introduces a hybrid model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks optimized with Genetic Algorithms (GA) and text sentiment analysis using pre-trained language models based on BERT and the cnsenti package. This approach effectively captures features from multimodal data, leading to improved predictions for Nvidia's stock price. To enhance the model's ability to learn from stock splits, we apply a price adjustment technique for continuity. The LSTM model, based on historical data, predicts stock prices, while the sentiment analysis model extracts insights from financial news. We utilize a weighted fusion approach to combine these predictions, providing a more comprehensive outlook on stock price movements. The final evaluation includes multiple performance metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and compares our model with general LSTM. Experimental results show that our hybrid method outperforms traditional LSTM models in terms accuracy and precision, offering a more robust framework for stock price forecasting."

Nevertheless, arc suppression methods based on current compensation suffer from fundamental residual currents (passive), complicated control process and strict implementation conditions (active). In this study, we propose arc suppression based on passive voltage reduction for grounding faults via reverse potential compensation. As single-phase voltage regulation in medium-voltage distribution networks barely affects line voltage, the inherent line voltage phasor was extracted from the secondary side of a single-phase isolation transformer, and the phase sequence of the source potential was reconfigured and fed back to the neutral node of the distribution network. In this way, the fault phase voltage can be kept below the arc ignition threshold at the fault site, thereby achieving arc suppression. Additionally, voltage characteristics at resistor ends were identified, and fault identification criteria were constructed accordingly. The proposed method was validated by dynamic simulation."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation. Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement in accuracy, 150 × faster compilation, and 2 × energy efficiency gain compared to existing baselines."

While many CPU-based approaches emphasize wirelength reduction, GPU-based approaches primarily focus on accelerating detailed placement without sacrificing quality. However, leveraging GPU parallelism to further improve placement quality remains largely underexplored. As existing optimization steps have approached the practical limits of wirelength optimization, achieving further improvements has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we propose a GPU-based detailed placement flow featuring Simultaneous Row and Order Assignment (SROA) step, a novel step that integrates dynamic programming-based row assignment with heuristic-based cell position adjustment. SROA enables efficient exploration of a significantly larger solution space on GPUs. Experimental results show that our approach preserves routability while reducing detailed routing wirelength and via count by 1.35% and 1.03%, respectively, compared to the ABCDPlace solutions."

    "abstract": "Approximate computing (AxC) reduces power consumption with minimal accuracy loss, benefiting error-tolerant, compute-intensive tasks such as machine learning, deep learning, and image processing. However, existing AxC methods often ignore the vulnerability to soft errors. Such errors can interact with approximation-induced errors, causing system failures or unexpected exceptions. To our knowledge, no work has addressed both soft error resilience and exception avoidance in approximate floating-point computing. This gap is particularly critical in deep neural network (DNN) inference, where soft error-induced errors or exceptions can significantly affect the stability and accuracy of computations.In this paper, we introduce SERA-Float, an approximate floating-point format resilient to soft errors. Specifically, it is designed to protect floating-point computations from soft error-induced errors and exception-triggering bit-flips. Unlike prior floating-point formats, SERA-Float protects the sign and exponent bits using error-correcting codes and relies on storing 8 valid bits of mantissa rather than performing coarse truncation. Additionally, by tracking critical bits in the floating-point representation, SERA-Float prevents overflow, underflow, and NaN exceptions. Our evaluation demonstrates that SERA-Float improves the reliability of floating-point operations during DNN inference by significantly reducing exceptions and ensuring the stability of computations. Moreover, it enables energy-efficient arithmetic by leveraging narrower arithmetic units, yielding up to 80.3% energy savings per multiplication with a 0.9% reduction in DNN inference accuracy."

Recent approaches typically focus exclusively on either gate cuts or wire cuts, modeling quantum circuits as graphs. However, identifying optimal cutting locations using this representation often results in prohibitively high computational complexity, especially under realistic hardware constraints. In this paper, we introduce CiFold, a novel graph-based framework that exploits repetitive modular structures inherent in quantum algorithms, significantly enhancing the scalability and efficiency of circuit cutting. Our approach systematically folds quantum circuits into compact meta-graphs by identifying and merging common gate sequences across entangled qubits, dramatically simplifying subsequent partitioning tasks. We define folding factor and variance to quantify circuit compression and ensure balanced folding. Using these condensed representations, CiFold precisely identifies cut locations without exhaustive global graph searches. We perform extensive experiments, comparing CiFold with state-of-the-art circuit-cutting techniques. Results demonstrate that CiFold achieves superior partition quality and computational efficiency, reducing the number of required cuts by an average of 31.6% and lowering the sampling overhead substantially by 3.55 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup>.

    "abstract": "Analog neuromorphic architectures using nonvolatile memory (NVM)-based crossbar arrays are a promising approach to accelerate deep learning workloads by efficiently performing the core matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs). A crossbar array leverages the current accumulation property of NVM cells to enable parallel MVM computation naturally through basic circuit laws (Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Current Law). Programming a crossbar for MVM involves mapping the synaptic weights of a deep learning model (i.e., the matrix elements) to conductance values of its NVM cells. Unfortunately, NVMs suffer from variability, including stochastic device-to-device (DDV) and cycle-to-cycle (CCV) variations in conductance-versus-pulse characteristics, which lead to imprecise weight mapping and reduced model performance.We present a novel mathematical framework to analyze the robustness of neuromorphic computing in the presence of variability in NVM. Specifically, we formulate this robustness analysis as finding the minimum perturbation in the feature space (hidden layers) that is sufficient to change the estimated output label, thereby resulting in incorrect classification. We model this as a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints, where we minimize the L2 norm squared of the perturbation subject to crossing the decision boundary to the nearest class. This results in a convex optimization problem with a quadratic objective function and linear inequality constraints. We solve the problem using Lagrangian method with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, finding the minimum perturbation as an orthogonal projection onto the closest decision boundary. The closed-form solution provides both the direction (difference of weight vectors) and magnitude (scaled by confidence difference and inverse squared norm of weight difference) of the minimum perturbation. We present an extensive analysis and evaluation of the mathematical framework on a deep neural network trained on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We also present an interpretation of the minimum perturbation, outlining the potential for algorithm-hardware co-design."

    "abstract": "The extrinsic calibration of camera systems is a common task in robotic applications. However, calibration is often performed manually, and choosing proper calibration points depends on the operator’s experience. This paper introduces a novel approach for automatically planning continuous calibration trajectories. We consider two different approaches. One is based on optimal experiment design and minimizes the width of the calibration parameters confidence intervals. The other is a heuristic approach that reduces the correlation between the calibration trajectory’s spatial components. The trajectories are based on the Fourier series, enabling repeated executions to smooth out measurement noise. To estimate the transformations in the extrinsic calibration problem, we develop a nonlinear least squares solver incorporating quaternion algebra. We evaluate the methods on an experimental setup consisting of an industrial robot, attached ArUco markers, and an RGB camera system. The real-world results confirm the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed methods, particularly in the context of optimal experiment design-based calibration trajectory planning. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by measuring the transformation from the robot base coordinate system to the coordinate system of a stationary camera. In robotics, this problem is often referred to as extrinsic camera calibration, a variant of the hand-eye calibration problem. Simultaneously, the tool’s geometry should be estimated. Here, we introduce a novel approach for automatically calibrating camera systems in robotic applications. Considering a marker attached to the robot’s tool, we plan its motion to ensure accurate extrinsic calibration. We developed two methods: one based on an a priori geometric model—e.g., obtained from a CAD planning model—and a heuristic approach that requires little prior information. The planned continuous trajectory consists of periodic functions that consider the Cartesian position, velocity, and acceleration limits regarding the robot’s tool frame. The periodicity enables us to repeat the trajectory multiple times, reducing the influence of measurement errors. We additionally implemented a fast and robust solver to estimate the tool geometry and the transformation from the robot’s base frame to the camera coordinate system, using measurements of the robot’s flange pose and the marker pose detected by the camera system. The approach is evaluated on an experimental setup with an industrial robot and an RGB camera. The results prove the superiority of the model-based planner, while the heuristic planner still provides reasonable results. The calculated confidence intervals provide an estimate of the accuracy of the calibration parameters."

Point-based neural rendering (PBNR) offers a photorealistic and efficient alternative to conventional methods, yet it is still challenging to achieve real-time rendering on mobile platforms. We pinpoint two major bottlenecks in PBNR pipelines: LoD search and splatting. LoD search suffers from workload imbalance and irregular memory access, making it inefficient on off-the-shelf GPUs. Meanwhile, splatting introduces severe warp divergence across GPU threads due to its inherent sparsity.To tackle these challenges, we propose SLTarch, an algorithm-architecture co-designed framework. At its core, SLTarch introduces SLTree, a dedicated subtree-based data structure, and LTcore, a specialized hardware architecture tailored for efficient LoD search. Additionally, we co-design a divergence-free splatting algorithm with our simple yet principled hardware augmentation, SPcore, to existing PBNR accelerators. Compared to a mobile GPU, SLTarch achieves 3.9× speedup and 98% energy savings with negligible architecture overhead. Compared to existing accelerator designs, SLTarch achieves 1.8× speedup with 54% energy savings."

During the routing process, the crosstalk effect is usually modeled by predicting coupling capacitance with congestion information. However, such estimations are often overly pessimistic, as crosstalk-induced delay is influenced not only by coupling capacitance but also by the relative arrival times of signals. In this work, we propose ChronoTE, a novel edge-enhanced graph neural network (GNN) framework that performs crosstalk-aware net delay estimation by jointly modeling physical topology and timing characteristics. By embedding timing-window-aware features into edge representations, ChronoTE enables accurate delay prediction without requiring full routing or parasitic extraction. Experimental results on industrial-scale open-source designs demonstrate that ChronoTE, by delivering sign-off quality delay estimation in the early global routing stage, significantly accelerates design closure and contributes to area reduction."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a real-time sound source localization system for Microsoft HoloLens 2, which aims to enhance spatial awareness through mixed reality feedback. The architecture follows a client-server model in which audio signals, captured by the built-in microphone array of Microsoft HoloLens 2, are preprocessed locally and sent to a remote Python server for inference using a machine learning model deployed in Google Vertex AI. The predicted sound direction is visualized directly in the user’s field of view through mixed reality cues, enabling intuitive spatial orientation without requiring external hardware. To assess system performance, we conducted a controlled experiment measuring response times under different combinations of server hardware and network configurations. Results demonstrate the feasibility of real-time audio-based localization in mixed reality and suggest that the system can be extended with multimodal feedback for more effective navigation in complex acoustic environments."

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for computer vision tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global contextual relationships. However, their substantial compute and memory demands hinder efficient deployment in scenarios with strict energy and bandwidth limitations. In this work, we propose Opto-ViT, the first near-sensor, region-aware ViT accelerator leveraging silicon photonics (SiPh) for real-time and energy-efficient vision processing. Opto-ViT features a hybrid electronic-photonic architecture, where the optical core handles compute-intensive matrix multiplications using Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) and Microring Resonators (MRs), while nonlinear functions and normalization are executed electronically. To reduce redundant computation and patch processing, we introduce a lightweight Mask Generation Network (MGNet) that identifies regions of interest in the current frame and prunes irrelevant patches before ViT encoding. We further co-optimize the ViT backbone using quantization-aware training and matrix decomposition tailored for photonic constraints. Experiments across device fabrication, circuit and architecture co-design, to classification, detection, and video tasks demonstrate that Opto-ViT achieves 100.4 KFPS/W with up to 84% energy savings with less than 1.6% accuracy loss, while enabling scalable and efficient ViT deployment at the edge."

    "abstract": "Sparse matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a critical kernel used in a wide range of applications, but irregular memory access patterns and memory bandwidth bottleneck as well as load imbalance make the efficient and scalable processing on parallel architectures a significant challenge. Motivated by the memory-bound nature of SpMM computation, we propose a cost-effective SpMM accelerator based on a DRAM processing-in-memory (PIM) approach. Our design introduces a novel dataflow to exploit high bank-level parallelism and reuse both input and output data even for highly sparse matrices. Our proposed architecture, SPIMA, features multiple input buffers for scheduling DRAM access, a output buffer and vector register files working holistically, co-designed to maximize the performance of our novel dataflow. Our experimental results using various sparse matrices demonstrate that our proposed dataflow and architecture are robust in terms of matrix size and sparsity. Compared with the state-of-the-art accelerators implemented on PIM, ASIC, and FPGA, we estimate that our PIM architecture can yield competitive performance with highly sparse matrices."

    "abstract": "Genetic algorithms can tackle many problems that are otherwise intractable, yet their most notable drawback is the lengthy time needed to converge. This paper investigates how GPU acceleration can address this challenge and reduce the time genetic algorithms require to produce a solution. Using the Traveling Salesman Problem as a case study, we isolate the two most expensive stages, construction of the distance matrix and per-tour fitness evaluation, and port them to CUDA. We then introduce two kernel-level optimizations for the distance matrix computation. Shared memory tiling caches column coordinates on the chip, cutting global memory traffic and shrinking distance matrix time by 38.7%. Then, multistream execution with pinned host memory overlaps data transfers with computation, trimming end-to-end matrix build time by 28.5%. The fitness function, when ported to the GPU, achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup for medium-sized instances and almost doubles performance for larger cases, compared to the CPU baseline. All experiments were conducted on an Intel Xeon CPU and an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU, using randomly generated datasets ranging in size from 100 to 10,000 locations.The proposed techniques generalize to any evolutionary or swarm method whose fitness decomposes into pairwise calculations, offering a practical recipe for scaling population-based optimizers on modern GPUs."

We provide a numerical stability analysis, methods for parameter selection and infeasibility detection. The algorithm is implemented in c with efficient linear algebra packages to provide a short execution time and allows calling superADMM from popular languages such as MATLAB and Python. A comparison of superADMM with state-of-the-art ADMM solvers and widely used commercial solvers showcases the efficiency and accuracy of the developed solver."

The system is designed to provide precise lens positioning by following the user’s eye movements, enabling accurate retinal imaging in compact, wearable ophthalmic devices based on smartphone cameras. A comprehensive state-space model is developed to describe the mechanical and electrical dynamics of the system, which includes two DC motors operating along orthogonal axes. Two control strategies are investigated: a classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and a data-driven Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on simulated system responses. The MLP receives the system state deviation as input and outputs control signals approximating optimal behavior. Simulation results using a pupil trajectory demonstrate that both controllers achieve accurate tracking, with the MLP showing improved adaptability under model uncertainty. The neural network achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.1089 compared to 0.1557 with LQR. This research supports the development of cost-effective, sensorless, and adaptive control systems suitable for remote ophthalmic diagnostics in telemedicine, particularly in resource-constrained environments."

    "abstract": "The ability to rapidly acquire novel visuomotor skills is essential for daily functioning tasks such as motor rehabilitation, surgical operation, and mechanical assembly. Previous research suggested that experiencing flow can enhance learning outcomes. Although dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) has been commonly used to induce flow and maximize engagement, most existing methods rely on model-free, stepwise adaptations that lack quantitative, model-based support. In this study, we proposed a personalized, model-driven DDA approach to facilitate visuomotor skill acquisition by enhancing flow during the learning process. We implemented an adaptive fine fingertip force control task with DDA based on optimal control principles to train the visuomotor skills. This DDA updated task difficultly using real-time multiple performance metrics, with parameters derived from an individually fitted model that captures each user's motor behavior during the task. A user study, involving two groups, compared the effects of a model-driven adaptive task with a model-free control task. Results from the flow state scale and physiological recordings demonstrated that the model-driven task elicited significantly higher levels of flow than the model-free task. Moreover, participants in the model-driven group showed a notably higher learning rate in visuomotor skills (19%) compared to the model-free group (8%). These findings underscore the potential of integrating personalized modeling and optimal control theory to optimize user experience and accelerate learning outcomes in DDA frameworks when building adaptive human–machine interaction systems."

    "abstract": "Understanding how people perceive visualizations is crucial for designing effective visual data representations; however, many heuristic design guidelines are derived from specific tasks or visualization types, without considering the constraints or conditions under which those guidelines hold. In this work, we aimed to assess existing design heuristics for categorical visualization using well-established psychological knowledge. Specifically, we examine the impact of the subitizing phenomenon in cognitive psychology- people's ability to automatically recognize a small set of objects instantly without counting-in data visualizations. We conducted three experiments with multi-class scatterplots-between 2 and 15 classes with varying design choices-across three different tasks-class estimation, correlation comparison, and clustering judgments-to understand how performance changes as the number of classes (and therefore set size) increases. Our results indicate if the category number is smaller than six, people tend to perform well at all tasks, providing empirical evidence of subitizing in visualization. When category numbers increased, performance fell, with the magnitude of the performance change depending on task and encoding. Our study bridges the gap between heuristic guidelines and empirical evidence by applying well-established psychological theories, suggesting future opportunities for using psychological theories and constructs to characterize visualization perception."

    "abstract": "Lane change is one of the basic and pivotal behaviors in autonomous vehicle driving that affects driving efficiency and safety. However, current lane change strategies lack the ability of timely adjustment and flexible decision making in response to the mixed traffic environment where autonomous and human-driven vehicles coexist. To address the issue, this article proposes a two-level decision-making strategy comprising an upper lane selection layer and a lower-trajectory learning layer for automatic lane change, which incorporate human driving experiences to achieve humanlike performance. The upper lane selection layer refrains from predefined driving styles but utilizes a convolutional neural network–bidirectional gated recurrent unit (CNN-BiGRU) network to capture the driving styles of both the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles. This layer selects the optimal lane by comprehensively considering the driving styles and traffic impact factors in the current scenario. The lower-trajectory learning layer’s trajectory generation module optimizes candidate trajectories based on the selected lane from the upper layer. The lane selection employs maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL) through maximizing the cumulative reward, enhancing the probability of selecting humanlike trajectories. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively learn a humanlike lane-changing strategy, which improves vehicle adaptability in complex traffic environments. The proposed method achieves 95.42% accuracy of lane selection and 0.788 human similarity of trajectory imitation."

Building upon previous work that demonstrated 3D open-loop position control by leveraging the opposing dipole moment created from induced eddy currents, this work demonstrates closed-loop position control of a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere in lab tests, and the efficacy of varying methods for force inversion is explored. The closed-loop methods represent a critical first step towards wider applications for 3-DOF position control of induced magnetic dipoles."

This paper presents a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF)-based approach for SOC estimation and fractional-order battery model parameter identification, with the aim of improving estimation accuracy. A multi-time scale fractional-order adaptive Kalman filter framework is developed for online identification of battery internal parameters and SOC estimation. Within this framework, an event-triggered CKF scheme updates fast dynamic parameters at each time step, while slow dynamic parameters are updated only when SOC variations exceed a predefined threshold. An adaptive CKF integrated with variational Bayesian inference is employed to mitigate noise effects on SOC estimation. Furthermore, a neural network compensation mechanism is proposed to refine the SOC estimation. Specifically, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) combined with a sliding window strategy corrects the SOC obtained from the adaptive CKF, and the corrected SOC is fed back into the identification loop to improve parameter estimation accuracy. Experimental results under various operating conditions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in SOC estimation accuracy, even in scenarios where the neural network has not been trained."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by blood entering the media layer of the aortic vessel wall. This creates a second flow channel, known as the false lumen, which weakens the aortic wall and can potentially lead to fatal aortic rupture. Current risk stratification of aortic dissections is primarily based on morphological features of the aorta. However, hemodynamics also play a significant role in disease progression, though their investigation and visualization remain challenging. Common flow visualizations often experience visual clutter, especially when dealing with the intricate morphologies of aortic dissections. In this work, we implement and evaluate different approaches to visualizing the flow in aortic dissections effectively. We employ three techniques, namely streaklines with depth-dependent halos, transparent streaklines, and smoke surfaces. The latter is a technique based on streak surfaces, enhanced with opacity modulations, to produce a smoke-like appearance that improves visual clarity. We adapt the original opacity modulation of smoke surfaces to visualize flow even within the complex geometries of aortic dissections, thereby enhancing visual fidelity. To effectively capture dissection hemodynamics, we developed customized seeding structures that adapt to the shape of the surrounding lumen. Our evaluation, conducted via an online questionnaire, included medical professionals, fluid simulation experts, and visualization specialists. By analyzing results across these groups, we highlight differences in preference and interpretability, offering insight into domain-specific needs. No single visualization technique emerged as the best overall. Smoke surfaces provide the best overall clarity and visual realism. However, participants found streaklines with halos to be the best for quantifying flow, dispite them introducing significant visual clutter. Transparent streaklines serve as a middle ground, offering improved clarity over halos while maintaining some level of detail. Across all participant groups, smoke surfaces were rated as the most visually appealing and lifelike, with medical professionals highlighting their resemblance to contrast-agent injections used in clinical practice."

While many approaches have been proposed to classify fine-grained images, some overlook the correlation between region localization and fine-grained feature learning, neglecting the opportunity for these processes to enhance one another. In this study, we introduce an architecture that integrates a patch-wise feature representation strategy to simultaneously improve discriminative region localization and enhance local feature representation. In the patch-wise feature representation module, we apply hyperbolic tangent activation on the patch-wise feature map to prevent potential dominant responses. Specifically, our approach generates a patch-wise loss-guided feature map that effectively emphasizes localized regions. This feature map is fused with global feature representations, yielding a comprehensive integrated feature descriptor that combines localized discriminative details with overall fine-grained context. Extensive experimental evaluations across several standard fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed architecture consistently achieves better performance compared to several existing state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our patch-wise and global feature integration strategy."

To protect image privacy on the cloud and IoT application scenarios, this paper first presents an efficient PSS scheme through the integration of two deep learning networks and reversible data hiding in encrypted images. After sharing different parts of the original image, the receiver can progressively recover: a low-resolution image, a mask image where the most sensitive area is peeled off, and the original image according to the number of holding shares and image encryption keys. Some additional data such as signatures, fingerprints, and timestamps can be also embedded into each share on the cloud server, as the data extraction is separate from image recovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can uniquely and efficiently obtain a recovered image progressively. Our scheme also has a higher security level, and the average embedding rate achieves almost a 1 bpp improvement compared to state-of-the-art schemes on a larger-scale image dataset."

This study introduces a multi-agent conversational system designed under the Design Science Research paradigm, which is instantiated through three artifacts. First artifact is a data processing system that integrates procurement and legislative records through classification, region detection, and OCR. A second artifact is a set of specialized agents, combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation for attendance and voting with a Text-to-SQL agent for procurement. The third artifact is a multi-agent orchestration system that unifies these components within a microservices architecture. Together, they transform raw governmental records into structured, auditable, and citizen-accessible responses. The pipeline achieved strong results: classifiers reached accuracies up to 0.989, YOLOv11 obtained mAP@50–95 of 0.965 for attendance and 0.886 for voting, and Tesseract delivered a character error rate of 0.031 and word error rate of 0.078. The RAG agents achieved MAP of 0.950 for attendance and 0.926 for voting, confirming robust retrieval even under noisy conditions. For procurement queries, the Text-to-SQL agent outperformed baselines with FLEX of 0.909 and EX of 0.801. End-to-end evaluation confirmed reliability with Faithfulness of 0.942, Answer Relevancy of 0.907, Answer Similarity of 0.984, and Answer Correctness of 0.891, complemented by BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE metrics.

The system was trained on a balanced dataset and enhanced with domain-specific data augmentation to improve generalization. Internal evaluation achieved classification accuracies of 97% for spirals and 93% for waves.

    "abstract": "Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems. cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs), transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS), while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring power budgets."

    "abstract": "In the contemporary digital era, the necessity for swift and reliable diagnostic tools in medical imaging has become increasingly paramount. However, brain magnetic resonance imaging analysis poses significant challenges, including high intraclass variability, low interclass contrast, and the need for expert annotation. This study presents the development of an intelligent diagnostic system based on a custom Convolutional Neural Network architecture, specifically designed to assist in the detection and classification of brain tumors. The system processes magnetic resonance images to distinguish between glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy brain tissue. The proposed model was trained and evaluated on a benchmark dataset and compared with several established architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the custom architecture achieves comparable classification accuracy while showing increased computational efficiency, offering a promising tool to support clinicians with fast, interpretable, and robust diagnostic predictions. Furthermore, the results highlight important considerations for selecting specific types of layers, a process substantiated by mathematical arguments presented throughout the paper."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Resistive RAM (RRAM) based Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architectures highlight significant potential for accelerating data-intensive computing tasks. However, non-idealities in RRAM devices, such as variability, result in small sensing margins that can significantly affect the computational efficiency. This issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with complex multi-operand logic operations. This paper introduces a circuit-level scheme for CIM-based multi-operand XOR logic operations, leveraging a Voltage-To-Time converter (VTC) to perform multi-phased XORs in a single clock cycle. In this approach, we exploit bitline capacitances for voltage-based sensing during computation, generating an output voltage that is linearly proportional to the operand values. This voltage is then converted into the desired logic output using the VTC design. Furthermore, low-power techniques are employed in the deployment of sense amplifiers, such as regulating power consumption during operation and disabling the amplifiers once the decision is made. Simulation results for a post-layout extracted 512x512 (256Kb) RRAM-based CIM array show that up to 16-operand XOR operation can be accurately and reliably performed as opposed to a maximum of three operands supported by state-of-the-art solutions, while offering up to 49× better figure-of-merit combining energy-efficiency and throughput."

BitMedVit utilizes ternary-quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and combines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BitMedVit employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BitMedVit achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43×, memory traffic by 39×, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41× that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano.

As a specific type of ONoCs, wavelength-routed ONoCs (WRONoCs) offer exclusive benefits such as collision-free and arbitration-free communication between cores. To guide the design and optimization of WRONoCs, many simulators have been developed to model WRONoC behavior at the device and circuit levels, offering detailed insights into photonic components. These tools have significantly advanced photonic design. As WRONoCs move closer to practical applications, network-level simulation becomes increasingly important for evaluating end-to-end communication behavior. Despite the need, existing simulators rarely support WRONoC modeling at the network level, leaving a critical gap in current toolchains. To address that, we propose the first network-level WRONoC simulation platform, WROXIM, adapted from an open-source NoC simulator, Noxim. It supports cycle-accurate modeling of optical communication behaviors and retains full compatibility with traditional electrical NoC simulations. To model realistic communication behaviors, WROXIM incorporates both optical and electrical components, including serializers, deserializers, waveguides, buffers, and processing elements (PEs). This modeling approach allows the simulator to capture end-to-end data movement from a PE through the optical interconnect to another PE. Given an application with multiple tasks, WROXIM supports task-driven workloads and provides key performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and energy consumption, offering a platform for design exploration and verification for WRONoCs."

    "abstract": "Transformers have increasingly become the backbone of modern AI, excelling in tasks across natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Despite their effectiveness, calculating them is costly, especially on source-constrained platforms like FPGAs. Among the three main computation modules in a Transformer model (QKV generation, attention computation, FFN), most prior research has primarily focused on the attention computation. However, it is typically the QKV generation and the FFN that dominate the overall computational cost in most cases. To address this gap, we propose SiST, an innovative algorithm-architecture co-design to optimize all three modules of Transformer with both sparsity and token similarity. We first propose a cross-stage sparsity prediction mechanism before QKV generation to minimize computations involved in both QKV generation and attention computing. The prediction mechanism avoids large overhead through off-line weight clustering. Further, we leverage token similarity to adapt token clustering in FFN module, thereby reducing computational load. Moreover, the sparsity of weights in FFN is explored to further optimize the computational load. Our dedicated hardware architecture can effectively handle the unstructured sparsity and token clustering, ensuring high hardware resource utilization. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SiST reduces computational overhead by 45.9% to 52.2% with less than 2% loss in accuracy. It achieves a 2.35× to 8.44× speedup, 1.50× to 14.09× normalized throughput improvement and 2.43× to 3.44× improvement in energy efficiency compared with other FPGA-based Transformer accelerators."

Previous methods have attempted to build multiple electrostatic systems for different fence region types to manage this issue. However, these approaches fail to handle situations where instances from different fence region types are allowed to be placed within the same region for a specific type of fence region constraint. To overcome these limitations, we propose generating General electrostatic system that eliminates overlaps between instances across isolated electrostatic systems while minimizing disruptions to the placement result. Additionally, instances assigned to a fence region may initially be displaced from their designated placeable regions due to wirelength forces, requiring extra time and effort to reposition them. To address this issue, we develop a resistive force formulation based on a non-Newtonian fluid model and integrate it into the analytical framework to enhance both convergence stability and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, achieving an 11-14% reduction in iteration count compared to MORPH and DREAMPlace 3.0 on academic benchmarks, and a 7.8x reduction in runtime compared to Innovus on industrial benchmarks."

The main focus is on studying ERP P600 latency related to speech processing. The study included speech and tonal stimuli of varying duration applied to healthy participants without hearing impairments. The main tasks were to evaluate the effect of the duration of speech stimuli, the type of speech stimuli on the characteristics of the $\\mathbf{P 3 0 0}$, as well as to compare the characteristics of the P300 in response to tonal stimuli and speech stimuli. The study was conducted using an electroencephalograph and a developed auditory stimulation board, on which speech and sound files in wav format were recorded. The results showed that the ERP P300 delay in response to speech stimuli averaged $\\mathbf{4 8 0 - 5 3 0 ~ m s}$, while for tonal stimuli it ranged from $330-350 \\mathrm{~ms}$. In addition, the amplitude of responses to speech stimuli was lower in the range of $\\mathbf{6. 5 - 9. 8 ~ M v}$ compared with tonal stimuli in the range of $9.7-11.0 \\mathrm{MV}$.

This survey presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning models and, for the first time, offers a categorization of advanced architectures from the perspective of data representations. EMG, as a distinctive biosignal modality, can be characterized through multiple representational forms, including temporal waveforms, spatial images, spectral domains, and graph-based structures comprising interconnected nodes. Consequently, the optimal model architecture is closely tied to the specific data representation employed. In addition, the limited availability of EMG datasets, particularly those with high-quality labels, remains a critical bottleneck and continues to impede the translation of research advances into widespread real-world applications. We therefore examine emerging semi-supervised and self-supervised learning frameworks, which serve as complementary approaches to fully supervised paradigms. Finally, we outline promising future directions for the development of generalizable and robust deep learning for practical EMG decoding."

Previous studies on automatic optical routing have typically assumed uniform waveguide classes, neglecting the real-world requirement for multiple waveguide types to enhance performance and integration density. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive waveguide routing framework explicitly tailored for PICs that effectively handles hybrid waveguide classes. Our method starts with a fast initial routing algorithm that optimizes waveguide paths, considering target net lengths or length matching constraints among nets, minimizing bends, and ensuring compatibility with hybrid waveguide usage. We further enhance routing quality using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based automatic transition insertion technique, strategically employing different waveguide types to significantly reduce transmission loss and ensure compliance with stringent matching constraints. Experimental results show that, compared to prior approaches, our algorithm reduces total insertion loss by up to 37% on average in target-length routing scenarios, and achieves an average reduction of 5% in total insertion loss and 14% in maximum loss in multi-net cases while satisfying all constraints."

However, progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computers is limited by low qubit counts and considerable gate errors. A promising direction involves transitioning from two-level qubits to d-level qudits, expanding the state space beyond conventional qubit-based quantum computers. The superconducting transmon-tunable coupler-transmon (TTT) system has emerged as a key building block of current quantum processors. Recent demonstration has shown its capability to host three-level qudits (qutrits), including the implementation of qutrit controlled-phase (CPhase) gate via an adiabatic scheme. Despite this progress, further modeling or optimization studies for the qudit-based TTT system are still unexplored. In this work, we propose an integrated simulation framework that predicts the cross-Kerr interactions of the TTT system and the fidelities of two-qutrit CPhase gate with the presence of noise effect. We validate the prediction of the cross-Kerr interactions against data from TTT systems reported in the literature. We also identify the conditions for the maximum target frequency in the adiabatic scheme necessary to achieve higher qutrit CPhase gate fidelity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the control-device co-optimization of the system, showing the potential of achieving the highest gate fidelity allowed by the hardware and noise. This work provides valuable insights which can guide the development towards more reliable and powerful superconducting quantum processors."

    "abstract": "Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency, and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13× speedup and 4× lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Deep carbonate sedimentary cycle division is a core geological theory for analyzing sedimentary environments and provides important guidance for predicting the distribution of high-quality reservoirs. As a key technique, time-frequency (TF) analysis primarily focuses on the high-resolution characterization of dominant frequency variations caused by changes in stratum thickness. To enhance TF resolution, this study proposes a matching extracting transform (MET) to better characterize sedimentary cycles. Initially, the method constructs a matching chirp rate estimator (MC), leveraging the relationship between the instantaneous frequency (IF) estimator and the group delay estimator within the short-time Fourier transform domain, to capture the slope of the IF trajectory. Subsequently, based on the properties of the MC, a chirp rate valid domain (CVD) for the MC is defined to constrain its computational interval. Within this CVD, a maximum criterion under the chirp transform is then employed to extract the signal’s IF trajectory accurately. Finally, the TF coefficients are reassigned along the retrieved IF trajectory, enhancing TF energy concentration while maintaining signal reconstruction fidelity, as validated numerically. Applications to both simulated sedimentary cycle models and field deep carbonate seismic data demonstrate that the proposed MET is a potential tool for sedimentary cycle division."

    "abstract": "Dense point clouds significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy of intricate printed circuit board (PCB) components. However, the density of point cloud is inherently limited by camera resolution. While high-resolution cameras enhance detail capture, they substantially increase hardware costs and introduce additional image noise. To address these challenges, a three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction method of fringe structured light based on phase field super-resolution is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an edge phase extraction method is developed based on the phase field’s distribution characteristics. This method employs bidirectional search windows (horizontal and vertical orientations) to extract missing phase regions, effectively mitigating the errors induced by edge phase discontinuities. Secondly, to address the inherent limitations of sparse point cloud in reconstructing micro-object morphology, a phase super-resolution algorithm based on improved polynomials and splines to construct high-resolution phase field. Accordingly, the dense point cloud with more detail can be obtained. The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved significantly higher measurement accuracy (31.69% reduction in mean absolute error-MAE) and better stability (25.65% reduction in root mean squared error-RMSE). Compared with conventional image super-resolution methods, the proposed method demonstrates superior measurement accuracy and stability for micro-components, which further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Feature selection accelerates training, enhances interpretability, and reduces data dimensionality by identifying the most relevant and important features, thereby improving machine learning performance. However, current quantum feature selection methods are still in their early stages and predominantly focus on linear relationships within the data. This limitation overlooks potential nonlinear relationships, preventing the selection of the most representative feature subset. Consequently, this shortcoming can degrade the performance of subsequent learning tasks, especially on nonlinear datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Intertwine, a nonlinear quantum feature selection method with multi-kernel circuits. Specifically, we design a quantum multi-kernel circuit that independently maps each feature, enabling the extraction of multiple kernel matrices. This process maps all features into the quantum kernel space, where the original nonlinear relationships become linearly separable, effectively capturing the inherent nonlinear structure in the data. We then construct a nonlinear feature selection objective function by incorporating class labels, kernel matrices, and orthogonality constraints to guide the selection process. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of Intertwine on both synthetic and public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Intertwine outperforms state-of-the-art quantum feature selection methods, achieving an average improvement of 4.60% in classification accuracy. The source code for the proposed Intertwine method is publicly available at https://github.com/xhchangsha/quantum-feature-selection."

In experiment, we model the practical noise sources of shot, dark, and read noise of the measurement spectrometer and calculate the Cramér-Rao Bound in the presence of these noises.

    "abstract": "Knowledge transfer aims to apply existing knowledge to different tasks or new data, and it has extensive applications in multi-domain and Multi-Task Learning. The key to this task is quickly identifying a fine-grained object for knowledge sharing and efficiently transferring knowledge. Current methods, such as fine-tuning, layer-wise parameter sharing, and task-specific adapters, only offer coarse-grained sharing solutions and struggle to effectively search for shared parameters, thus hindering the performance and efficiency of knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose Channel-Wise Parameter Sharing (CWPS), a novel fine-grained parameter-sharing method for knowledge transfer, which is efficient for parameter sharing, comprehensive, and plug-and-play. For the coarse-grained problem, we first achieve fine-grained parameter sharing by refining the granularity of shared parameters from the level of layers to the level of neurons. The knowledge learned from previous tasks can be utilized through the explicit composition of the model neurons. Besides, we promote an effective search strategy to minimize computational costs, simplifying the selection of shared weights. In addition, our CWPS has strong composability and generalization ability, which theoretically can be applied to any network consisting of linear and convolution layers. We introduce several datasets in both Incremental Learning and Multi-Task Learning scenarios. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art precision-to-parameter ratio performance with various backbones, demonstrating its efficiency and versatility."

Change in impedance is consistent with a time-scale-free power law, as measured following both (i) 1-day and (ii) 56 day breaks in cycling. In our experiments, the impedance change decays slowly back to baseline, conforming approximately to a power law. However, an exponential relationship cannot be ruled-out. Small relative changes of around 2% are still evident up to 32 days after a 56 day break in cycling. The magnitude of the history-dependent change in impedance is smaller than that due to changes in stimulating waveform, and thus history-dependent effects may be masked in many practical applications. In conclusion, long-term effects of history can be exemplified by a careful choice of experiment, implying that measurements such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy should be carried out after relaxation periods longer than previously used (greater than two days). However, in practical applications such as electric vehicles the effect may well be masked by the variability in applied waveforms and temperature fluctuations, and be of limited practical consequence."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective method for enhancing large language models by integrating external knowledge sources to reduce the model size, avoid hallucinations, and provide an easier way to update the knowledge than fine-tuning. This external knowledge is commonly managed by vector databases, where the external knowledge is embedded into vectors and retrieved with vector similarity search. As the size of these external knowledge bases grows, the memory requirements for storing vectors and their associated indexes exceed the practical limits of main memory, prompting a shift toward storage-based solutions. Despite the adoption of storage-based solutions in modern vector databases, there have been limited systematic evaluations of the performance characteristics and I/O behavior of state-of-the-practice vector databases with storage-based setups. In this paper, we systematically characterize the performance, scalability, and I/O characteristics of these vector databases on modern SSDs that can deliver millions of I/O operations/s with less than 100 μs latency. We report 22 observations and 3 key findings that indicate: (i) vector databases with storage-based setups do not necessarily indicate lower performance than memory-based setups, for example, the storage-based setup DiskANN outperforms the memory-based setup, IVF, with up to 3.2× search throughput in Milvus, (ii) state-of-the-practice vector databases with storage-based setups require optimizations on I/O traffic to fully utilize the performance with flash SSDs, the maximum bandwidth achieved in our experiments is 1.7 GiB/s and can not saturate our benchmarked SSD, and (iii) the indexes’ search-time parameters affect both performance and I/O characteristics of vector databases, for example, when the parameter search_list increases from 10 to 100, the throughput of vector similarity search decreases up to 60.9% and the read bandwidth increases up to 3.3×.

For example, it takes 25 minutes to re-generate a parasitic netlist for a mere layer thickness change using existing commercial tools. This runtime becomes the bottleneck for standard cell DTCO. In this work, we demonstrate a machine-learning-based method targeted on standard cells that can efficiently extract parasitic capacitance within seconds while maintaining competitive error distribution compared to the state-of-the-art rule-based 2.5D extraction method, which suffers from pattern mismatch since no real layout is provided at the pre-characterization stage.

However, costly Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) makes efficient and flexible hardware design extremely challenging, particularly for ASIC/FPGA-based hardware acceleration solutions that often struggle with high resource consumption and low computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight reconfigurable polynomial multiplication accelerator for NTT termed RePM. The hardware architecture adheres to the principles that are applicable to various post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms and operates under very strict power constraints. A conflict-free near-memory mapping scheme is adopted to reconstruct the computation topology, significantly reducing the frequency of data relocation. Moreover, this work pioneers an elastic computing array architecture for butterfly units that eliminates pre-computing requirements. By integrating the mixed radix-2/4 NTT algorithms proposed in this paper, we eliminate both pre-processing and post-processing stages in the computational workflow. This innovation achieves a 2.1 × acceleration in ML-KEM (i.e. CRYSTALS-Kyber) execution speed with ML-KEM-512/1024, positioning it as a leading implementation of NIST’s fourth-round post-quantum cryptography standard. Experimental results demonstrate that this architecture achieves up to 75% power reduction and 65.8% improvement in area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art solutions, while preserving a 17× higher computational throughput under strict power constraints."

This paper proposes an LLM-augmented multi-modal fusion method that captures this dual nature of microarchitecture design. By recombining design parameters with their natural language descriptors, we leverage a domain-knowledge-enhanced LLM to extract semantic features that represent functional behavior. Simultaneously, we process Chisel-compiled RTL through a graph neural network to capture structural implementation details. This multi-modal approach enables more effective feature extraction from limited evaluation data. We integrate these rich features into an MLP enhanced with Monte Carlo dropout. This approach provides uncertainty quantification while enabling end-to-end training, allowing the pre-trained feature extractors to be fine-tuned during exploration through Bayesian optimization. Experimental results and ablation studies on a Gemmini-based RISC-V SoC demonstrate that our approach significantly improves exploration efficiency and prediction quality under data limitations."

Second, a data-reuse multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) scheme for mantissa is designed to further optimize MM, which shares partial operation result to reduce redundant computation. The SOT-MRAM and SRAM based CIM architectures with dynamic sparsity and data-reuse schemes are constructed to perform weight (Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V)) and dynamic MM, respectively.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of flexible electronics (FE) has driven significant innovation across diverse sectors, including healthcare, wearables, smart packaging, and IoT devices, owing to their adaptability, lightweight form factor, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional silicon-based electronics. A key computing paradigm in this domain is bespoke classifiers, where model parameters are hardcoded in neuromorphic hardware to meet strict area, power, and cost constraints. By tailoring bespoke hardware to specific tasks, these circuits achieve significant accuracy under tight resource budgets but also introduce distinct security vulnerabilities. The intrinsic flexibility of substrates, unconventional manufacturing processes, and limited protective packaging make such systems particularly vulnerable to security threats, with side-channel attacks (SCAs) being a critical concern. In this work, we systematically investigate SCA vulnerabilities in bespoke TFT-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers, considering both analog (flexible analog multilayer perceptron (f-AMLP)) and digital (flexible digital multilayer perceptron (f-DMLP)) realizations. For digital classifiers, we apply correlation power analysis (CPA), leveraging well-established leakage models from silicon-based systems. For analog classifiers, where leakage is continuous, nonlinear, and strongly influenced by device-level variability, we develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN)-based regression attack capable of extracting inputs from noisy power traces. Experimental results across benchmark datasets show that f-DMLPs can be compromised with 70–85% cumulative attack success rate (ASR) after ≈ 4k–5k traces using CPA, while f-AMLPs, though slower to attack initially, reach up to 90–95% ASR after ≈ 8k–9k traces with CNN-based approach."

    "abstract": "Transformable robots adapt to various environments by changing their shape or functionality. The robots are able to further expand their task range by replacing their end-effectors (EEs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive-limb transformable robot capable of replacing multiple types of mounted EEs. First, 7 degrees of freedom (DoF) limbs can reach multiple types of EEs mounted on the front body surface, and replace them using that single limb without relying on external devices. Second, we develop a compact Lock-Spin mechanism that integrates a locking mechanism into the rotor of the motor to enable continuous rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transformable robot can replace EEs on-site and that this replacement enables locomotion and manipulation adapted to the environment. Transformable robots have potential applications in disaster rescue and other fields since they adapt to various environments by changing shape or functions. To enhance environmental adaptability, robots are able to handle diverse tasks by replacing their end-effectors. Robots require different functionalities depending on the environment. Conventional mobile robots and manipulator arms, which are fixed in a single configuration, are limited to a narrow range of environments. By contrast, transformable robots adapt to diverse settings by reconfiguring their shape and functionality for different task modes. These robots are expected to operate flexibly in harsh environments such as disaster sites and uneven terrain."

    "abstract": "Accurate image-based geographical positioning faces significant challenges under low-light conditions where image degradation severely impacts positioning accuracy. While extensive research exists for normal lighting scenarios, the impact of insufficient illumination on geolocation performance remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel framework that integrates CLIP visual-language models with low-light enhancement techniques, featuring an adaptive decision mechanism that dynamically selects optimal processing strategies based on image quality assessment. Our methodology contributes: (1) systematic quantification of low-light impacts on geolocation accuracy; (2) intelligent integration of image enhancement with positioning models; (3) development of a computationally efficient selection mechanism. Experimental results on approximately 50,000 low-light images demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over conventional methods, with our Transformer-based approach achieving 63.72% accuracy at 2500km threshold compared to 60.66% baseline. The framework maintains practical computational efficiency while providing robust performance across varying illumination conditions. This work fills a critical research gap in low-light geolocation and offers practical solutions for real-world applications requiring 24/7 positioning capabilities."

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of MEMS gyroscopes, enhancing their performance has become crucial. Although meticulous design efforts have been made, mode mismatching caused by material imperfections and manufacturing limitations typically results in significant degradation of mechanical sensitivity. To address this challenge, this study proposes a real-time mode matching method for gyroscopes without external disturbance signals. The proposed approach acquires frequency difference information by observing internal system parameters, thereby avoiding the interference to the system’s dynamic characteristics that is inherent in conventional active disturbance methods. Notable features include non-intrusive detection, high robustness, and exceptional compatibility. Experimental results on the ring gyroscope show that the bias instability and angle random walk are improved by factors of 4 and 3, respectively. The scale factor temperature sensitivity is reduced by 14 times. This methodology effectively enhances gyroscope performance and establishes a novel pathway for real-time mode matching in MEMS gyroscopes."

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, posing serious challenges to their deployment in security-critical applications. Existing defense strategies improve robustness but at the cost of significant computational overhead, limiting their practicality. To address this, we propose STEM, a lightweight and parallelizable token pruning defense mechanism that enhances robustness while reducing inference cost. STEM integrates two components: Block-wise Selective Fusion (BSF), which fuses redundant tokens and flags suspicious ones, and Identify-Prune (IP), which identifies and prunes adversarial tokens based on multi-head attention statistics.To support STEM efficiently in hardware, we further design STEMA, a scalable accelerator featuring a dedicated Security Core operating in parallel with the ViT backbone. STEMA includes specialized engines for token fusion, top-k selection, and metadata management, occupying only 5% of chip area.Experimental results show that STEM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense performance and demonstrates excellent efficiency. Specifically, STEM improves robustness by up to 4.7× compared to token pruning methods and achieves 46.8×–105.8× runtime improvements over defense baselines. STEMA further delivers up to 71× speedups and 397× energy efficiency improvements, demonstrating its suitability for secure and efficient ViT deployment, especially in edge environments."

However, training SNNs remains challenging because of the computational intensity of traditional backpropagation algorithms adapted for spike-based systems. In this paper, we propose a novel software-hardware co-design that introduces a hardware-friendly training algorithm, Spiking Direct Feedback Alignment (SDFA) and implement it on a Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM)-based In-Memory Computing (IMC) architecture, referred to as PipeSDFA, to accelerate SNN training. Software-wise, the computational complexity of SNN training is reduced by the SDFA through the elimination of sequential error propagation. Hardware-wise, a three-level pipelined dataflow is designed based on IMC architecture to parallelize the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the PipeSDFA training accelerator incurs less than 2% accuracy loss on five datasets compared to baselines, while achieving 1.1× ~10.5×and 1.37×~2.1× reductions in training time and energy consumption, respectively compared to PipeLayer."

    "abstract": "Although NAND flash memory has achieved continuous capacity improvements via advanced 3D stacking and multi-level cell technologies, these innovations introduce new reliability challenges, particularly lateral charge spreading (LCS), absent in low-capacity 2D flash memory. Since LCS significantly increases retention errors over time, addressing this problem is essential to ensure the lifetime of modern SSDs employing high-capacity 3D flash memory. In this paper, we propose a novel data randomizer, STate-Aware Randomizer (STAR), which proactively eliminates the majority of weak data patterns responsible for retention errors caused by LCS. Unlike existing techniques that target only specific worst-case patterns, STAR effectively removes a broad spectrum of weak patterns, significantly enhancing reliability against LCS. By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips. Experimental results demonstrate that STAR improves SSD lifetime by up to 2.3× and reduces read latency by an average of 50% on real-world traces compared to conventional SSDs."

    "abstract": "In recent years, High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies have revolutionized the research field of genomics analysis. With the advances in HTS, the amount of genomics data has grown exponentially, creating a major challenge in efficient genomic analysis. Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have been widely used as a major platform to accelerate genomics analysis, but their massive parallel processing power cannot be fully exploited due to the memory bottleneck. Our investigation shows that memory accesses account for more than 60% of GPU pipeline stalls for Genomics applications.In this work, we propose a lightweight process-in-memory (PIM) architecture that can significantly speed up GPU-based genome analysis by minimizing off-chip data movement. We first identify several commonly used memory-bound functions in sequence alignments. Then, a data processing unit is developed to integrate processing capabilities directly within the memory system. The proposed PIM technique can significantly reduce the memory transfer between GPU processors and memory, thereby exploiting the GPU computational power more effectively. Compared with other Process-in-Memory techniques that involve complicated design and memory-embedded processing cores, GenomeDPU only adds simple logics to the DRAM interface and has a much smaller overhead. Our evaluation results show that GenomeDPU can improve performance by as much as 8.37x and reduce energy consumption by 55%."

However, the analysis of Raman spectra is complicated by the fact that the spectrum contains a large amount of information about all substances included in the skin tissue. The paper is devoted to the study of methods for extracting informative features from optical biopsy data using the example of Raman spectra of skin neoplasms. The following methods of data dimensionality reduction and feature transformation are used as feature extraction methods: principal component analysis (PCA), projection onto latent structures (PLS), multidimensional curve resolution (MCR), and methods of feature selection based on their informativeness. The efficiency of the methods for extracting informative features is estimated using a classification model for malignant and benign neoplasms. As a result, optimal feature extraction methods are selected that allow physical and biochemical interpretation and also show high efficiency in the problem of identifying skin neoplasms."

Building upon these foundational material properties, the emerging potential of using parylene C as a substrate and insulating material is explored as a promising alternative for neuroimplant development, which naturally leads to a comprehensive comparative analysis of both polyimide and parylene C substrates that considers their mechanical, electrical, and biological properties - characteristics that prove critical for implant performance and longevity. The evaluation not only highlights each material’s unique strengths and limitations, offering valuable insights into their suitability for next-generation neuroimplants, but also addresses key challenges such as enhancing durability, optimizing efficiency, and minimizing immune rejection, all of which are essential to improving the reliability and clinical applicability of these devices. Expanding beyond material considerations, the study further delves into the long-term functionality of implants within biological environments, where critical factors such as degradation, tissue response, and mechanical wear over time are examined in relation to the previously discussed material properties, while also exploring various potential solutions including advanced materials and manufacturing techniques that could enhance device stability and performance. Finally, by synthesizing these multifaceted findings, the report outlines future prospects for developing flexible and durable neuroimplants, emphasizing how their continued refinement and implementation in clinical settings could significantly advance the field of neurotechnology through improved neural interfaces that bridge current technological limitations with emerging medical needs."

These measures should be taught in schools, and they should be refreshed periodically, because the information can change, be forgotten or updates might appear. Paramedics suggest that ideally, these refreshers should be done every year [1].

However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>, to address the challenges.

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of Large Language Model (LLM) intensifies hardware demands for energy-efficient, low-latency architectures with scalable memory bandwidth. While 3D chiplet integration addresses conventional systems’ memory wall limitations, three critical challenges persist: asymmetric compression constraints from divergent sparsity-precision requirements across attention/projection layers, tier-level load imbalance from static resource allocation in dynamic computation patterns, and coupling-induced signal degradation in high-density TSV networks, especially under LLM-phase-specific traffic with spatiotemporal burstiness. To address these, we present H3D-LLM, a vertically heterogeneous architecture combining analog/digital Computing-in-Memory (CIM) and Neural Processing Unit (NPU) chiplets through three innovations. First, a Sparse-Aware Dynamic Execution Framework (SADEF) with Precision-Adaptive Quantization Mechanism (PAQM) enables hardware-aware compression via layer-wise unstructured sparsity detection and INT4/8-FP/BF16 mixed precision. Second, a 3D Spatio-Temporal Interleaved Parallelism (3D-STIP) with Semantic-Aware Tiered Storage (SATS) eliminates resource imbalance and improves memory efficiency through dynamic sub-batch partitioning and Key-Value (KV) cache aware management. Third, a Phase-Adaptive TSV Management (PATM) scheme with dynamic encoding and cluster-based allocation enhances inter-connect efficiency and signal integrity through runtime-aware partitioning and phase-specific dataflow scheduling. Evaluations on Llama-7B demonstrate that H3D-LLM achieves 12.3× higher energy efficiency and 8.4× faster inference than the A800 GPU, while its TSV strategy increases eye height by 12% and reduces bit error rate by up to 60× compared to naïve 3D accelerators."

    "abstract": "Conventional quantum error correction (QEC) de-coders such as Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) and Union-Find (UF) offer high thresholds and fast decoding, respectively, but both suffer from high topological complexity. In contrast, Ising model-based decoders reduce topological complexity but demand considerable decoding time. We propose the Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector (SOME), a novel decoder that reformulates the QEC decoding task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem—termed the One-Hot QUBO (OHQ). Each variable in the QUBO represents whether a given pair of flipped syndromes is matched, while the error probabilities between the pair are encoded as interaction coefficients (weight). Constraints ensure that each flipped syndrome is matched exactly once. Valid solutions of OHQ correspond to self-inverse permutation matrices, characterized by symmetric one-hot encoding. To solve the OHQ efficiently, SOME reformulates the decoding task as the construction of permutation matrices that minimize the total weight. It initializes each candidate matrix from one of the minimum-weight syndrome pairs, then iteratively appends additional pairs in ascending order of weight, and finally selects the permutation matrix with the lowest total energy. SOME achieves up to a 99.9x reduction in variable count and reduces decoding times from milliseconds to microseconds on a single-threaded commodity CPU. OHQ also maintains performance up to a 10.5% physical error rate, surpassing the highest known threshold of MWPM."

    "abstract": "People face challenges with complex search tasks daily; chat-based large language models have the potential to assist search by helping with query formulation and content navigation, for instance. However, there is a lack of user research on integrating AI chat and traditional search to enhance Information Retrieval (IR) for the general public. This study explores how younger (25 participants) and older (22 participants) adults utilize these two platforms to retrieve information. Through two IR tasks, quality- and quantity-oriented tasks, focused on gathering evidence related to various countries’ CO2 emissions, younger users spent more time, issued more queries, and explored more external web pages than older adults in both tasks. In contrast, despite reporting less familiarity with AI chat, older adults relied more on chat to complete their tasks. They submitted longer queries for the quality task and reached the first query faster for the quantity task than their younger counterparts, reflecting a top-down IR strategy. In the end, task outcomes were similar for the two groups, indicating AI chat’s capability to support IR. Drawing from our study results and relevant literature, we propose five design requirements to harness the synergic value of search and AI chat in supporting IR."

To overcome these hurdles, we demonstrate a unified, data-driven framework that distills critical netlist optimization moves, including gate sizing, buffer insertion, and cell relocation, into \"optimization primitives\" learned by Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we develop a high-quality, synthetic optimization data generation pipeline with commercial tools at scale, while using a GPU-accelerated differentiable Static Timing Analysis (STA) engine to create fast feedback loop, enabling end-to-end gradient propagation to guide model learning. By training on both real and synthetic data across multiple technology generations, our approach captures fundamental PD optimization patterns that transfer seamlessly to unseen designs, overcoming the constraints of fragmented design representations and proprietary data in industrial PD flows."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of abnormal operations in power lines along the Hexi Corridor, which are prone to disruptions that affect grid stability due to complex geographical and climatic conditions, this study investigates a method for detecting abnormal operational states of these power lines based on BeiDou signal segmentation and piecewise matched filtering technology. BeiDou-2 monitoring equipment is installed at critical locations along the power lines, and a piecewise filter matcher is designed to mitigate BeiDou signal acquisition errors caused by NH codes. By integrating piecewise filter matching with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the parallel search of BeiDou signal phase and carrier frequency, the method achieves accurate signal acquisition and obtains line operational status information. This data is transmitted to a detection center where a CNN-LSTM detection model is constructed. The LSTM network learns the features of abnormal line operation states and completes the model training. By inputting the line operational status information, the model outputs anomaly results and triggers real-time alerts. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures BeiDou signals, eliminates NH code interference, accurately analyzes the operational status of power lines, reduces the maintenance time for abnormal conditions, and enhances line operational stability."

This article introduces a novel input power factor (IPF) control strategy for a dual direct matrix converter (DMC)-based drive, enabling independent control of IPF while mitigating common-mode voltage (CMV) without additional hardware. Unlike conventional approaches that inherently constrain the reactive power control range, the proposed method extends IPF control to absolute maximum ratings, unlocking unprecedented flexibility in grid-interfacing applications. A fully decoupled approach to output voltage synthesis and IPF control is demonstrated by leveraging a generalized complex-domain model, ensuring optimal control across varying load conditions. Experimental validation is conducted on a dual DMC prototype, verifying the superior performance of the proposed method. The results highlight an expanded IPF control range and elimination of high-frequency CMV, positioning this methodology as a disruptive advancement in matrix converter technology."

Nevertheless, the current design of lightweight neural networks exhibits three salient issues: firstly, the prevailing “one-size-fits-all\" network lightweight design pattern is notably inefficient; secondly, there is a deficiency in analysing the impact of lightweight operations on network performance; thirdly, the mutual influence among various lightweight operations is overlooked. To address these issues, firstly, we propose a neural network lightweightability measurement model and its computational method by investigating the effects of various lightweight operations; secondly, we propose a neural network general lightweight design framework (GLD) tailored for satellite on-orbit remote sensing images intelligent interpretation. Specifically, GLD, based on a meta-leaning approach, integrates knowledge distillation (KD), pruning and quantization, three general lightweight technologies, into a framework. It dynamically assesses the distillability, prunability and quantifiability of neural networks, and uses this assessment and uses this as supervision to dynamically jointly optimizes KD, pruning and quantization, making it applicable to various mainstream neural networks; furthermore, we explore the mutual influence among lightweight operations based on GLD; finally, through ablation experiments and comparative experiments, we further verify the effectiveness and superiority of GLD."

However, traditional visual interfaces often rely on specialized graphical representations and interactions, which require additional effort to learn and use. Natural language interaction offers a more intuitive alternative, but teaching machines to recognize diverse scientific concepts and extract corresponding structures from flow data poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce an automated framework that aligns flow pattern representations with the semantic space of large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for manual labeling. Our approach encodes streamline segments using a denoising autoencoder and maps the generated flow pattern representations to LLM embeddings via a projector layer. This alignment empowers semantic matching between textual embeddings and flow representations through an attention mechanism, enabling the extraction of corresponding flow patterns based on textual descriptions. To enhance accessibility, we develop an interactive interface that allows users to query and visualize flow structures using natural language. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling intuitive and intelligent flow exploration."

We focus on the notion of responsibility as answerability, which demands that individuals have a duty to supply their “reasons and justifications” for an action, or respond to inquiries about why they acted in a particular manner. We investigate the trust towards organizations that use mediator agents, people’s expectations from such agents, perceived benefits and risks of using this new intervention to enable answerability in organizations. Our findings indicate that providing explanations and offering remedies for harm through mediator agents does not affect the level of trust individuals have in organizations."

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-modal understanding</i>; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi-modal generation</i>. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models, respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions that may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI."

    "abstract": "Based on a large-scale annotated dataset, the deep network models have achieved outstanding performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR). Due to the interference encountered during measurement process and sample collection, it is inevitable that noise samples marked incorrectly will appear in the annotations, leading to a decline in the performance of the recognition model. In this paper, we propose a new causal diffusion model to eliminate this impact. The core idea is to construct clean pseudo-labels through causal intervention to participate in the training of the diffusion model. Firstly, a structural causal model (SCM) is constructed to describe and analyze the bias introduced into ATR by noisy labels, particularly those stemming from the measurement process and annotation ambiguity. This model, combined with the diffusion model, models the causal paths between variables under the condition of noisy labels from the perspective of a generative model. Secondly, a method called Causal Clean Pseudo-Label (CCPL) is proposed to filter and reconstruct timestep-dependent pseudo-labels from the noisy dataset. The new pseudo-labels can avoid the misleading effects of noisy labels on the diffusion model. Finally, the trained diffusion model is sampled to achieve efficient and robust recognition under noisy labels. Experiments conducted on two SAR datasets also demonstrate that this method can effectively handle the training of networks with varying proportions of noisy labels and outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

Despite their success, these transformer-based models often rely on submanifold convolution and attention layers, which introduce performance bottlenecks due to substantial weight parameters and high computational demands. In this paper, we propose two key hardware-friendly optimizations to address these challenges. First, we introduce a panel-level kernel mapping and weight-fetching strategy for weight-stationary computation, which minimizes data movement during submanifold convolution. Second, we propose a locality-based compression technique for attention queries and keys, allowing feature reuse from neighboring points to reduce the number of operations and memory requirements. Based on the optimizations, we develop a dedicated hardware tailored for 3D transformer-based 3D point clouds. Experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces memory accesses and enables efficient attention score computation with negligible accuracy loss."

Traditional architectural simulators utilized to evaluate these applications are highly sequential in nature, particularly for stateful components like caches. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to cache simulation by reframing the problem from a deep learning perspective. We exploit the fact that memory access traces in any part of a processor design can be represented as two-dimensional heatmaps. Our key insight is that the behaviour of a cache acts as a filter on these heatmap images which can be learned as a function using deep learning techniques. Leveraging this observation, we introduce CacheBox, a framework that employs a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn and replicate the filtering behaviour of caches using memory access heatmaps. We demonstrate that CacheBox effectively generalises across multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks, various cache configurations, different cache hierarchy levels, and even alternative microarchitectural structures with high accuracy. We also show that CacheBox enables highly parallelized inference, allowing for simultaneous processing of multiple memory access heatmaps."

The transfer function of the turbine with synchronous generator system is derived and approximated as a fractional-order transfer function to better represent its complex dynamics. Neural networks in MATLAB/ Simulink are then used to learn the response of the fractional-order transfer function under varying operating conditions, enabling data-driven identification of system behavior. Leveraging this model, a fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative controller is designed and implemented. To further enhance the system performances, an adaptive FOPID controller is developed, utilizing real-time AI-driven adjustments to tune fractional orders and gains in response to transient disturbances and load fluctuations. Simulation results demonstrate that the adaptive FOPID framework significantly improves system performance, achieving superior reference tracking, faster settling times, and enhanced robustness compared to the static FOPID controller. This paper highlights the potential of combining fractional-order modeling with AI-based adaptive control to advance the stability and efficiency of mini hydropower systems, offering a scalable solution for renewable energy integration in dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is utilized in HPC and AI/ML systems, as it provides a higher data rate and also a high memory capacity by stacking DRAM dies. In the quest for a higher HBM capacity, as the number of stacked DRAM dies is increased, the number of inter-die junctions with lower heat conductivity also goes up. This encourages the formation of localized high-temperature zones (hotspots), particularly with streaming memory accesses. With the current HBM address mapping, such accesses are directed to vertically-adjacent stack regions. To avoid data errors and thermally-induced damages from mechanical stresses, throttling mechanisms are employed to temporarily block requests to heated-up regions to let them cool off. Heating within the HBM stack is, therefore, the practical limiter of the number of layers and HBM capacity. A technique is proposed to remap streaming accesses to vertically non-adjacent physical banks in HBMs to reduce hotspots and, thus, throttling, to support more HBM layers. This mechanism is extended with activity-count based throttling to avoid per-bank temperature sensors. These mechanisms are evaluated using a cycle-level GPGPU simulator, validated device models, and a 3D heat propagation model to demonstrate their advantages."

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek, empowered by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, has driven significant advancements across diverse applications. However, a critical challenge arises during inference: Only a small fraction of experts are activated, causing severe token allocation imbalances among experts. This inefficiency poses substantial storage and computational burdens on resource-constrained devices, exacerbated by the lack of optimization strategies that integrate expert usage-aware parameter pruning and parallel scheduling, ultimately leading to suboptimal resource utilization. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-OPU, an FPGA-based overlay processor that optimizes parallel MoE inference through three key innovations. First, we introduce N:M sparsity (1:4/2:4/4:8/6:8/8:8) in the MLP layers and mixed-precision quantization (BF16/FP8/INT4) guided by expert activation frequency, reducing the parameter size by up to 2.76× while maintaining model accuracy (only 1.53% average drop after fine-tuning). Second, a lightweight prediction network dynamically predicts next-layer \"hot\" experts by analyzing historical activation patterns and current hidden states, achieving an average prediction hit rate of 83.4%. Third, a reconfigurable multi-core architecture maximizes the utilization of HBM bandwidth via a systolic array that natively supports sparse and mixed-precision computations, coupled with parallel concatenation to balance compute and memory efficiency. Experimental results on a Xilinx V80 FPGA with the DeepSeek-V2-lite model demonstrate that MoE-OPU outperforms the NVIDIA A100 GPU, delivering a 6.78× higher token throughput. Compared to RTX 4090 and U200 FPGA, MoE-OPU achieves 13.37× and 7.85× improvements, respectively. These advancements highlight the potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for scalable deployment of MoE-based LLMs on edge devices."

    "abstract": "Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a viable treatment modality for patients suffering from chronic renal failure often used as an alternative to hemodialysis due to medical indications or socioeconomic factors. Effluent peritoneal dialysate contains numerous substances diffused from blood via the peritoneum or synthesized locally within the abdominal cavity, some of them are potential markers of inflammation and should be monitored. It was shown earlier that different chromatographically separated fractions of CAPD effluent probably contain such clinically significant metabolites as advanced glycation end (AGE) products and indoxyl sulfate. The aim of this study is to further accumulate data on the possibility of detecting important biomarkers in CAPD effluent and urine using spectrophotometry and fluorescence spectroscopy in the UV-Vis wavelengths region. The first fraction separated by the Fast Protein and Metabolite Liquid Chromatography (FPMLC) is mainly responsible for proteins as we reported earlier. An analysis of the second fraction absorption and fluorescence spectra showed that it probably contains AGE. Absorption bands of third fraction demonstrated peaks, which is typical for urea and creatinine. Fluorescence spectral characteristics of third fraction are typical for indoxyl sulfate. Chromatograms of urine don’t have the first chromatographic peak, because urine samples were received from healthy individuals. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of urine has the same peaks for second and third fractions as for CAPD effluent. This allows us to suggest that AGE detected in CAPD effluent could at least partially originate from the bloodstream and not synthesized locally in dialysis fluid."

Relevance of research arises from the disadvantages associated with these approaches. Classes limited due to insufficient integration of digital teaching methods and require in-person specialist involvement. On-screen study incorporates digital methods, but still lack a true sense of presence, which adversely affects the motivation of students. Purpose of research consist in using VR popular and effective tool in the field of cognitive learning. The research task involves developing automated problem-oriented environments and scenarios with advanced level of immersion using VR tools. VR environments provide use a set of proven methods - gamification, personalized learning, visualization of goals, problems and tasks, virtual teaching assistant, study monitoring and feedback. Solution of a problem is to introduce a learning algorithm that uses sessions in VR scenarios with combination of digital learning methods and cognitive capabilities monitoring. Learning through an algorithm will improve motivation and develop non-standard types of thinking, such as synthetic and lateral, among students, allowing them to find new, unique solutions to everyday and work tasks. As a result, students will reduce influence of the external environment on themselves, which will make them less susceptible to psychoemotional stress.

    "abstract": "Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) utilize alternating fields (AC fields) within 100–300 kHz and electric field strengths above 1 V/cm for glioblastoma (GBM) treatment. However, the electric field is often reduced to a relatively low value (below 1 V/cm) due to the unavoidable thermal effects induced by Joule heating on the patient's skin. Objective: This study proposes a pulsed TTFields to enhance therapy effect, while reducing thermal effects. Methods: This work designed a TTFields generator to output 200 kHz AC fields. Cell experiments were conducted to compare cell viability between pulsed and conventional TTFields. A gel platform was used to measure temperature rises under clinical parameters of TTFields. A realistic head model with a tumor was simulated to analyze electric field and thermal distributions. Results: The designed generator can output two separate TTFields signals with 100 V voltage amplitude and 2000 mA current amplitude, meeting clinical trial requirements. Pulsed TTFields (10% duty cycle, 3.37 V/cm) achieved significantly lower cell viability (53.07%) than continuous TTFields (1.07 V/cm, 84.76%) while maintaining similar temperature rises. Gel experiments confirmed comparable temperature rises for both protocols. Simulations on a realistic head model demonstrated that pulsed TTFields achieved broader tumor coverage (electric field >1 V/cm) compared to continuous TTFields under equivalent thermal conditions. Conclusion: Pulsed TTFields can generate higher electric fields in targeted regions, significantly inhibiting cell proliferation while reducing thermal risks compared to continuous TTFields. Significance: The proposed pulsed TTFields may provide an optimized treatment method to enhance GBM therapy efficacy."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban streets for autonomous driving scenes. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban scene is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and Gaussian primitives, each associated with either a foreground object or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground objects , each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a 4D spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of objects and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066 * 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets.

Results indicate that the correlation coefficient between GNSS PWV and ERA5 PWV data is 0.97 (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.01), with a mean bias of -3.28 mm and a standard deviation of 2.70 mm. During the seawater encroachment, three notable increases in PWV were observed, with peaks ranging from 30 to 55 mm, all accompanied by precipitation (less than 10 mm). The PWV change rates varied spatially, with the Yellow Sea coast experiencing faster changes than the Bohai Sea coast. Under strong wind conditions, sea surface wave characteristics were manifested by increased wave heights and longer wave periods, alongside an increased whitecap coverage of breaking waves (3%–5%). The temporal variation curves reveal an inverse relationship between PWV and wave variables, with PWV lagging both breaking and non-breaking waves by approximately 3–12 h. Meanwhile, the process involves enhanced water vapor evaporation and intensified air-sea heat exchange. These factors affected the weighted mean temperature and caused a continuous decrease in PWV. Consequently, zonal differences in the spatial distribution of PWV were observed. By linking GNSS PWV with wave variables, this research introduces a novel insight for the study of air-sea interaction processes and coastal hazard monitoring under extreme weather events."

This paper investigates the extent to which visual embellishments Hand-drawn font lowered credibility. influence perceived message credibility in data visualizations. We conducted two crowdsourced experiments to examine both holistic and component-level effects of embellishment. In the first experiment, participants evaluated the relative credibility of plain bar charts versus two embellished variants—cartoon-style and image-style—across topics. Participants provided both comparative judgments and qualitative feedback. In the second experiment, we systematically isolated the influence of specific design elements—color, font, and bar style—on credibility perceptions through controlled variations. Our findings reveal that the impact of embellishments on perceived message credibility is complex and context-dependent. While certain embellishments, such as the use of color and image style bars, enhanced credibility, others—most notably hand-drawn fonts and cartoon-style bars—significantly undermined it. By operationalizing trust through the lens of message credibility, this work offers empirical insight into the design factors that shape viewers' perceptions. We conclude by proposing actionable design guidelines to support the creation of visualizations that are effective for communication and credible."

    "abstract": "In this study, we develop a fiber-based femtosecond laser system operating stably at the 1550 nm wavelength band by employing a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM) based mode-locking technique. The system demonstrates strong robustness against environmental variations over extended operation times and offers a wide frequency tuning range. A piezoelectric transducer (PZT) and motorized stage are used to precisely control the cavity length, thereby enabling extended repetition rate modulation. Experimental results confirm long term stability of mode-locking, even under external disturbances such as temperature fluctuations and mechanical vibrations. Dispersion compensation using dispersion-compensating fiber (DCF) minimized the pulse duration. The baseline output denotes the oscillator output before amplification; it was measured at the 10% monitoring port and scaled to the full-output level, exceeding 1.5 mW, while the amplified output was between 90 and 95 mW. The pulse duration is confirmed to be 73.4 fs through autocorrelation measurements. The Allan deviation analysis reveals a fractional frequency stability of 8×10⁻¹⁴ at 1-hour integration time. These results experimentally demonstrate the long-term stability and optical tunability of the fiber femtosecond laser system, providing a promising foundation for future ultrafast photonic applications."

This modeling simultaneously considers the dependence on frequency and the ionization of the ground which generally occurs during the injection of a high intensity current. We validate this modeling and we propose applications on grounding circuits used in wind farms.

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in urban areas, employing ground Base Stations (BSs) to serve UAVs has been proposed as a low-cost and promising solution. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) of UAVs served by ground BSs is impacted by multiple factors, including blockage, UAV height, transmit power, BS density, BS selection strategy, and so on. Efficient and accurate evaluation of the communication performance between UAVs and BSs is critical for network planning and optimization. In this paper, we analyze the communication performance of UAVs served by ground BSs in urban environments, where millimeter wave communication is employed. In contrast with existing works adopting a simplified Line-of-Sight (LOS) probability model, we adopt a more practical yet complex LOS model proposed by 3GPP for characterizing the densely distributed buildings in urban environments. Moreover, the distribution of BSs is modeled as a Matérn Hard-Core Point Process (MHCPP) with a minimum distance constraint to reflect real scenarios. The analytical expressions of outage probability and ergodic capacity under different BS selection strategies are derived for enabling efficient performance evaluation. We verify the accuracy of the analytical results through simulation experiments under both the Urban Macro (UMa) and Urban Micro (UMi) scenarios, while the impacts of multiple parameters are analyzed. The results indicate that the outage probability decreases as the UAV height increases, but the ergodic capacity shows an opposite trend. Moreover, we show that our analytical results can be used to select the optimal flight height for UAVs with a given required outage probability."

    "abstract": "It is known that escape routing on one component or between two adjacent components becomes more important in printed circuit board (PCB) designs. In this paper, the proposed routing algorithm is the first work to consider the length-matching requirement of any escape bus in the bus-aware simultaneous escape routing (SER) problem. Given a set of escape nets with some buses between two adjacent pin arrays and the capacity constraint between two adjacent pins inside two pin arrays, the bus-aware SER problem can be firstly formulated and an efficient algorithm can be proposed to solve the routing problem. In bus-aware SER for the given buses, based on the locations of the escape pins inside two pin arrays for any given bus, the routability-driven paths of some nets inside the bus can be firstly extracted from two-sided net untangling result and the routability-driven paths of all the nets inside the bus can be further assigned and routed for length minimization. In obstacle-aware SER for the remaining nets, based on the routing results of the given buses as obstacles and the division of the remaining routing space, the routability-driven paths of some unrouted nets can be also extracted and the routability-driven paths of the remaining nets can be routed inside the available routing region. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can use reasonable running time to avoid any through-bus net (TBN) and achieve the 100% routability of the escape nets for the 7 tested examples in bus-aware SER with TBN avoidance. In addition, compared with Yan’s algorithm and Sattar’s algorithm, the proposed algorithm only increase 1.8% and 1.9% of the total length of the routed escape nets to increase 1.7% and 1.7% of the routability for the 7 tested examples on the average, respectively."

First, a type of the hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is employed in the design of distributed interval observers, and the influence of the human operator is also taken into consideration. The hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism reduces the utilization of computation and communication resources in the human-in-the-loop multi-agent systems and avoids the Zeno behavior by introducing the minimum event-triggered interval. Then, a monotone system method is applied to design the distributed interval observers, and the ultimate uniform boundedness of the global error system is proved by this approach. Finally, both the applicability and efficiency of the obtained results are verified by human-in-the-loop multi-agent systems in the background of the F–404 aircraft engine system."

Existing lattice-based ring signature schemes are only traceable. They can de-anonymize a malicious signer, yet fail to stop the revoked signer from creating a valid signature. This contradicts the very notion of revocation. We introduce a polynomial-based revocation list. It is enforced with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge. Our protocol implicitly verifies the up-to-date revocation list during signature generation. Consequently, revoked signers cannot authenticate and are effectively excluded. Integrating this mechanism into a lattice setting, we obtain a compact revocable ring signature. The scheme is correct, anonymous, unforgeable, and truly revocable under the random oracle model. No costly key updates are required. Compared with prior trace-and-update schemes, our construction offers a practical post-quantum primitive. It guarantees both privacy and accountable revocation. Overhead analysis shows that we have added very little cost while ensuring true revocation."

    "abstract": "Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is an essential technology for spectrum sensing and management. Machine learning-based AMR techniques have garnered significant research interest. However, in practical applications, the effectiveness of AMR is hindered by variations in data distribution due to changes in carrier frequency, sample rate, and channel model. Existing deep learning methods struggle to adapt to these diverse distributions, and training separate datasets for each scenario is often impractical. To address these challenges, we propose a domain adaptive hybrid network (DAHNet) that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. This architecture leverages the phase and amplitude of constellation points, as well as time-series data from I/Q sequences. Additionally, by explicitly minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) between features from the source and target domains across multiple neural layers, we tackle the model generalization difficulties posed by varying propagation conditions and noise in complex electromagnetic environments. We validate our method using deep transfer learning on real-world data, with training results derived from the publicly available RadioML2016.10a and RadioML2018.01a datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method’s superior generalization ability across different spectrum scenarios."

    "abstract": "Multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) has potential for high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) imaging. Current research mainly focuses on its echo separation. However, how to achieve HRWS imaging based on separated echoes has been rarely discussed and remains as if all echoes are separated and reconstructed ideally so that some conventional imaging algorithms can properly focus. Thus, this paper proposes an HRWS imaging mode for spaceborne MIMO-SAR, named virtual delay-emission (VDE). First, the VDE delays the transmission time of some channels to reduce the effective phase center (EPC) redundancy of MIMO-SAR and increase the effective antenna area. Second, the VDE transmits orthogonal waveforms with the same autocorrelation function. Third, the VDE separates the mixed echoes and reconstructs the separated echoes in the frequency domain to achieve low azimuth ambiguity and high-resolution imaging. Some system simulations based on ALOS-2/-4-like system parameters are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the VDE achieves the 3<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>/900<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">km</i> mode if the system hardware is implemented properly."

    "abstract": "The memory footprint of modern applications like large language models (LLMs) far exceeds the memory capacity of accelerators they run on and often spills over to host memory. As model sizes continue to grow, DRAM-based memory is no longer sufficient to contain these models, resulting in further spill-over to storage and necessitating the use of technologies like Intel Optane and CXL-enabled memory expansion. While such technologies provide more capacity, their higher latency and lower bandwidth has given rise to heterogeneous memory configurations that attempt to strike a balance between capacity and performance. This paper evaluates the impact of such memory configurations on a GPU running out-of-core LLMs. Starting with basic host/device bandwidth measurements using an Optane and Nvidia A100 equipped NUMA system, we present a comprehensive performance analysis of serving OPT-30B and OPT-175B models using FlexGen, a state-of-the-art serving framework.Our characterization shows that FlexGen’s weight placement algorithm is a key bottleneck limiting performance. Based on this observation, we evaluate two alternate weight placement strategies, one each optimizing for inference latency and throughput. When combined with model quantization, our strategies improve latency and throughput by 27% and 5x, respectively. These figures are within 9% and 6% of an all-DRAM system, demonstrating how careful data placement can effectively enable the substitution of DRAM with high-capacity but slower memory, improving overall system energy efficiency."

Through detailed profiling, we identify inefficiencies, low occupancy, and memory access bottlenecks. We further analyze rank scalability and memory constraints, and propose optimizations to improve GPU throughput and reduce memory footprint.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a key technique in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enabling accurate prediction of molecular energies and forces with a level of precision comparable to that of Density Functional Theory (DFT), while significantly reducing computational cost. However, applying MLFFs to real-world scenarios, such as semiconductor process simulations involving massive atomic scales and long simulation times, exposes severe performance limitations, resulting in current MLFF models being inadequate for practical use and emphasizing the necessity of significant computational acceleration. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are frequently utilized to construct MLFFs, with tensor product operations constituting a substantial portion of the computational workload. These operations involve high-dimensional tensors whose sizes are determined by the number of channels and the order of rotation. This results in frequent memory accesses and low data reuse. This leads to memory bottlenecks that limit the efficient use of GPU computational resources. In this work, we propose a tensor-based function fusion technique to improve data continuity between functions, thereby increasing on-chip data reuse and reducing off-chip memory access. Furthermore, we identified inefficient utilization of hardware resources and addressed this by restructuring the computation flow and removing redundant operations to enhance computational performance. To optimize performance, we have also designed a dedicated tensor product hardware architecture that is optimized for GNN-based MLFFs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves an average speedup of 6.26× and a 424× improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based execution, while maintaining the original model accuracy."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)–based rendering has gained increasing attention due to its state-of-the-art quality and broad applications in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). However, the deployment of 3DGS in edge systems (~10FPS) faces challenge in achieving real-time (≥30FPS) performance due to computational resource constraints. Profiling reveals that the Gauss-Tile rasterization critically impacts pipeline efficiency due to its decoupled nature and computation-accuracy trade-off, which current hardware devices cannot effectively resolve. To this end, we propose a software-hardware co-design that performs rasterization via pattern matching. Our solution adopts flood encoding to represent tile coverage efficiently. It integrates a pattern-aware rasterization unit (PRU) and compresses the codebook using k-means clustering, preserving accuracy with minimal area overhead. At the architectural level, GauPRE adopts early depth-sorting and tile-group-wise rasterization to fuse coverage testing and alpha blending, enabling seamless data flow. We further integrated GauPRE with the GPU to support the end-to-end 3DGS rendering pipeline. Results demonstrate that the GPU+GauPRE delivers an 11.6× end-to-end speedup over the Jetson Orin Nano with only 0.1% area overhead. Meanwhile, the standalone GauPRE rasterization engine achieves 2.09× higher throughput compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS accelerator."

The silicon-based fabrication of spin-qubit devices allows them to scale to thousands of qubits while maintaining a relatively small area compared to other quantum technologies such as superconducting or neutral atom. However, the unique characteristics of spin-qubit devices limit the applicability of existing qubit routing methods developed for other quantum devices, and the state-of-the-art routing approach for spin-qubit devices overlooks some key factors, leading to suboptimal solution quality. We introduce a novel routing method for spin-qubit devices that leverages Dijkstra’s algorithm and breadth-first search to determine the routing path for the operand qubit(s) of each gate. To avoid redundant computations for routing paths, we determine the routing region for each gate and represent it as a bit vector, which enables efficient overlap checking between routing regions. We performed experiments on four benchmark sets, including circuits with up to 1617 qubits and more than 700,000 gates. These benchmark sets cover a wide range of quantum circuits, including reversible arithmetic, algorithmic, synthesized, and random circuits. Our proposed method resulted in high-quality routing solutions and outperformed the state-of-the-art qubit routing approach on spin-qubit devices with over 29% and 7% reduction in operation overhead and depth overhead, respectively."

Hardware accelerators are being explored to further enhance their performance, but current solutions are often limited by application specificity and the latency of encoding and similarity search. This paper presents a generalized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for HDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based content-addressable memory (SOT-CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates storage and computation, enabling inmemory execution of key HDC operations: binding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit shfiting), and efficient similarity search. Furthermore, a novel bit drop method-based permutation backed by holographic information representation of HDC is proposed which replaces conventional permutation execution in hardware resulting in a 6× latency improvement, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51× and 1.43×, respectively. To mitigate the parasitic effect of interconnects in the similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to ensure an accurate representation of the Hamming distance. Benchmarked at 7nm, the architecture achieves energy reductions of 21.5×, 552.74×, 1.45×, and 282.57× for addition, permutation, multiplication, and search operations, respectively, compared to CMOS-based HDC. Against state-of-the-art HDC accelerators, it achieves a 2.27× lower energy consumption and outperforms CPU and eGPU implementations by 2702× and 23161×, respectively, with less than 3% drop in accuracy."

    "abstract": "Distinct from low-frequency analog design, design of radio-frequency, millimeter-wave and terahertz frequency chips follows a complex co-design process between circuits and electromagnetics (EM). These two domains are strongly coupled to each other, and this makes the design process extremely complex. Similar to circuit topologies, EM topologies can be very diverse ranging from lumped elements such as inductors, capacitors to distributed passive structures such as transmission lines, antennas, and all possible combinations, taking one or more elements of the set. The design process from ideation to schematic to layout can be extremely time-consuming relying heavily on expert knowledge, manual interventions, and iterative tuning of predefined circuit and EM topologies. These methods follow a bottom-up approach, starting with fixed geometric templates and using trial-and-error optimization. Other than long design times, this limits innovation and accessible design spaces. Here, we present a series of approaches that introduce a fundamentally different strategy: a universal inverse design method that can generate complex electromagnetic structures and subsequently fabrication-ready RFIC design and layout from specifications. We present a reinforcement learning design framework that canvasses the space for RFIC topology, circuits and circuit parameters and then synthesizes the interface electromagnetic structures through a deep learning enabled inverse design framework. Collaboratively, this creates a specifications-to-GDS design and synthesis flow for RFICs. The designs that emerge through this are often non-traditional and non-intuitive, but can break many of the trade-offs of known topologies. We present fabricated and measured results in silicon ICs demonstrating the feasibility of the presented approaches."

Even with an extensive body of research on technology mapping, our experiments show there is still substantial room for improvement in the quality of results. As a solution, we introduce EqMap, an e-graph driven compiler that can better span the wide gap between SAT-based exact synthesis and heuristic cut enumeration techniques. EqMap’s improvements to synthesis produced circuits with 12% fewer LUTs on average over the vendor tools—without ever increasing circuit depth. We also provide an empirical analysis of the runtime of EqMap and show that it is still practical for large designs. Finally, we demonstrate that our compiler infrastructure is reusable, and future work can use our compiler for RTL equivalence checking or auditing the QoR of synthesis tools."

However, at advanced technology nodes, achieving sufficient hybrid bond density within a reduced chip footprint requires a 200nm bond pitch—beyond the limits of current manufacturing capabilities. To address this issue, we focus on block-level 3D IC design which has fewer top-level connections. Previous methodologies for block-level 3D IC design suffer from several limitations: (1) reliance on slow simulated annealing-based floorplanning, (2) suboptimal 3D design flows lacking post-route optimization, (3) a lack of attention to the critical initial step of soft block design, and (4) excessive hybrid bond usage that necessitates a 500nm pitch. To overcome these challenges, we propose a comprehensive methodology that includes: (1) a fast, gradient-based analytical solver, (2) Fence-3D flow, delivering up to 15% improvement in power-delay product, (3) ML-based congestion-aware soft block sizing, delivering up to 6.6% improvement, and (4) a partial-MLS method that selectively applies Metal Layer Sharing, reducing hybrid bond count by up to 71%.

Among SNN models, spiking transformers have shown great potential in achieving high accuracy while maintaining low energy consumption, making them ideal for resource-constrained applications. However, a significant challenge in accelerating Spiking Transformers lies in managing the inherent unstructured sparsity in spike activations. This sparsity introduces substantial hardware overhead, limiting the efficiency of existing accelerators.To address these challenges, we propose SPARTA, an algorithm-hardware co-optimization framework designed specifically for spiking transformers. SPARTA utilizes a spike-aware dynamic token skipping algorithm, which applies reinforcement learning to selectively skip less informative tokens, achieving structured token-level sparsity in both spatial and temporal domains. Additionally, we introduce the spike-aware token prediction algorithm to predict and eliminate inactive tokens, further improving efficiency. Meanwhile, we present a dedicated heterogeneous ReRAM-based Compute-in-Memory (CIM) hardware architecture tailored to support token-level sparsity, which integrates a ReRAM analog CIM engine for linear layer and a token-spike fusion engine for optimized token routing and spike attention. Experimental results show that SPARTA achieves up to 543.1× and 10.2× speedup with 308.0× and 5.2× energy efficiency improvement compared to GPU and the state-of-the-art SNN accelerator \"COMPASS\", while preserving high model accuracy."

    "abstract": "Thermal issues are critical in 2.5D/3D IC design, and liquid cooling provides an effective solution for heat dissipation. Widely used compact thermal models (CTMs) convert chips into circuit networks for fast thermal simulations. However, current matrix-solving acceleration methods for CTM-derived circuits are inadequate for high-speed iterative transient thermal analysis of large-scale liquid-cooled 2.5D/3D ICs during design optimization. In contrast, the random walk method can provide fast solutions for local nodes in large-scale circuit networks, but it is not applicable to the circuit networks of the CTMs with liquid cooling. In this paper, we propose LCTMwalk, a novel GPU-accelerated random walk method for transient thermal analysis of liquid-cooled 2.5D/3D ICs. To enable random walks on the liquid-cooled CTM-derived circuit network, we replace the voltage-controlled current source model with the diode model. Additionally, we improve the transient analysis by using a time-backward random walk with time-domain path reuse, accelerating the solution of temperature at local circuit nodes. Experimental results show LCTMwalk can solve million-scale cases in only 500 ms, and achieves a 14-22× speedup compared to the state-of-the-art alternating direction implicit (ADI) method with GPU. Besides, LCTMwalk exhibits good generalizability and can be applied to various 2.5D/3D IC structures with high accuracy (error<1 K compared to 3D-ICE)."

    "abstract": "Full yoga breathing is a technique that involves deep, rhythmic, and conscious respiration aimed at improving physical and mental well-being. However, many practitioners perform it incorrectly, which reduces its effectiveness. Traditional assessment methods, such as visual observation or spirometry with gas analysis, have limitations in terms of accuracy and ease of use. This study presents the development of a binary classifier designed to automatically determine whether a respiratory exercise induces a gas exchange shift, based on blood microcirculation data acquired via a distributed system of Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) analyzers. Data were collected from 28 experienced volunteers who performed full yoga breathing at frequencies of 3–3.5 and 1–1.5 times per minute. LDF sensors were positioned on the forehead and fingertips to capture microvascular responses before, during, and after the exercise. Spirometry with gas analysis was used as reference. The target variable was the achievement of moderate training hypocapnia, defined as end-tidal $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}\\left(\\mathrm{PetCO}_{2}\\right) \\geqslant 42$ mmHg. Four machine learning models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine and XGBoost. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance, with an AUC of 0.92 and balanced sensitivity and specificity. These results suggest the potential of LDF-based monitoring and machine learning for objective, non-invasive assessment of respiratory exercise effectiveness. Future work will aim to expand the dataset and validate the model across broader populations."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the linearity degradation of inductive displacement sensors subjected to large air-gap conditions and radial offsets of the rod. A novel electromagnetic inductive sensor is proposed to enable simultaneous measurement of axial displacement and radial offset. The sensor consists of circular excitation coils and orthogonally staggered radial saddle-shaped detection coils, effectively decoupling radial offsets along the x- and y-axes. A theoretical model based on radial relative offset coefficients is developed to evaluate the impact of radial offset on the linearity of axial displacement measurements. To improve measurement accuracy, a measurement method integrating a gaussian process regression (GPR) model and two-dimensional (2D) spline interpolation is proposed to estimate radial offset and compensate axial displacement errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces linearity errors to approximately 1.04% along the x-axis and 0.66% along the y-axis, corresponding to improvements of 79.47% and 82.60%, respectively. The maximum root mean square error (RMSE) for the estimated radial offset distance is limited to 0.44 mm in the offset direction. These findings validate the effectiveness of both the sensor design and the compensation method."

Hence, we surveyed the pathway-informed deep learning models in cancer research. In this survey, the pathway information used in pathway-informed models was summarized into four categories; pathway-informed deep learning models were divided into three major categories and seven subcategories based on the pathway information utilized and the strategies employed for its application. For each subcategory, the application strategy of pathway information is illustrated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the pathway-informed models are summarized. Besides, the commonly used interpretability methods and pathway databases are provided to assist in the design of more effective models. Finally, the challenges faced in developing better pathway-informed deep learning models are presented."

First, the 3D-LSMCM is initialized by using a hash function to generate a random chaotic sequence iteratively and it improves key unpredictability. Second, The Semi-Tensor Product (STP) measurement matrix constructed from these sequences significantly reduces storage requirements in CS whilst supporting lossless compression through arithmetic coding. STP technology enables flexible matrix dimension design, effectively lowering computational costs. Finally, STP is used to convert logical operations into matrix operations in the entire encryption process. The cryptographic technique consists of the STP-GoL scrambling, chaotic global scrambling with STP (STP-CG) and the chain XOR diffusion based on STP (STP-CXOR). Furthermore, theoretical analysis indicates that the computational complexity of this algorithm is expected to be reduced by approximately 28% compared with recent studies, while the average information entropy of the ciphertext reaches 7.9987. Overall, this study proposes a novel, secure and efficient image compression and encryption method, with its source code publicly available at https://github.com/Ssshou7/STP-GoL."

    "abstract": "The Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) has achieved thousand-second plasma discharges, placing unprecedented demands on its Magnetic Diagnostic System (MDS). Conventional integrators, limited by saturation, excessive drift (>1% Full-Scale Range, FSR), and nonlinearity, fall short of the requirements for prolonged discharges. This paper presents a comprehensively optimized alternating integration system designed to overcome these limitations. Through rigorous numerically-driven analysis and quantification of error sources, tailored compensation strategies were derived and key operational parameters optimized, promoting error convergence and ensuring precision consistency for distributed deployment. Bench tests over 4000 seconds show that 99.04% of integration drift samples remain within 0.1% FSR, while plasma experiments confirm a maximum drift of only 9 mV during the 1,066-second discharge. The system operates autonomously, performing self-correction of drift induced by sensor load variations and self-calibration of drift rates during alternation cycles, thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention. Excellent reproducibility has been confirmed through repeated testing. This system delivers the precision performance surpassing the all-digital integrator developed for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) at a fraction of the cost. Suitable for deployment across EAST’s full magnetic diagnostic array of over 600 sensors, it not only meets the stringent requirements for long-pulse operation but also establishes a reliable foundation for the upcoming Burning Plasma Experiment Superconducting Tokamak (BEST) program."

    "abstract": "With the growing deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in Electric Power Systems (EPSs), status measurements from switchable devices are transmitted at high sampling rates, enabling rapid detection of switching events and continuous topology updates. Fast topology processing is therefore essential for reliable operation and decision-making in modern, dynamic EPSs. In this context, this paper proposes an Algebraic Tracking Network Topology Processor (AT-NTP), developed from algebraic formulations and a new islanding identification method. Using status measurements from PMUs and other sources, the AT-NTP determines and updates network topology through matrix factorization and refactorization, avoiding graph search algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques commonly used in existing topology processors. The AT-NTP is simple to implement, avoids combinatorial explosion, and does not require training stages. It efficiently detects switching events, island formation, bus merging or splitting, and measurement configuration changes without recomputing the topology from scratch. Its formulation applies to arbitrary substation configurations without requiring adaptations, making it flexible and suitable for various systems. Simulation results on benchmark and large-scale real networks demonstrate the AT-NTP’s computational efficiency and confirm its suitability for PMU-based state estimation and advanced energy management applications."

    "abstract": "In object pose estimation where 2D–3D correspondences are unknown, accurate point set registration is essential for high-precision pose computation. Existing methods often struggle to balance convergence speed and success rate within a global search, particularly under poor initializations or occlusions. To address this limitation, this paper explores the application of a multi-member differentiated collaborative evolution strategy in feature point registration and proposes a heuristic point set registration method (DCER). Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy can efficiently converge from arbitrary initializations and achieve a high success rate. Although DCER can complete point set registration without prior information, its speed still cannot meet the requirements of real-time measurement. To address this, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is incorporated as auxiliary guidance, together with an adaptive search domain generation module and a self-occlusion point removal module. The combined method enhances continuous measurement capability in real-time scenarios. Experiments verify that the proposed method achieves stable and accurate continuous pose estimation over long periods and under various motion modes. It reaches nearly 100% convergence with visual computation time below 2 ms and significantly improves robustness and practicality."

To date, labeled chart pairs have been drawn from published empirical research results; however, such pairs are not comprehensive, resulting in a training corpus that lacks many design variants and fails to systematically assess potential trade-offs. To improve knowledge base coverage and accuracy, we contribute data augmentation techniques for generating and labeling chart pairs. We present methods to generate novel chart pairs based on design permutations and by identifying under-assessed features-leading to an expanded corpus with thousands of new chart pairs, now in need of labels. Accordingly, we next compare varied methods to scale labeling efforts to annotate chart pairs, in order to learn updated feature weights.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in emotion-state measurement using electroencephalography (EEG) have emphasized the importance of modeling the spatial relationship of brain signals. However, most existing GNN-based methods rely on single-level spatial modeling, which overlook the intrinsic spatial characteristics of EEG signals, including high intra-region similarity and distinct inter-region differences. In this work, we propose HDGNet, a hierarchical dynamic local-global graph representation learning method for the measurement of affective states. HDGNet incorporates both local and global graph structures based on prior knowledge to capture brain activities at multiple scales. Through hierarchical GNN modules, HDGNet processes interactions dynamically both within localized regions and across broader brain areas, enabling efficient learning of emotion-relevant patterns. In this paper, we focus on a comparative study on four datasets: SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V, and DREAMER. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method enhanced measurement accuracy and reliability across diverse datasets. Notably, the proposed model achieves accuracy improvements ranging from 6.95% to 14.39% on electrode-rich datasets (SEED, SEED-IV, SEED-V) compared to baseline. Further ablation and visualization analyses validate the effectiveness of HDGNet in capturing both intra- and inter-regional brain dynamics across varying emotional states.

Although the tomography method without wet MF (i.e., the One-Step method) has been proposed and validated, its performance is still susceptible to separate ambiguity treatment. To avoid this defect, this study proposes a refined One-Step tomography method that simultaneously estimates tomographic and other GNSS parameters from raw observations without wet MF. Tomography experiments were conducted during an extreme rainstorm in the Hong Kong region in September 2023. Wet refractivity retrieved from the refined One-Step method shows better performance than the traditional Two-Step method, exhibiting lower error by 5.8/10.1/27.1% (radiosonde reference) and 10.7/31.0/29.4% (ERA5 reference) for stages before/during/after the rainstorm. These results are also superior to those from the original One-Step method, manifesting the advantage of refinement for parameter estimation. Additionally, its capability for characterizing horizontal wet refractivity distributions was explored. Results of the refined One-Step method (and the original One-Step method) exhibit a 7.4% (1.6%) higher accuracy under symmetric atmospheric conditions, and a 57.2% (41.3%) higher accuracy under asymmetric conditions than the Two-Step method. Correlation analysis between accuracy improvement and asymmetric condition of atmosphere also indicates that the refined One-Step tomography method is more suitable for characterizing three-dimensional water vapor field during extreme weather."

    "abstract": "The concept of sharing has garnered significant attention over the past decade. Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems, which are common loads, can serve as distributed voltage balancers to maintain voltage balance on the load side, thereby enhancing overall system utilization and efficiency. To integrate voltage balance function without sacrificing the motor drive capability, this is achieved by augmenting a conventional PMSM drive: an inductor for voltage balance function; and a contactor and two diodes to add or remove additional voltage balancing function. The algorithm requires only minor adjustments to the proportions of the zero voltage vectors in the traditional seven-stage space vector pulse width modulation algorithm to simultaneously balance voltage and drive the motor. Additionally, by modifying the ratio of voltage control to voltage balance, the system can generate specific voltages suitable for used in a bidirectional dc/dc controller. Experiment validation confirms that the voltage balance function can operate independently or concurrently with motor drive function, offering flexibly deployment options."

By employing a multimodal model with a joint image and language embedding space, we propose a novel language-guided MSDA approach, termed LanDA, based on optimal transfer theory, which facilitates the transfer of multiple source domains to a new target domain, requiring only a textual description of the target domain without needing even a single target domain image, while retaining task-relevant information. We present extensive experiments across different transfer scenarios using a suite of relevant benchmarks, demonstrating that LanDA outperforms standard fine-tuning and ensemble approaches in both target and source domains."

However, progress in the automatic identification of elements under the surface (subsoil features), detectable only through proxies like soil and vegetation alterations, has been limited. This challenge is further compounded by the significant influence of seasonal variability and land use management on their visibility. Automatic identification often requires multitemporal observations to maximise the likelihood of obtaining favourable visibility conditions and to strengthen the reliability of each identification. Additionally, the limited availability of publicly accessible specialised datasets has impeded progress in applying deep learning approaches. This paper presents the first publicly available dataset of multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery for identifying palaeochannels, a specific category of subsoil features. We established a baseline for semantic segmentation by evaluating three architectures with various parameter configurations, specifically designed to address the unique challenges of segmenting these elongated and branched features under diverse landscape conditions at different times of the year. The results offer preliminary insights into addressing the varying visibility of subsoil features by applying deep learning to analyse temporal series. The dataset is available on Hugging Face and IIT Dataverse repositories."

However, existing deep learning approaches dependent solely on visual modalities may encounter challenges in discerning subtle variations amidst noise interference. To overcome these issues, we propose a multiscale semantic-guided synergistic interaction network (MSSI-Net), which utilizes the advanced multimodal semantic representations for enhancing the capacity to perceive hierarchical changes. Specifically, we first devise a multiscale interaction module (MIM) which leverages multiscale attention mechanism to guide the interaction between the coarse and fine stages of different visual features. The fine-grained visual features subsequently complement the semantic features through scale weight reassignment to enhance the discriminative capability of vision-language features. Furthermore, driven by the semantic-guided synergistic interaction mechanism, our developed cross-modal feature fusion module (CFFM) exploits both homogeneous and heterogeneous features among modalities. This ensures that the generated vision-language features are semantically representative. Finally, we formulate a manifold differential perception head (MDPH) to optimize the detection of changes by efficiently fusing diverse differential feature representations, achieving comprehensive performance enhancement. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (LEVIR-CD, CDD, SYSU-CD and WHU-CD) indicate that the designed MSSI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10× speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer a compelling solution for deep learning applications by providing customizable hardware architectures that enhance computational efficiency and flexibility. However, deploying these models on FPGAs introduces several challenges. Previous FPGA deployment workflows tend to focus on general machine learning tasks, lacking sufficient integration between software and hardware optimizations. Besides, FPGAs are constrained by limited on-chip and off-chip memory, posing significant challenges for weight storage. Moreover, the predominance of linear operations on the GPU runtime leads to significant computational bottlenecks. These obstacles necessitate innovative solutions to bridge the performance gap between FPGAs and GPUs while preserving model accuracyTo overcome these challenges, we introduce Robin, a fine-grained FPGA accelerator workflow that integrates both algorithm-level and hardware-level optimization. Robin leverages a weight compression technique based on Partial Block Circulant Matrices (PBCM), which effectively reduces storage demands while maintaining accuracy. Based on PBCM, our design employs a configurable circulant computing core that fully exploits the bit-width efficiency of DSP48E resources through two DSP packaging strategies to support both circulant and standard matrix operations. The combined end-to-end software-hardware co-design enables Robin to achieve up to a 3.09× increase in throughput and a 7.31× boost in energy efficiency compared to high-end Tesla A100 GPU implementations, making it a compelling solution for deploying RWKV models on FPGAs."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to present an efficient data security mechanism through the implementation of Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in the case of crypto-ransomware variant of attacks. The proposed solution relies on a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy, which enables dynamic encryption and decryption of data both in transit and at rest, using state-of-the-art authenticated encryption algorithms AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, which are dynamically selected according to the characteristics of the files, minimizing the performance impact on the system. For a secure management of cryptographic keys, a vault service was integrated, enabling the development of a Zero Knowledge architecture. Ransomware detection process adds minimal overhead compared to the traditional analysis methods. The proposed architecture provides improved data privacy and resilience against exfiltration attacks or data leaks. The stored data is fully encrypted and lacks identifiable metadata, enhancing protection against unauthorized access. Preliminary results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution and demonstrate the benefit of its integration into GlusterFS and HDFS platforms by substantially enhancing data security and protection within distributed systems as storage agnostic encryption security layer."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an enhanced distributed model predictive control (DMPC) strategy for autonomous vehicle platoons operating under adverse weather conditions. The original DMPC algorithm is extended by including a visibility-aware distance strategy, which dynamically adjusts the inter-vehicle distances in response to fog conditions. A normalized fog parameter is introduced to scale the desired headway according to environmental visibility, allowing each vehicle to adapt its behavior without centralized coordination. Two inter-vehicle distance strategies are evaluated: one with fixed distance and another with dynamically visibility-adjusted inter-vehicle spacing. Simulations were performed on a platoon of five vehicles in the presence of communication delays, demonstrating that the proposed fog-sensitive DMPC approach improves headway tracking accuracy and control smoothness compared to the fixed reference implementation. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating environmental awareness into predictive control for safer and more robust platoon coordination."

    "abstract": "Critical pattern selection is an essential foundation for lithography technologies such as full-chip Source Mask Optimization (SMO) and Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) model calibration. Traditional methods are mostly based on image feature extraction and clustering, without integrating lithography domain knowledge, and they suffer from high time complexity and excessive computational resource consumption. As a result, they fail to fully capture the optical characteristics of complex patterns and lack subsequent verification of the \"critical\" nature of the patterns. Moreover, past work often relied on manually annotated data, and the generalization ability needs further validation. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a semi-supervised critical pattern selection method based on frequency domain and LVM collaboration. This method defines the critical patterns by describing the optical characteristics of the patterns in the frequency domain and uses the ViT model to extract the nonlinear features of the patterns, ultimately selecting the critical patterns efficiently. This approach meets the demands of high-precision and high-efficiency lithography techniques for advanced processes. A series of simulations and comparisons performed using commercial tool, verify the validity of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Modularity—composing a large system using individually designed units—is an essential practice in hardware design. Yet, modularity might compromise quality: when individually designed units are put together, some of their states may become unreachable and, consequently, the logic that implements them is redundant. Sequential synthesis aims to remove redundant circuit logic by leveraging state unreachability. It critically depends on invariants—relations between signals and registers that hold in all reachable states—to prove the validity of redundancies. Yet, existing invariant generation techniques are mostly problem-specific (for a particular circuit or a property) or reliant on localized reasoning. We propose Promise, a fast circuit redundancy removal strategy. Promise exploits the rich information from simulation traces and uses efficient polynomial-time algorithms to infer global circuit invariants, optimizing the circuit and aiding other sequential synthesis procedures. Experiments show that Promise effectively optimizes circuits produced by high-level synthesis tools. Promise is open-sourced and available at github.com/ETHZ-DYNAMO/promise."

We address this via a reconfigurable lookup architecture with edge FPGAs. By coupling fine-grained quantization with adaptive lookup tables, our design minimizes energy-intensive arithmetic operations while preserving activation fidelity. FPGA reconfigurability enables dynamic hardware specialization for learned functions, a key advantage for edge systems that require post-deployment adaptability. Evaluations using KANs - where unique activation functions play a critical role—demonstrate that our FPGA-based design achieves superior computational speed and over 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> times higher energy efficiency compared to edge CPUs and GPUs, while maintaining matching accuracy and minimal footprint overhead.

Prior efforts to reduce this overhead often unnecessarily compromise throughput, diminishing SFQ’s key performance advantage. To mitigate this, we propose a timing-aware optimization framework that unifies and enhances both traditional full path balancing (FPB) and multi-phase clocking approaches. Inspired by timing-driven EDA strategies in CMOS, our approach explicitly models gate delays and jointly optimizes clock phase assignments, pipelining, and splitter tree construction, minimizing area and latency overhead while achieving a given performance target. On benchmark circuits, our timing-aware 2-phase clocking achieves up to 30% area and 29% latency reductions over FPB at a 27ps clock period. Compared to prior multi-phase methods operating at 42ps, we achieve 22% lower area and 23% lower latency. At a tighter 21ps performance target, our timing-aware single-phase clocking improves area and latency by 28% and 7%, respectively. All optimizations are implemented using scalable, polynomial-time algorithms."

We investigated how freeze-thaw parameters affect decellularization efficiency and ECM preservation in bovine and porcine pericardium. Samples were processed in liquid nitrogen or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based solutions, with up to 30 cycles and optional ultrasound exposure. Histological analysis confirmed high efficacy and highlighted the importance of medium selection and species-specific responses.

The combination of these computing trends necessitates the performance assessment of the impact of the RISC-V ISA and relevant processor implementations when executing serverless workloads. However, currently there is no benchmarking support for systematically evaluating serverless workloads on RISC-V systems. In this paper we bridge this gap in benchmarking support across the layers of the computing stack, from the application to the microarchitecture. We port the vSwarm serverless benchmark suite to the RISC-V ISA and enable the execution of the workloads in both real and simulated RISC-V platforms using the gem5 microarchitectural simulator. To demonstrate the usefulness of the infrastructure, we quantify the performance trade-off of cold vs. warm execution on a simulated RISC-V system and validate the results against a real platform. Overall, our enhanced benchmarking support creates new opportunities for further experimentation with serverless workloads on RISC-V systems, enabling the analysis and optimization of their performance across the computing stack."

Weight approximation is typically adopted in DSP packing to further reduce chip area. However, existing methods use indiscriminate weight approximation (IWA), which will lead to significant accuracy decrease for large language models (LLMs) and high lookup table (LUT) consumption for LLM accelerators. In this paper, we propose a new method, called discriminate weight approximation (DWA), for efficient DSP packing in LLM accelerators. DWA can reduce LUT consumption while guaranteeing accuracy. Experimental results show that compared with methods without weight approximation, DWA achieves a 1.5 times reduction of chip area and an imperceptible accuracy decrease. Compared with existing IWA methods, DWA achieves the same chip area reduction performance but reduces the LUT consumption by 2.6 to 4.6 times, which results in a five times reduction of deployment cost. Moreover, the accuracy of DWA is far better than that of existing IWA methods."

The KFCAM is used to I) obtain Chl time-varying rates from low-resolution (Landsat-8) images and high-resolution Chl information from Sentinel-2/SPOT5 images, simultaneously II) calculating the state error and Kalman gain; then III) this model integrates the high-resolution information into the time series by state updating model, and finally IV) synthesis continuous time series images for Chl with 10 m resolution. The results demonstrate that I) the synthetic Chl image with KFCAM exhibits high accuracy with a R2 of 0.906±0.047 and a RMSE of 1.801±0.369, and II) the RMSE values reveal a 12% and 33% reduction compare to the Spatio-Temporal Gap-Filling (STGF) and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) respectively. III) Furthermore, in comparative experiments that considered different assimilation time intervals and changes in land cover, KFCAM outperformed two reference models in terms of stability and anti-interference capability. It provides a novel means for large scale and global Chl detection."

    "abstract": "Seawater reverse osmosis desalination (SWROD) powered by renewable microgrid offers a sustainable pathway to meet community freshwater demand. However, optimizing off-grid system remains challenging due to the intermittency of solar and wind resources, and the variability of water consumption. This study develops a hybrid battery-tank storage model integrated with microgrid for SWROD operation to balance surplus renewable energy and deficit water demand. A fuzzy-genetic algorithm (FGA) minimizes the levelized cost of water (LCOW) with optimal component sizing while satisfying reliability constraints defined by the loss of water supply probability (LWSP). Mamdani fuzzy logic for multi-criteria decision-making comprises 27 rules implemented in MATLAB and utilizes the coefficient of variation to adaptively tune the GA parameters. A case study in Saudi Arabia evaluates six configurations based on five decision variables: SWROD capacity, water tank, PV panel, wind turbine, and battery storage. Results show that incorporating water tank significantly lowers LCOW by reducing reliance on battery storage while maintaining system reliability. Among the evaluated configurations, the PV/Wind/Battery/Tank topology proves to be the most cost-effective in terms of community-scale water supply, achieving an LCOW of 1.2004 $/m³. In contrast, systems lacking tanks or relying solely on wind exhibit higher LCOW, excess renewable energy and unmet water demand with reduced reliability factor. Project sensitivity analyses further reveal that water demand variability exhibits a stronger influence on LCOW than solar irradiance or wind speed. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates the techno-economic viability of standalone renewable-powered desalination systems, enabling cost-effective and reliable freshwater supply for coastal communities."

    "abstract": "In severely impaired stroke patients without visible movements, implementing robot-assisted therapy based on movement intention decoded from electromyogram (EMG) requires both sufficient residual EMG to drive robotic assistance and a patient-specific detector to ensure accurate, low-latency detection. However, identifying such a detector is challenging, particularly when the presence of residual EMG in a given patient is unknown. This paper proposes a systematic approach to distinguish between EMG data when the patient is relaxed versus attempting a movement.We investigated six different detector types and separation measures using retrospective EMG data from a previous randomized controlled trial. The results indicate that the approximate generalized likelihood ratio (AGLR) detector, along with the modified Hodges and modified Lidierth detectors, achieved the best separation between the data when a subject is relaxed compared to when he/she attempts movements. Using a subset of clinician-annotated data to evaluate detection performance, the modified Hodges detector combined with probability difference-sum ratio measure (MH-PDSR) showed good performance in terms of both accuracy and latency. Based on the EMG data from 30 severe stroke, we propose a PDSR threshold of 0.7 with the modified Hodges detector to identify patients with sufficient residual EMG. These findings suggest that the MH-PDSR approach can be used to learn a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">maximally separating detector</i> for a given patient which can be used both to screen patients for residual EMG and to provide a detector to drive robotic assistance if residual EMG is present. Further validation using larger datasets and evaluation of the resulting human machine interaction is warranted."

A two-layer constraint framework is introduced to ensure safe and coordinated formation control. Specifically, the outer layer maintains the perception-based topology by enforcing field-of-view constraints, while the inner layer constructs control barrier functions based on directional obstacle models defined in the robot's local frame, which prevent interrobot collisions and enable safe navigation in unknown environments. Furthermore, the proposed controller guarantees predefined-time convergence and maintains formation objectives even in the presence of unknown obstacles, by using a Lipschitz continuous projection operator to enable smooth transitions between rigid and flexible formations without violating FOV constraints. Finally, the presented framework is validated through a real-world experiment, which confirms its ability to achieve coordinated formation tracking and obstacle avoidance in a complex environment."

    "abstract": "Channel models are crucial for theoretical analysis, performance evaluation, and deployment of wireless communication systems. Traditional channel sounding systems are insufficient for handling the dynamic changes of channels in the next-generation space–air–ground–sea integrated networks (SAGSIN), which often results in outdated channel models that fail to provide reliable prior information for communication systems. To address this challenge, this article proposes an integrated channel sounding and communication (ICSC) method as a practical solution. Unlike orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) provides a full delay-Doppler representation of the channel, achieving optimal diversity in time-frequency doubly dispersive channels and effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges. Thus, this article investigates the fundamental principles of AFDM, showing how it enables simultaneous communication and channel sounding, and explores key performance metrics for both functionalities. Additionally, the distinction and relationship between channel sounding, estimation, tracking, and scatterer sensing are clarified. Several potential application scenarios for AFDM-ICSC are also examined. Finally, the article highlights the key challenges in implementing AFDM-ICSC, outlines future research directions, and offers valuable insights for the continued development of this technology."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in hardware design has primarily focused on generating functionally correct Verilog code, overlooking critical Power-Performance-Area (PPA) metrics essential for industrial-grade designs. To bridge this gap, we propose VeriOpt, a novel framework that leverages role-based prompting and PPA-aware optimization to enable LLMs to produce high-quality, synthesizable Verilog. VeriOpt structures LLM interactions into specialized roles (e.g., Planner, Programmer, Reviewer, Evaluator) to emulate human design workflows, while integrating PPA constraints directly into the prompting pipeline. By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g., synthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves PPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness. Experimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in area and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated RTL, validated using industry-standard EDA tools. At the same time achieves 86% success rate in functionality evaluation. Our work advances the state-of-the-art AI-driven hardware design by addressing the critical gap between correctness and quality, paving the way for reliable LLM adoption in production workflows."

For high-speed printed circuit boards (PCBs), transient current pulses increasingly affect the power integrity in PDNs, potentially leading to circuit malfunction or component damage. Decoupling capacitors (decaps) are placed on a PDN to ensure power stability. Minimizing the number of decaps becomes critical and has been extensively studied. Traditional heuristic methods often search for unnecessary spaces or get stuck in local minima. To overcome these limitations, we propose an analytical approach that reformulates the nonlinear decap placement problem as an equivalent integer semidefinite programming model. We adopt techniques like integer relaxation and port reduction to improve scalability and minimize the usage of decaps by an adaptive optimization scheme. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks demonstrate that our analytical decap placer achieves better results than the state-of-the-art non-deterministic methods and even significantly outperforms the commercial tool in solution quality and runtime."

Currently the creation of personalized valve prostheses is time-and resource-consuming, since the technology for their development from collecting the necessary patient data to 3D printing of the prosthesis is not automated. The paper aims at the creation of 3D models of personalized aortic valve prostheses. The task of the research is to develop the program code for the automatic creation of a threedimensional model according to the specified parameters. The proposed solution includes usage of Blender 3.6 software environment for 3D modeling, special algorithm for mathematical calculations of the 3D model parameters. As a result, a script was developed using known analytical expressions. The script provides the user with the ability to set the parameters of a personalized model and automatically build or update models based on the entered data. The ability to export a file in stl format for subsequent printing on a 3D bioprinter is also implemented. The developed script for creating a three-dimensional model of a personalized aortic valve allows for increased modeling efficiency by reducing the time it takes to create an artificial valve for a patient according to the principles of personalized medicine."

By eliminating heavy kernel tracing interrupts, DevTrace reduces overhead to negligible levels while maintaining data accuracy. In edge-based intelligence deployments, DevTrace achieves a 128× reduction in memory usage and approximately 10× lower CPU overhead compared to page-fault-based solutions. It significantly reduces data loss and performance degradation under high-load conditions, establishing it as a reliable tool for analyzing host-peripheral interactions and optimizing performance in resource-constrained environments. We also discuss potential extensions to eBPF to further decouple tracing from driver frameworks."

    "abstract": "As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation. However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL, leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions) and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i) self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance overhead) is imperceptible <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>."

    "abstract": "High-performance computing (HPC) and hardware acceleration increasingly rely on dataflow architectures to achieve scalable parallelism and efficiency. High-level synthesis (HLS) facilitates accelerator design from high-level programs, but conventional tools often require intrusive source-level modifications and struggle to optimize irregular workloads. Dynamically scheduled HLS frameworks offer a promising direction for addressing control flow divergence and memory irregularity by generating dataflow accelerators. However, they lack compile-time parallelism optimizations such as vectorization and incur significant hardware overhead. Moreover, modern compilers can generate vectorized code using memory access and computational patterns. Nevertheless, in programs with irregular control flow or data-dependent behavior, such patterns are unknown until runtime, limiting the effectiveness of static vectorization strategies.To address these challenges, we propose DynVec, a unified vector-dataflow framework that integrates dynamic scheduling and vectorization to exploit runtime parallelism beyond conventional models. We address the vectorization of irregular kernels through an MLIR-based context-aware vectorizer that effectively identifies vectorizable operations and, through dataflow scheduling, generates a vector-dataflow execution graph that explicitly models control flow constructs, data and control interfaces, and memory operations. DynVec encapsulates high-level elastic units designed with built-in vectorization support, allowing customizable and adaptive execution behavior. Our compiler preserves the structural hierarchy of the kernel by combining vector and scalar operations in a bottom-up, type-safe manner. Experiments show that our approach achieves significant speedup compared to state-of-the-art HLS implementations across various regular and irregular applications. Moreover, compared to hybrid accelerators that separately support dynamic parallelism and vectorization, DynVec delivers superior performance."

Near-Memory Processing (NMP) accelerators that stack memory directly on the compute through hybrid bonding have demonstrated high bandwidth with high energy efficiency, becoming a promising architecture for MoE models. However, as NMP accelerators comprise distributed memory and computation, how to map the MoE computation directly determines the LLM inference efficiency. Existing parallel mapping strategies, including Tensor Parallelism (TP) and Expert Parallelism (EP), suffer from either high communication costs or unbalanced computation utilization, leading to inferior efficiency. The dynamic routing mechanism of MoE LLMs further aggravates the efficiency challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose HD-MoE to automatically optimize the MoE parallel computation across an NMP accelerator. HD-MoE features an offline automatic hybrid parallel mapping algorithm and an online dynamic scheduling strategy to reduce the communication costs while maximizing the computation utilization. With extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that HD-MoE achieves a speedup ranging from 1.1× to 1.8× over TP, 1.1× to 1.5× over EP, and 1.0× to 1.4× over the baseline Hybrid TP-EP with Compute-Balanced parallelism strategies."

Although RAG mitigates common pitfalls of current LLM systems, its inherent heterogeneity and configurability introduce new challenges. The performance of RAG is crucial for meeting the high-throughput and low-latency demands of LLM services. Different components of RAG operate on different hardware platforms, and their complexity scales with the configurability and complexity of the rest of the system. For example, larger embeddings may enhance retrieval accuracy, but also increase the latency of embedding creation and indexing, thereby compromising the RAG system’s performance and energy consumption.Thus, a comprehensive characterization of an end-to-end RAG system becomes necessary. In this work, we build an end-to-end RAG benchmarking framework, Athena, that supports various embedding models, vector databases, index/search algorithms, and LLMs. By characterizing the system under various RAG settings built using Athena, we demystify RAG by identifying performance bottlenecks and quantifying the impact of each sub-component on overall system performance. In addition, the plug-and-play, open-sourced Athena framework is designed to assist future RAG research."

We develop miniGiraffe using a principled methodology: carefully characterizing Giraffe’s behavior and validating that our proxy faithfully reproduces its key computational features. miniGiraffe contains only 2% of Giraffe’s codebase, while producing identical outputs for the most computationally intensive code components and closely matches Giraffe’s execution time and scaling behavior in these regions. The simplified design of miniGiraffe enabled rapid experimentation across multiple architectures, which we utilize to perform an autotuning experiment of the mapping workflow; we found that specializing parameters to inputs and architectures provided a geometric mean speedup of 1.15× and up to a 3.32× speedup over the default parameters."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a multi-objective resource optimization framework for integrated access and backhaul (IAB) networks, tackling the dual challenges of timely data updates and spectral efficiency under dynamic wireless conditions. Conventional single-objective optimization is often impractical for IAB networks, where objective preferences are unknown or difficult to predefine. Therefore, we formulate a multi-objective problem that minimizes the age of information (AoI) and maximizes spectral efficiency, subject to a risk-aware AoI constraint, access-backhaul throughput fairness, and other contextual requirements. A lightweight proportional fair (PF) scheduling algorithm first handles user association and access resource allocation. Subsequently, a Pareto Q-learning-based reinforcement learning (RL) scheme allocates backhaul resources, with the PF scheduler’s outcomes integrated into the state and constrained action spaces of a Markov decision process (MDP). The reward function balances AoI and spectral efficiency objectives while explicitly capturing fairness, thereby resulting in robust long-term performance without imposing fixed weights. Furthermore, an adaptive value-difference-based exploration technique adjusts exploration rates based on Q-value estimate variances, promoting strategic exploration for optimal trade-offs. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms baselines, reducing the convexity gap between approximated and optimal Pareto fronts by 68.6% and improving fairness by 16.9%."

    "abstract": "The multi-source remote sensing images in mountainous areas are affected by variations in resolution, imaging angles, and atmospheric conditions, resulting in significant nonlinear radiation and geometric distortion discrepancies among the images, which pose a huge challenge to image matching. This article introduces a multi-source remote sensing image matching method specifically for mountainous areas based on spatial structural features. By mining stable structural information and combining multi-scale feature expression with log-polar coordinate measurement, the accuracy of the matching algorithm is improved. Firstly, we calculate the phase consistency structure map and use bilateral filtering to extract spatial structural features from the multi-source remote sensing images. Secondly, a nonlinear scale space is constructed using a nonlinear diffusion function, and a nonlinear weighted moment map is generated using the Log-Gabor filtering. The Harris algorithm is utilized to detect feature points within the nonlinear weighted moment map. Subsequently, the phase consistency direction is extended to generate absolute phase consistency direction features, and then the log-polar coordinate description framework is combined to calculate the feature vectors. Finally, the bilateral matching method is applied to obtain the initial feature correspondence, and the fast sample consensus algorithm is used to eliminate mismatches and achieve highprecision feature correspondence. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly enhances both the number of correct matches as well as the correct matching rate and overall matching accuracy when compared with traditional methods, providing effective technical support for applications such as remote sensing image fusion and change detection in mountainous areas."

    "abstract": "Modern software relies on a multitude of automated testing and quality assurance tools to prevent errors, bugs and potential vulnerabilities. This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and SnykCode) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs’ advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification. The open benchmark and JSON-based result harness released with this paper lay a foundation for reproducible, practitioner-centric research into next-generation automated code security."

    "abstract": "Emerging 6G wireless systems suffer severe performance degradation in challenging environments like high-speed trains traversing dense urban corridors and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) links over mountainous terrain. These scenarios exhibit non-Gaussian, non-stationary channels with heavy-tailed fading and abrupt signal fluctuations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel wireless channel model based on symmetric α-stable Lévy processes, thereby enabling continuous-time state-space characterization of both long-term and short-term fading. Building on this model, a generalized optimal control framework is developed via a fractional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that incorporates the Riesz fractional operator to capture non-local spatial effects and memory-dependent dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the fractional HJB equation are rigorously established, thus ensuring the theoretical validity of the proposed control formulation. Numerical simulations conducted in a multi-cell, multi-user downlink setting demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional HJB-based strategy in optimizing transmission power under heavy-tailed co-channel and multi-user interference."

    "abstract": "Classifying ground deformation processes, such as landslides, subsidence, deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs), and mining-induced deformations, is key for large-scale hazard assessment and national land use management. Earth observation provides heterogeneous data over the same geographic region, including Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series, multispectral imagery, and terrain products. However, effectively integrating such spatiotemporal information from multimodal datasets remains a major challenge. In order to fully utilize the rich information contained in the time series and to exploit the complementary strengths of spatial and temporal data, we propose a dual-branch deep learning approach that integrates InSAR ground deformation time series with geospatial information for classifying slow-moving ground deformation processes. To validate the approach, we construct a ground deformation dataset containing over 26,000 Active Deformation Areas (ADAs), labelled into four deformation types: Landslide, Subsidence, DSGSD, and Mining. Results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall classification accuracy exceeding 90% on both ascending and descending test dataset, though confusion remains between certain classes, such as landslides and DSGSD. Explainable AI (XAI) analysis indicates that spatial and morphological features contribute more significantly to classification performance than temporal deformation patterns, with clearer distinctions for subsidence and mining, but more overlap between landslides and DSGSDs. This work highlights the strength of multi modal data fusion method to classify ground deformation processes, while setting the stage for future research."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of plant biophysical properties is essential for understanding ecosystem functioning, monitoring forest health, productivity, and assessing the risk of disturbances. However, retrieval accuracy is often constrained by uncertainties in model parameterization, soil background effects, and spectral redundancy. This study systematically evaluates the influence of parameter range, band selection, and soil background on the inversion of Leaf Area Index, Chlorophyll content, Leaf Mass per Area, and Equivalent Water Thickness in Eucalyptus plantations throughout an entire growing season. Retrievals were conducted by inverting the PROSAIL model. Our approach led to three innovative findings: (i) the integration of trait-informed parameter ranges, tailored to Eucalyptus plantations, which substantially improves retrieval accuracy, especially for Leaf Mass per Area; (ii) the demonstration that band selection can reduce RMSE by up 58% for Chlorophyll content, 52% Leaf Mass Per Area and 69% for Equivalent Water Thickness; and (iii) the performance of soil background datasets strongly depends on the sampling strategy used and whether band selection was applied. These findings highlight that combining spectral optimization with contextual prior knowledge provides a robust framework for improving PROSAIL inversion in forest ecosystems, advancing remote sensing applications for plantation monitoring and sustainable management of natural resources. Moreover, this work presents a rarely explored application of PROSAIL inversion to forest plantations, extending its use beyond crop studies."

    "abstract": "As essential biometric features, fingerprints have been widely utilized in various security domains. However, the performance of conventional Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFISs) is limited by the quality of the external fingerprint (EF), particularly in cases involving damaged or deformed prints. Using the internal fingerprint (IF) acquired by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to address these limitations has emerged as a promising method. IFs can compensate for and restore missing ridge pattern features in degraded EFs, thereby improving the overall recognition accuracy of AFIS. However, the reconstruction of IF was significantly constrained by speckle noise in OCT images, making the accurate extraction of finger tissue contours complex and computationally intensive. To improve the applicability of OCT fingerprint, this paper proposes a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based OCT fingertip internal contour regression network, denoted as CRM-NAS. The CRM-NAS employs a NAS-based internal feature extraction module (NAS-IEM) to adaptively optimize the network architecture and complexity with noisy OCT fingertip data, facilitating the effective capture of global internal contour features. Furthermore, an attention-based contour regression module (Att-CRM) is introduced to refine local contour details by leveraging multi-scale intermediate features extracted from different network layers and to enable the generation of continuous and accurate internal contours. Experimental results demonstrate that CRM-NAS not only outperforms existing methods in terms of contour extraction accuracy, fingerprint reconstruction quality, and verification performance, but also maintains a relatively compact parameter size."

This paper introduces a modular series–parallel reconfigurable battery that simultaneously delivers a main high-voltage AC or DC port as well as isolated low-voltage DC auxiliaries using the same hardware stack. Each auxiliary output requires only a single transformer and diode, while a phase-shifted carrier modulation scheme time-decouples the power paths, enabling independent regulation of the main and auxiliary ports without relays or extra conversion stages. The main port operates bidirectionally, supporting both traction and single-phase grid charging through a minimal LC filter and phase-shifted PWM. A small-signal model of the auxiliary loop provides analytical PI tuning rules to ensure stability and fast transient response. Experimental validation with a three-module prototype confirms 95% efficiency, <5% ripple in voltage and current, and ~10 ms settling time for the auxiliary port. Compared with representative onboard charger architectures, the proposed design achieves reduced part count, sensing, and control complexity while maintaining full modularity, scalability, and native multiport capability."

Among them, unmanned aerial vehicles have attracted significant research interest as a representative application scenario. However, in multi-STAR-RIS scenarios, the coupling between STAR-RIS configuration and device scheduling not only presents optimization challenges in high-dimensional spaces but also leads to a trade-off between energy consumption and age of information (AoI). To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm, termed CORAL. The proposed algorithm jointly optimizes STAR-RIS coefficient matrices, unmanned aerial vehicle trajectories, device association and scheduling variables to maximize age-energy efficiency (AEE) in multi-STAR-RIS-assisted multi-unmanned aerial vehicle data collection networks. First, we introduce the AEE to quantify the achievable AoI gain per unit of energy consumption. Moreover, we formulate an AEE maximization problem and model it as a Markov decision process. Then, we develop the CORAL algorithm incorporating joint action-value estimation, natural gradient updates, and prioritized experience replay mechanisms to improve learning efficiency. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CORAL algorithm improves average AEE by 5.37% and 5.94% over reflecting/transmitting-only RIS under varying data transmission times and data upload thresholds, respectively."

Air local cryotherapy offers a non-contact, energy-efficient alternative to conventional methods like nitrogen and ice local cryotherapy but its effectiveness depends on precise control of cooling parameters to avoid tissue damage or insufficient therapeutic impact. This study develops a thermophysical model to predict temperature distribution in knee tissues during air local cryotherapy, addressing a critical gap in optimizing treatment protocols. The purpose is to simulate cooling dynamics under two airflow configurations: (1) single-stream cooling focused on the patella and (2) dual-stream cooling targeting the lateral and medial sides of the knee. A three-dimensional knee model, derived from the Visible Human Dataset, incorporates tissue-specific thermal properties, blood flow, and metabolic heat. Governing equations for bioheat transfer and fluid dynamics are solved using coupled computational simulations (ANSYS Fluent for airflow; ANSYS Mechanical for tissue heat transfer). Key results demonstrate that dual-stream cooling achieves more uniform surface coverage and a penetration depth, compared to localized patellar cooling. However, surface temperatures drop below freezing-a risk for tissue damage-while bone temperatures remain stable, highlighting challenges in cooling deep tissues. The model’s operability is confirmed, providing a foundation for future optimization of nozzle placement, airflow velocity, and exposure time."

Although the comprehensive pipeline remains in a developmental stage, this work details its envisioned architecture, encompassing data intake, preprocessing, model construction, and training strategies. It is anticipated that this non-invasive method, once fully developed, rigorously validated, and tested on diverse datasets, could achieve favorable accuracy. Ultimately, this approach aims to reduce reliance on more invasive, costly, or resource-intensive diagnostic procedures, potentially broadening accessibility to AD screening."

    "abstract": "The article presents the results of an evaluation of interhemispheric asymmetry in an electroencephalogram (EEG) of 20 stroke patients while they were immersed in virtual reality. A statistical analysis was performed using functions and statistical methods from the R: divers language packages for data processing and visualization, and the normality of the data distribution was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk criterion. The results of a nonparametric lead test were obtained, adjusted for multiple testing. The main goal of this study was to analyze EEG during virtual reality simulation to quantify any asymmetries in brain functioning. The method used to analyze the data included EEG recording, frequency-based signal separation, and statistical analysis. This allowed for a better understanding of neurophysiological changes that occur after a stroke, as well as opened up new possibilities for using virtual reality in rehabilitation. By monitoring brain activity in real time, we can track the recovery process and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic intervention."

    "abstract": "In deep-submicron technology nodes, I/O pin accessibility on the cells is crucial for successful net routing in physical design. For this reason, the conventional design flows have paid a considerable attention to acquiring the cell library with high pin accessibility to facilitate the net routing task. Nevertheless, the increase in routing failures is inherently unavoidable as the cell size shrinks with the progress of the technology node. In this context, this work proposes a new technique called adaptive pin-pattern modification (APM) to tackle this fundamental problem. Precisely, our proposed ECO-routing method based on adaptive pin-pattern modification makes use of three novel pin-pattern modifications on standard cells, which are referred to as pin-shift-trim (PST), pin-free (PF) and pin-bridge (PB). By applying these pin-pattern modifications adaptively and systematically to suit the circumstances to the individual cell instances with pin access failure, our ECO-router is able to explore the routable paths more extensively and effectively over the sequential, maze-routing based, ECO-routers but spend a much shorter time over the concurrent ECO-routers. Experimental results show that our proposed APM-enabled ECO-router resolves 17.7% of pin inaccessibility cases that a commercial tool has failed to find legal routes, with no penalty of chip PPA, and achieves over 116x speedup compared to the concurrent MCF (multi-commodity flow) based ECO-router."

    "abstract": "As Moore’s Law approaches its physical limits, Design Technology Co-Optimization(DTCO) has become a critical pathway for advancing semiconductor process nodes. As a communication channel between design and technology, standard cell library design demands rapid and precise estimation for functionally identical cells with variant layouts. However, existing estimation methods face significant limitations: Geometry-based approaches using wirelength estimation, while efficient, lack accuracy and granularity for timing-arc analysis; Post-layout SPICE simulations are accurate but extremely time-consuming. Current machine learning methods confront two major challenges: Most approaches perform prediction solely at the pre-layout stage, neglecting layout-dependent effects; Model training requires massive simulation samples, incurring substantial computational and temporal overhead. To address these issues, this paper proposes ProtoCellLayout, a novel cell layout power, performance, and area(PPA) estimation framework. Core innovations include: 1) Systematically explores the representation methods of standard cell layouts and proposes a graph-based method named Topology-Geometry Graph (TGG), which integrates circuit topology and geometric features. By explicitly encoding transistor-level connections and metal layer geometries, the TGG method overcomes the limitations of image-based and semantic representations in modeling physical effects. 2) A prototype learning mechanism leveraging CMOS logic’s structural regularity and routing pattern similarity, enabling performance generalization across complex cells using minimal simple-cell training data. Experiments on an industrial library demonstrate that ProtoCellLayout achieves <3.5% percentage error while reducing estimation time from hours to under one minute for cell delay, leakage, internal power, and transition time. Its performance rankings align closely with SPICE simulation, achieving over 95% accuracy in layout selection."

    "abstract": "We propose a simple and effective strategy for maze exploration and evacuation by reactive agents, which operate strictly on local observations with no memory or global knowledge. Such agents only react to nearby local stimuli. Our method introduces a dynamic cell-based weighting mechanism, where each explorable cell maintains directional weights guiding the agents’ movements. We employ a weight decay strategy which helps encourage the exploration of lesser-visited paths and reduce redundant traversal. Additionally, using the same weighting mechanism, the agents are able to locally detect dead-ends and block paths leading to them, further improving maze navigation. We validate our approach through simulations across a range of maze sizes, agent counts and weight decay values. Our experiments consistently show that the cell weighting strategy leads to faster exploration and earlier evacuation compared to purely random movement. The results show that reactive behavior, together with a weight-based local adaptation mechanism, can significantly enhance both exploration coverage and evacuation efficiency in maze environments. We achieve these improvements without requiring global coordination, memory or path planning, which makes our approach suitable for environments with significant resource constraints."

    "abstract": "Data processing on the edge offers advantages over cloud-based solutions, including reduced latency and lower energy consumption. However, to fully utilize edge SoCs, applications must be efficiently mapped onto these devices’ constituent heterogeneous processing units. This mapping is challenging, as modern SoCs incorporate diverse compute units, such as big.LITTLE architectures and GPUs with distinct performance characteristics. Furthermore, due to edge SoCs’ integration and resource constraints, execution on one processing unit can interfere with the runtime of others, complicating the construction of modular and composable performance models.To address these challenges, we present BetterTogether, a flexible scheduling framework that enables fine-grained software pipelining on heterogeneous SoCs. Applications are provided as a sequence of stages, each with a CPU and GPU implementation. These stages can then be pipelined across the various processing units on the SoC. The novel component of BetterTogether is its ability to generate accurate and efficient pipeline schedules using a profile-guided performance model that captures execution time under representative intra-application interference. We demonstrate the portability of BetterTogether by evaluating it on three SoCs with GPUs from different vendors (NVIDIA, Arm, and Qualcomm) and using three computer vision edge workloads with different computational characteristics. Our performance model yields predictions that correlate strongly with measured results. Using these models, we construct efficient pipeline schedules specialized to each workload-platform combination, outperforming homogeneous GPU baselines in nearly all cases, with a geomean speedup of 2.14x and a maximum of 7.59x. Finally, we present a preliminary exploration with Google’s EdgeTPU, highlighting BetterTogether’s extensibility to incorporate an even wider variety of processing units into its backend."

    "abstract": "The major challenge in evolutionary many-task optimization (EMaTO) is to transfer knowledge among the tasks effectively. Moving on existing EMaTO algorithms, which mainly focus on what kind of knowledge to select and how to transfer the selected knowledge, this article focuses on a novel perspective to tackle the issue of when to transfer knowledge. This gives rise to a requirement-driven adaptive differential evolution (RADE) algorithm. Specifically, the RADE introduces a dual-scale evolutionary state estimator (ESE) to evaluate the state of evolution from both temporal and spatial scales, obtaining the real optimization requirement of the population and thus adaptively controlling the timing of knowledge transfer. This way, RADE not only leads to efficiently dealing with the when issue, but also drives two adaptive strategies for knowledge selection and knowledge transfer, leading to more efficient dealing with the what and the how issues, respectively. In particular, a requirement-driven adaptive knowledge selection strategy merges the evolutionary state similarity and the population distribution similarity for enhancing the selection of relevant source knowledge. Then, a requirement-driven adaptive knowledge transfer strategy is executed based on adaptive parameters and operators, thus significantly improving the efficiency of knowledge transfer. Experimental results on the CEC19 and WCCI22 benchmarks show that RADE outperforms the compared state-of-the-art EMaTO algorithms in both effectiveness and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Robust localization is essential for emergency rescue operations, infrastructure inspection, and autonomous exploration in complex underground spaces. However, factors such as GNSS-denied conditions, semi-structured environments, and complex terrain in underground spaces pose significant challenges to robotic localization. To overcome these issues, we propose a LiDAR-based localization method that uses Gaussian-blurred Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) maps to achieve accurate and robust localization for robotic systems in complex underground spaces. Firstly, we propose a point cloud density ratio index model to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of localization methods in underground spaces, providing a foundation for the adaptive parameter adjustment of localization algorithms. Secondly, we propose a Gaussian-blurred NDT map construction method to improve the robustness of classical NDT registration. This method fuses the distribution information from neighboring cells to represent the distribution of the current cell using a Gaussian kernel function. Finally, we present an optimization-based localization method using the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and NDT. The initial robot pose is estimated in the prediction phase of the UKF, while the observed pose derived from NDT is used to correct the initial pose in the update phase, thereby achieving accurate localization. To validate the performance of our proposed method, comprehensive experiments are undertaken using both public and field test datasets. Satisfactorily, the absolute position root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 0.069 m, which provides a valuable reference for long-running, accurate, and robust localization in complex underground spaces."

Our work is inspired by the growing number of empirical studies in visualization research that rely on visualization literacy as a basis for developing effective data representations or educational interventions. Researchers have already made various efforts to assess this construct, yet it is often hard to pinpoint either what we want to measure or what we are effectively measuring. In this autoethnography, we gather insights from 14 internal interviews with researchers who are users or designers of visualization literacy tests. We aim to identify what makes visualization literacy assessment a “wicked” problem. We further reflect on the fluidity of visualization literacy and discuss how this property may lead to misalignment between what the construct is and how measurements of it are used or designed. We also examine potential threats to measurement validity from conceptual, operational, and methodological perspectives. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose several calls to action aimed at tackling the wicked problem of visualization literacy measurement, such as by broadening test scopes and modalities, improving test ecological validity, making it easier to use tests, seeking interdisciplinary collaboration, and drawing from continued dialogue on visualization literacy to expect and be more comfortable with its fluidity."

    "abstract": "The demand for wide-bandwidth and low-noise capacitive MEMS accelerometers is becoming increasingly urgent in fields such as acoustic measurement, high-impact motion detection and industrial condition monitoring. To extend bandwidth while maintaining control over the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this paper proposes a digital bandwidth compensation method that integrates physics-based compensation filter design with adaptive noise suppression. A lumped parameter model is derived from the physical measurement process of the MEMS accelerometer, yielding a high-order transfer function that robustly fits the sensor’s frequency response characteristics. Subsequently, the physics-based compensation filter is designed using the zero-pole placement method, which reduces the error of bandwidth compensation across a wide frequency range. When the compensation filter targets frequency bands with gain below 0 dB to extend bandwidth, it inevitably amplifies the sensor’s noise which is a drawback often overlooked in traditional bandwidth compensation methods. To address the noise amplification caused by compensation, an adaptive noise suppression method is introduced after compensation, which combines autoregressive (AR) modeling and Kalman filtering based on real-time autocorrelation analysis. The proposed bandwidth compensation method enables capacitive MEMS accelerometers to achieve wide-bandwidth and low-noise output. Compared with other representative bandwidth compensation methods, experimental results obtained from five independently fabricated MEMS accelerometers demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior bandwidth compensation performance. Specifically, it extends the bandwidth from 4100 Hz (Std: 173 Hz) to 6050 Hz (Std: 87 Hz), increases the linear regression coefficient R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of the phase response from 0.9163 (Std: 0.0083) to 0.9992 (Std: 0.0006), reduces the noise level from 8.95 mg (Std: 0.30 mg) to 5.18 mg (Std: 0.28 mg), and improves the SNR from 9.15 dB (Std: 1.43 dB) to 13.65 dB (Std: 1.20 dB). These results confirm that the proposed bandwidth compensation method effectively compensates for the frequency response and suppresses noise, thereby achieving superior bandwidth and SNR performance across different devices. This digital bandwidth compensation method facilitates the development of high-performance accelerometers that are particularly well-suited for engineering applications requiring high-precision measurements."

The impact of feature scaling was evaluated in terms of predictive performance (accuracy, MAE, MSE, R²) and computational efficiency (training time, inference time, memory usage). The results show that the ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) remain robust regardless of scaling, while models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, TabNet, and MLP are highly sensitive to the chosen scaler.

    "abstract": "The prediction of received signal strength (RSS) is essential for reliable coverage and efficient resource allocation in wireless networks. However, existing machine learning (ML)-based methods often lack generalization across diverse outdoor environments due to their dependence on large training datasets. This study proposes a geographical knowledge-driven RSS prediction method enhanced by transfer learning (TL). Geographic knowledge from open databases–including longitude, latitude, altitude, building heights, and land use–is quantified to represent the environmental characteristics of locations. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to capture the complex relationships between environmental characteristics and RSS, improving generalization across varying scenarios. TL is also applied to adapt the model to new environments using only a small number of labeled samples. The proposed method is validated using real-world data from two self-developed device-to-device systems operating at 920MHz and 429 MHz. The results show median prediction errors below 2.5 dB and 1 dB, respectively, with more than 80% of predictions within 6 dB and 3 dB. These findings confirm the method’s effectiveness in enhancing prediction accuracy and reducing data requirements compared to conventional ML-based methods."

    "abstract": "In Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-enabled edge sensing systems, unmanned aerial vehicles have emerged as the dominant low-altitude monitoring platform owing to their wide-area coverage. However, in large-scale surveillance scenarios, sensor limitations and the inherent difficulty in preserving discriminative features for tiny targets hinder robust small object detection. Therefore, we propose the MSFR-DEF-YOLO framework, which combines densely efficient flow YOLO (DEF-YOLO) with multi-scale feature reconstruction (MSFR) auxiliary branches. We first enhance fine-grained feature extraction by optimizing the network structure and integrating an efficient downsampling module (EDM). Next, a dynamic dense feature pyramid (DDFP) is designed to incorporate dense cross-layer connections and bidirectional feature flows, enhancing multi-scale context consistency. Additionally, the introduction of the MSFR auxiliary branch integrates shallow and deep features from the backbone network, enabling feature reconstruction and information compensation, thereby further improving small object detection capabilities. To verify the improvements, we tested a range of network configurations on different YOLO versions. Our model outperforms other versions in the YOLO series. Moreover, on four public datasets, MSFR-DEF-YOLO achieves mAP50 improvements of 8.8%, 6.9%, 1.8%, and 6% compared to YOLOv8n, all while using only 20% of the parameters of YOLOv8n. To further reduce the computational overhead, this paper proposes a lightweight MSFR-L-YOLO model that utilizes a unidirectional path neck design. Compared to MSFR-DEF-YOLO, this model reduces the number of parameters by 15% while maintaining high efficiency, thereby reducing computational requirements and achieving comparable accuracy. This provides an efficient solution for AIoT-enabled airborne sensing systems."

    "abstract": "In the Machine-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, enterprises can significantly reduce production costs by leasing devices from original equipment manufacturers (OEM), while OEM can enhance device quality by utilizing device data shared by enterprises. As such, MaaS is emerging as a very promising paradigm in modern manufacturing. However, the multidimensional data trend formed by the multidimensional data may leak the private production data of enterprises, particularly when the OEM leases the same type of device to enterprises. Currently, there is no targeted and feasible solution to ensure the privacy, integrity, and fault-tolerant of multi-user and multidimensional data in the MaaS model. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving and fault-tolerant distributed multidimensional data trend query scheme for MaaS. The proposed scheme ensures multidimensional data privacy through local differential privacy (LDP), and guarantees fault-tolerant and data integrity using Shamir secret sharing and hash-based message authentication code (mac). To protect the privacy of multidimensional data aggregation trend, we design a weighted noise injection query algorithm based on LDP. Additionally, the scheme mitigates the risk of data leakage by introducing the blockchain (BC) instead of cloud server (CS). We formally prove the security of our proposed scheme, and the experimental evaluation demonstrates that it outperforms existing schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead."

    "abstract": "Automated Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is challenging due to intra-class variations and inter-class similarities. FER can be especially difficult when facial expressions reflect a mixture of various emotions (aka compound expressions). Existing FER datasets, such as AffectNet, provide discrete emotion labels (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">hard-labels</i>), where a single category of emotion is assigned to an expression. To alleviate inter- and intra-class challenges, as well as provide a better facial expression descriptor, we propose a new approach to create FER datasets through a labeling method in which an image is labeled with more than one emotion (called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">soft-labels</i>), each with a different confidence. Specifically, we introduce the notion of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">soft-labels</i> for facial expression datasets, a new approach to affective computing for more realistic recognition of facial expressions. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel methodology to accurately calculate <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">soft-labels:</i> a vector representing the extent to which multiple categories of emotion are simultaneously present within a single facial expression. Finding smoother decision boundaries, enabling multi-labeling, and mitigating bias and imbalanced data are some of the advantages of our proposed method. Building upon AffectNet, we introduce AffectNet+, the next-generation facial expression dataset.

This increased volume has also enabled the use of pangenome graph references, which provide better quality alignments because they represent variation, but they require new algorithms that are usually slower than those using a traditional reference genome, and exhibit different computational characteristics.We introduce PangenomicsBench, the first benchmark suite targeting computational pangenomics, with six CPU and two GPU kernels extracted from popular tools, designed to guide future research in pangenomics software and hardware acceleration. We characterize these workloads to reveal the following key insights: (a) Seq2Graph mapping algorithms are limited by control complexity rather than memory access to the reference graph because they process small, cache-friendly subgraphs. (b) GPUs have the potential for large speedups, but are limited by control divergence for mapping workloads. (c) Pangenomics introduces computational patterns different from traditional genomics like stochastic gradient descent. (d) Pangenomic mapping algorithms are highly sensitive to reference graph structures. (e) There are opportunities for optimizing existing software."

    "abstract": "Computing-In-memory (CIM) processors have emerged as a promising approach for accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs). To unleash the potential of diverse CIM architectures, it is essential to develop a tailored compiler that is aware of both the architectural parameters of CIM processors (e.g., CIM array size, number of CIM units, on-chip buffer capacity) and their dataflow characteristics (e.g., CIM parallelism, dataflow scheduling, buffer allocation). However, existing CIM compilers primarily focus on hardware parameters, while neglecting the diversity of dataflow patterns across different architectures. In this paper, we propose CIMWise, a general, IREE-based, end-to-end AI compiler for CIM processors. At its core, an auto-tuning framework has been developed, comprising a comprehensive search space (including both hardware parameters and dataflow characteristics), an analytical cost model (integrating an adaptable on-chip memory model), and a two-stage simulated annealing search algorithm, to explore optimal scheduling strategies for the target workload on CIM processors. Additionally, CIMWise leverages IREE’s frontend for graph-level optimization and implements a customized backend to perform operator-level optimization using the proposed auto-tuning framework, enabling seamless end-to-end deployment of neural networks on CIM processors. The proposed CIMWise is validated through actual hardware measurements. Experimental results show that CIMWise achieves up to a 58% reduction in energy consumption and a 19% decrease in latency compared to prior CIM compilers."

The framework proposes a unified instruction extension interface for seamless integration with diverse RISC-V SoC ecosystems. Based on the unified interface, APS introduces a cross-level architecture description language (CADL) for comprehensive instruction behavior specification, which is translated into a dynamic pipeline architecture through its synthesis flow. Besides, APS’s compiler infrastructure introduces a pattern-matching engine for the automated utilization of ISAXs in general programs. It also incorporates bitwidth-aware vectorization that leverages operand bitwidth information to reduce the overhead of calling ISAXs. We conduct case studies across multiple workloads, including cryptography, machine learning, and digital signal processing. With fewer than 175 lines of ISAX description, APS achieves 2.29× to 14.99× speedup for each case study, demonstrating APS’s practical productivity and acceleration capability. Overall, APS offers a complete, end-to-end methodology that significantly reduces the development cycle of ISAXs, making agile processor specialization practical to the research and open-source hardware communities."

    "abstract": "Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs) are an emerging class of deep learning models that process data with both real and imaginary components. By efficiently handling complex-valued representations, CVNNs have gained attention as a promising alternative to traditional Real-Valued Neural Networks (RVNNs), especially in domains such as signal processing and communications. A fundamental distinction between CVNNs and RVNNs lies in the use of Complex General Matrix-Matrix Multiplications (CGEMMs), each comprising four real-valued GEMMs along with additional operations. As such, CGEMMs impose substantial compute and memory burdens on CVNNs. Although modern systolic arrays have evolved to enhance GEMM performance with their high compute throughput, these architectures are suboptimal for CGEMMs due to two key limitations: (1) redundant data fetches and (2) underutilization of Processing Elements (PEs) within the array. To address these challenges, we propose HALO, a novel systolic array architecture that accelerates CGEMM execution through logical partitioning of the array. HALO divides a single array into logical sub-arrays, enabling concurrent execution of CGEMM sub-operations, thereby aggressively utilizing given PE resources with simple hardware modifications. We explore two execution modes of HALO: Half Mode and Quad Mode. Half Mode reduces duplicated data fetches and improves PE utilization, whereas Quad Mode offers even higher utilization but does not address the redundant memory access issue. To maximize performance across layers, HALO switches between the two modes on a per-layer basis, leveraging the proposed mode selection algorithm. Our evaluation demonstrates that HALO improves performance by 44.3% and achieves a 32.3% reduction in energy-delay product."

Within this framework, we introduce models based on early fusion, which incorporate additional feature maps into the input arrays to support and enhance visual feature extraction. The primary objective is to investigate the impact of this early fusion approach in combination with different types of encoders that perform either spatial or spatio-temporal analysis. The encoder architectures considered include 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 3D CNNs, and Transformers of varying complexity. Furthermore, two variants of the LSTM decoder are explored: one that imposes a fixed output sequence length through the architecture, and another that allows for flexible interpretation of the output sequence via the loss function. The model is trained end-to-end and evaluated on the GRID Corpus dataset."

    "abstract": "Timing optimization following clock tree synthesis (post-CTS) is a crucial step in very large scale integration (VLSI) physical design for achieving timing closure. During this stage, clock skew significantly impacts circuit timing performance, making useful skew optimization essential for enhancing design quality. However, traditional skew optimization methods face challenges due to their insufficient consideration of physical implementation constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a GPU-accelerated differentiable concurrent clock and data (CCD) optimization framework, which simultaneously optimizes clock skew and logic delays to enhance overall timing performance with the consideration of physical constraints. We implement the CCD optimization method as a step involving buffer sizing in the clock network and refining placement results. The key innovation of our approach lies in formulating a smooth and differentiable process for CCD optimization with a calibration mechanism to ensure accurate gradient computations. Additionally, we employ an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based strategy to decompose the entire optimization problem into several manageable subproblems, effectively balancing timing optimization with physical implementation constraints. Experimental results on open-source industrial benchmarks demonstrate that our CCD optimization framework achieves superior timing closure compared to a baseline approach within an open-source physical design tool. Our method yields an average improvement of 22.4% in worst negative slack (WNS) and 45.0% in total negative slack (TNS), along with a 9.434× runtime speedup. To our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate clock skew effects into gradient-based timing optimization."

    "abstract": "The use of mathematical modeling to create a feature space of blood parameters allows to move from a subjective assessment of symptoms to an objective assessment of biochemical changes associated with mental illness. This approach is consistent with modern trends in psychiatry aimed at integrating biological markers into the diagnostic process. The proposed methodology for visualizing laboratory data in the form of a “Heat Map” is a tool that helps to increase the objectivity and speed of analyzing clinical information. Unlike traditional methods of interpreting laboratory parameters based on discrete values and reference intervals, color coding allows you to visually assess the complex interaction of blood parameters, identifying changes that can be missed during routine analysis. The use of neural networks to analyze the feature space formed on the basis of laboratory data opens up prospects for identifying hidden correlations and predictors of the development of mental disorders. The implementation of the developed software module into clinical practice can significantly improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses, as well as increase the effectiveness of training medical specialists. Integration of this technology into existing medical information systems will allow doctors to quickly access visualized data and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of information."

However, technology mapping algorithms often assume a simplified delay model and may not faithfully optimize the circuit under a realistic cost function involving area, delay, and power objectives. In this work, we introduce GradMap, a gradient-descent-based technology mapping framework that integrates a differentiable static timing analysis (STA) engine with a linear delay model for accurate delay estimation. Additionally, it enables simultaneous buffer insertion and gate sizing during technology mapping, providing a holistic optimization solution. Experimental results show that the new method achieves an average improvement of 7% in area-driven optimization, 33% in delay-driven optimization, and 25% in area-delay-product optimization compared to the ABC technology mapper. We note that although the gradient-descent method has significant runtime overhead compared to the highly efficient ABC mapper, it is highly parallelizable with GPU acceleration (in a way similar to the neural network training process), besides attaining high optimization quality far beyond ABC’s ability."

    "abstract": "Analog circuit design consists of the pre-layout and layout phases. Among them, the pre-layout phase directly decides the final circuit performance, but heavily depends on experienced engineers to do manual design according to specific application scenarios. To overcome these challenges and automate the analog circuit pre-layout design phase, we introduce DiffCkt: a diffusion model-based hybrid neural network framework for the automatic transistor-level generation of analog circuits, which can directly generate corresponding circuit structures and device parameters tailored to specific performance requirements. To more accurately quantify the efficiency of circuits generated by DiffCkt, we introduce the Circuit Generation Efficiency Index (CGEI), which is determined by both the figure of merit (FOM) of a single generated circuit and the time consumed. Compared with relative research, DiffCkt has improved CGEI by a factor of 2.21 ~ 8365× , reaching a state-of-the-art (SOTA) level. In conclusion, this work shows that the diffusion model has the remarkable ability to learn and generate analog circuit structures and device parameters, providing a revolutionary method for automating the pre-layout design of analog circuits.

    "abstract": "Intermittently powered devices, such as batteryless energy harvesting systems, rely on checkpoint and recovery to maintain progress across frequent power failures. Differential checkpointing reduces the high cost of checkpointing by saving only the modified memory regions. Existing hardware-based approaches have presented significant benefits by tracking memory modifications using block-based hardware trackers. On the other hand, they have limited scalability as the hardware cost proportionally increases with memory size, which is critical in recent intermittent systems featuring more resources. Furthermore, their designs only support synchronous checkpointing where the MCU is blocked during the backups, failing to hide huge checkpoint latency. This paper proposes FLASC, a hardware-software co-design which scales with increasing memory size as well as supports safe and efficient asynchronous checkpoint executions. Our evaluations on FPGA show that FLASC achieves 9.4% faster execution while using only 49.1% hardware resource compared to the state-of-the-art, resulting in 1.85x efficiency per hardware resources. Furthermore, FLASC presents 6.9x better scalability with increasing data memory size, effectively addressing the scalability challenge of existing architecture."

Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive approach that utilizes an iterative behavioral model refined by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in real time, enabling direct estimation of capacitor mismatch parameters that determine INL behavior. Our algorithm dynamically selects measurement points based on current model uncertainty, maximizing information gain with respect to parameter confidence and narrowing sampling intervals as estimation progresses. By providing immediate feedback and adaptive targeting, the proposed method eliminates the need for large-scale data collection and post-measurement analysis. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in total test time and computational overhead, highlighting the method’s suitability for integration in production environments."

    "abstract": "Device sizing is a critical yet challenging step in analog and mixed-signal circuit design, requiring careful optimization to meet diverse performance specifications. This challenge is further amplified under process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, which cause circuit behavior to shift across different corners. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in automating sizing for fixed targets, training a generalized policy that can adapt to a wide range of design specifications under PVT variations requires much more training samples and resources. To address these challenges, we propose a Goal-conditioned RL framework that enables efficient policy training for analog device sizing across PVT corners, with strong generalization capability. To improve sample efficiency, we introduce Pareto-front Dominance Goal Sampling, which constructs an automatic curriculum by sampling goals from the Pareto frontier of previously achieved goals. This strategy is further enhanced by integrating Conservative Hindsight Experience Replay to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. To reduce simulation overhead, our framework incorporates a Skip-on-Fail simulation strategy. Experiments on benchmark circuits demonstrate ∼1.6× improvement in sample efficiency and ∼4.1× improvement in simulation efficiency compared to existing sizing methods. Code and benchmarks are publicly available HERE."

However, during in vitro studies, the environment surrounding the tissue sample changes significantly. It is essential to approximate the conditions of preliminary research as closely as possible to real ones. This study investigates the problem of changes in the electrical resistance of brain tumor tissues during in vitro experiments due to alterations in their surrounding environment. The use of $\\mathbf{0. 9 \\% ~ N a C l}$ saline solution is proposed to approximate in vivo conditions. The aim of this work is to study the effect of $\\mathbf{0. 9 \\%} \\mathbf{~ N a C l}$ saline solution on impedance measurements in in vitro settings. To achieve this goal, the resistance of tumor tissues immersed in saline solution ($0.9 \\% \\mathrm{NaCl})$ was measured, as well as without it. A comparison of the amplitude and phase characteristics of impedance in these two environments was conducted, and a methodology for in vitro studies was described. The experimental results and comparative analysis revealed that the use of $0.9 \\% \\mathrm{NaCl}$ saline solution does not critically affect the study outcomes, meaning it can be effectively utilized in in vitro research."

Accurate PM2.5 prediction is crucial for issuing early warnings to mitigate health risks and for helping governments take timely action against pollution. In the research field, PM2.5 prediction is a key application of time-series forecasting. LSTM models, as deep learning methods excelling in time-series forecasting, are widely used in relevant studies. This paper uses TimeRes-BiLSTM, a variant of LSTM, for PM2.5 prediction, incorporating simultaneous pollution data like PM10 as auxiliary factors. Experiments were conducted using Chengdu, Sichuan's PM2.5 dataset (2019-2022) and comparisons were made with other models. Results show that the TimeRes-BiLSTM model exhibited good predictive performance in both short- and long-term forecasting."

These mechanisms enable the robot to move its center of mass (COM) in any direction, and increase its maneuvering capabilities by selecting a variety of locomotion gaits. A kinematic model of the robot and a quasi-static force analysis are used to optimize the design and evaluate its motor requirements. Experiments demonstrate that combining the sprawling mechanism with FBEM enables the DSTAR to both crawl and drive, overcome a wide range of challenging obstacles, and improve its climbing capability by 66% compared to symmetric FBEM designs (such as RSTAR). The robot can crawl and maneuver over rough terrain using its unique turtle-gait method, roll sideways to surmount wall obstacles up to 20 cm high, travel horizontally across uneven ground, and switch between wheels and whegs to adapt to different terrain types, including dirt, stones, and grass.

The challenge becomes greater when source and target data differ in acquisition modality, as in remote sensing where variations in sensor type (e.g., optical vs. radar), spectral properties (e.g., RGB vs. multispectral), or spatial resolution are common. This challenging scenario, known as Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (SSHDA), requires learning across modalities with limited target labels. In this work, we propose SAHARA (Semi-supervised Adaptation in Heterogeneous domains via conditional Adversarial Representation disentanglement and Adaptive pseudo-labeling), a new method for SSHDA that combines conditional adversarial feature adaptation with dynamic pseudo-labeling to learn domain-invariant features and handle extremely scarce target annotations. Experiments on two heterogeneous remote sensing benchmarks for scene classification, conducted with both convolutional and transformer-based backbones, demonstrate that SAHARA consistently outperforms existing SSHDA and semi-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "It is challenging to achieve an optimal worker allocation for production lines of large-scale industrial enterprises due to the complex requirements for workers’ capabilities. Some optimization approaches have been proposed to solve this problem from different perspectives. However, they have not fully explored the multidimensional features of both workers and production lines, making it hard to obtain an optimal allocation. This article proposes a novel approach to collaborative allocation optimization of production line workers by incorporating multidimensional feature measurement and the environment-classes, agents, roles, and objects (E-CARGO) model. First, we develop a comprehensive evaluation system to quantify the diverse features of workers and production lines. Based on it, an adaptability assessment mechanism is designed to measure the matching degree of workers for different production lines. Afterward, the role-based collaboration theory and the E-CARGO model are innovatively utilized to formalize the worker allocation problem. Meanwhile, the key constraints are identified to guarantee the reasonability of allocation, and an efficient solution via CPLEX package is proposed. Finally, the case analysis and simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

In this kind of analysis, a sinusoidal voltage signal of constant amplitude is injected into the PVM, and the input signal frequency is adjusted within a minimum-to-maximum range. However, the injection of a sinusoidal voltage signal does not reflect the behavior of the PVM subjected to pulsed light. Therefore, this paper evaluates a two-stage hybrid method to obtain the open-circuit voltage of a photovoltaic module subjected to fixed-frequency pulsed light. In the first stage (experimental), the PVM current under static conditions and the output voltage of the photovoltaic module subjected to pulsed light are obtained. In the second stage (simulation) of the hybrid method, the PVM output current and voltage data are processed. The results show that the difference between the simulated output voltage and the experimentally obtained voltage has a root mean square error of approximately zero. Additionally, the results for the total impedance of the equivalent circuit show linear behavior. Finally, the hybrid method is tested using monocrystalline and polycrystalline PVM manufacturing technologies."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of ubiquitous connectivity, the Internet of Unmanned Agents (IUA) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed intelligent perception and decision-making. In such systems, numerous unmanned agents collaboratively collect environmental data to support coordinated tasks. To preserve data privacy, Federated Learning (FL), as a decentralized machine learning framework, enables collaborative training of a global model across agents without directly exchanging raw data. However, FL faces several critical challenges in IUA environments, including high communication overhead under constrained wireless bandwidth, potential privacy leakage from shared model parameters, and agent dropouts caused by unstable connectivity. To address these challenges, we propose PPE-FL, a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient federated learning scheme designed for IUA scenarios. PPE-FL replaces conventional high-dimensional gradient uploads with lightweight ranking-based votes, substantially reducing communication overhead. Then, we design an obfuscation mechanism to protect the privacy of locally generated ranking-based votes, safeguarding both raw data and intermediate parameters. Furthermore, PPE-FL supports mask reconstruction through partial interactions among online unmanned agents, enabling robust aggregation under dynamic network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PPE-FL reduces communication costs by 89.5% compared to VCD-FL and by 87.7% compared to PPML, while maintaining model accuracy and privacy protection."

    "abstract": "The magnetic components made of thin laminated silicon steels are viable candidates to work within the medium frequency range, and are often exposed to the power electronic rectangular voltage excitations. The related energy loss of thin laminated silicon steels produced in that context should be predicted accurately and efficiently. However, the traditional loss models, for instance Steinmetz equations, are empirical in nature, thus requiring a lot of experimental data to extract their coefficients. Contrarily, the numerical loss models are prohibitively time-consuming. In this paper, a fully analytical loss model for sinusoidal excitations is firstly derived by applying the Statistical Theory of Losses (STL) and the fractional derivatives for the classical eddy current loss component. Then the relation between sinusoidal excitation loss and rectangular excitation loss of duty cycle 0.5 is constructed. Thereby, a pure analytical loss model of laminated silicon steels for rectangular voltage excitations with arbitrary duty cycle is developed with the concept of separately treating the positive and negative parts of this kind of excitation. Finally, the predicted losses of two laminated silicon steel samples under the rectangular voltage excitations with different duty cycles by our proposed model, complex permeability model and Improved Generalized Steinmetz Equation (IGSE) are compared with the measured ones, verifying the superiority of the proposed model, and only a few data measured under normal sinusoidal excitations are needed to identify it."

Yet, we find that this progress does not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for interpreting charts. We introduce ENCQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. ENCQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size."

However, in traditional solutions, the synchronized signal is limited to be a single-tone signal. In numerous applications, broadband microwave signals are required as a prevalent choice for radar transmission. We innovatively applied broadband signals to a microwave photonic phase detector for the first time. A linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal with a bandwidth of 100 MHz and a 13-bit Barker code signal are successfully synchronized to femtosecond laser pulses for phase noise suppression. The phase-locked signals exhibited phase noise levels of -114.38 dBc/Hz for the LFM signal and -114.97 dBc/Hz for the 13 bit Barker code signal, measured at a 10-kHz offset from the carrier frequency. Furthermore, synchronization experiments involving broadband signals with varying pulse durations and bandwidths are also carried out, confirming the adaptability of the proposed system. We finally achieved the synchronization of a 1-GHz bandwidth LFM signal based on an MPPD."

However, existing approaches often suffer from insufficient meta-knowledge transfer due to reliance on a single source domain, and fail to fully bridge the domain gap owing to the use of single-level alignment strategies. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous data-driven, global-to-local cross-domain FSL framework for HSIC, leveraging richly labeled natural RGB images and hyperspectral data as source domains to support classification in the target domain with only a few labeled samples. The proposed method consists of two stages. In the first stage, we employ natural RGB images to learn a powerful spatial feature extractor with FSL and self-supervised learning, which will be fine-tuned for HSI in the second stage. To alleviate the domain gap between the source and target HSI domains at the second cross-domain FSL stage, we propose a global-to-local domain adaptation strategy that performs alignment both at the domain level and class level, effectively reducing the learning bias toward the source HSI while promoting discriminative feature learning. Additionally, to address large intra-class variance in the target HSI domain, we introduce a self-supervised contrastive loss based on positive pairs only, enhancing the within-class representation compactness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), such as NVIDIA’s Hopper and Blackwell, leverage Thread Block Clusters (TBCs) to enhance performance and resource management. TBCs introduce a hierarchical organization, grouping thread blocks into clusters that enable efficient synchronization and distributed shared memory access. This innovation improves data locality and reduces latency in inter-thread block communication, unlocking new opportunities for executing complex parallel workloads. However, modeling the intricate interactions within TBCs, especially the balance between data locality and resource contention, is challenging. This is further complicated by limited access to cutting-edge hardware like Hopper GPUs, which restricts direct experimentation. As a result, robust simulation models are needed to accurately replicate TBC behavior. This paper presents a detailed simulation model that captures TBC performance characteristics. Our model enables researchers to explore TBC functionalities and evaluate performance implications without requiring physical Hopper GPUs. Validation against an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows a Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) of 4.7%, demonstrating the model’s accuracy and utility for advancing research in GPU architectures and parallel computing."

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data. However, as graph sizes grow, GNNs face significant scalability challenges. To address this problem, previous work has proposed sampling and sparsification techniques aimed at enabling training on subsets of the original graph rather than on the entire graph. These mechanisms introduce trade-offs between memory requirements, accuracy, and training time. Moreover, the selection of a suitable sampling or sparsification strategy, as well as its optimal configuration, depends on multiple factors, including the graph size and the GNN model in use. However, a comprehensive and unbiased comparison of different strategies is lacking. Furthermore, these mechanisms have mostly been evaluated on small and medium-sized graphs consisting of a few million vertices or fewer, and not on large-scale graphs that would benefit from themTo fill this gap, this paper presents an extensive evaluation of sampling and sparsification techniques on graph datasets of varying scales from two popular benchmark suites. The study explores the trade-offs mentioned above. Our experiments reveal that selecting an appropriate set of optimizations substantially reduces computational load and memory consumption, resulting in faster training times while maintaining final accuracy. Additionally, we find that stochastic sampling methods reduce convergence time by approximately 55% compared to partition-based techniques. Graph Attention Networks improve final accuracy by about 1% over other models but require up to 3 times more GPU memory. Furthermore, graph sparsification consistently reduces GPU memory usage by over 18%."

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in edge and mobile applications, but the large memory requirements of GNN hardware limit their deployment on resource-constrained devices. A common solution is graph partitioning, which splits large graphs into smaller partitions that fit into on-chip memory. However, this creates halo nodes—duplicated nodes across partitions—that lead to frequent and redundant accesses to external DRAM. This paper presents SiGNoR, an efficient graph partitioning approach that introduces three hardware-friendly techniques to reduce memory access with negligible accuracy loss. First, 1) similarity-based node reuse reduces redundant DRAM access of halo nodes by leveraging only local nodes within the same partition. To further improve the impact of the halo-to-local node replacement on GNN accuracy, 2) multiphase graph partitioning is proposed to refine partition boundaries by iteratively identifying and modeling its effects. Finally, 3) partition-wise block floating-point is presented for an energy efficient GNN accelerator hardware. The proposed partition-wise block floating-point shares a single exponent across all node features within each partition, reducing memory usage. Experimental results show that SiGNoR reduces average DRAM traffic of 44.5% with negligible accuracy degradation for GNNs across six real-world graph datasets. The GNN accelerator also improves energy efficiency by up to 2.6× compared to previous GNN hardware."

    "abstract": "Debugging hardware designs requires significant manual effort during hardware development. After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in simulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time analyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated hardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs and deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques only utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug localization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware systems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test generation problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond the initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization. Witness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty design. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test cases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements and localize the buggy ones. To further refine the suspicious area, we define the criteria for effective witness test cases and use a mutation-based strategy to generate such test cases. Based on this approach, we propose an automated hardware bug localization framework named Wit-HW. We evaluate Wit-HW on 41 bugs from various hardware designs. The experimental results show that Wit- effectively localize 49% / 73% / 88% bugs within Top-1 / Top-5 / Top-10 ranks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug localization techniques. Additionally, we evaluate Wit-HW on 13 real-world bugs collected from open-source hardware projects, showcasing the robust performance of our method."

The former employs a smart eigenvalue modification to avoid the system partition in the SOTA EI-NK that may induce numerical instability in nonlinear system partitioning. The latter decouples the solutions of the linear and nonlinear systems and reduces the three-layer nested iteration in EI-NK to one single Newton loop similar to conventional BDF, thereby significantly enhancing the performance and robustness of EI for generic nonlinear circuits.

All models incorporate Grad-CAM to assess interpretability. Trained on combined public datasets (Montgomery, Shenzhen, Darwin), the baseline model achieved the highest segmentation performance (Dice 0.9514, IoU 0.9070, coherence 0.9056). UNet-AttAll offered a strong balance between accuracy and interpretability (Dice 0.9246, coherence 0.8695), while UNet-Att1 underperformed across all metrics. While the classical U-Net achieves the highest Dice score (0.9514), our fully attentive variant (UNet-AttAll) demonstrates superior interpretability and a competitive Dice score (0.9246).

    "abstract": "Fault detection and fast diagnosis in electric power networks are critical concerns for energy systems performance and safety, as untimely electrical events (temporary over-increases of specific parameters, decreases of values below established thresholds, or protection triggering at the power line level) have either minor or major effect over the electric power infrastructure. Regardless of the diversity of the industrial architectures met while on-field situations, a comprehensive overview of recorded data must be available. In this context, designing a distributed data acquisition, monitoring and recording system with a high degree of adaptability, such as providing synchronized event-triggered recordings, is required. This work provides an efficient event synchronization and record triggering method, based on IoT remote interaction between the nodes of the distributed system, in which the relevant processing is exclusively performed at the edge of the afferent network. The method has already proven its utility in a controlled experimental fault testing environment, being suitable for various electric power architectures."

Sign language is a communication system that includes movements of the hands, face and body. It is used by people who cannot speak, but also in everyday communication between people, especially when encrypted communication is desired. The aim is to detect and understand sign signals using machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. These signals are usually transmitted through movements of the limbs and facial expressions. The detection process involves identifying and classifying these movements with the aim of translating their meaning.

The research methodology included the construction of attractors and the calculation of the correlation dimension parameter. This parameter allowed us to identify a statistically significant increase in the chaos of the regulatory systems for patients with pulmonary disorders when compared with the control group. The highest value of the parameter was observed for patients with obstructive disorders. In addition, a comparative study of the geometry of phase portraits in patients with disorders and the control group was conducted in order to detect specific patterns. The proposed approach to the analysis of heart rate variability in patients with pulmonary diseases allows us to identify changes in the behavior of regulatory systems, which goes beyond the diagnostic capabilities of linear models. The results emphasize the prospects for using nonlinear methods for differential diagnostics and assessing the functional state of the human body."

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based algorithms demonstrate strong feature extraction capabilities, yet their performance largely depends on parameter-intensive network architectures. These complex models contain redundant parameters that impair real-time performance. Meanwhile, they exhibit sensitivity to noise and lighting variations, often leading to recognition errors. To address these limitations in real-time operation and robustness, we propose a lightweight and robust finger vein recognition network (LRFVNet) based on multi-scale feature fusion, included a shallow feature extraction module, a deep feature extraction module, and a feature fusion module. Specifically, to achieve efficient real-time feature extraction and fine-grained discriminative capability, we propose a dual-branch architecture. The shallow branch employs a streamlined convolutional layer structure to capture vein patterns with minimal computational overhead, while the deep branch focuses on extracting more discriminative local detail features. Furthermore, to enhance both the network’s robustness to noise interference and the representational capacity of the features, we design a novel feature fusion module that performs complementary integration of shallow and deep features. Experimental results show that the recognition rates of LRFVNet on the USM and HKPU finger vein datasets reached 99.63% and 99.48% respectively. Compared with other methods, LRFVNet achieves a significant accuracy improvement of up to 68.81% under challenging noise interference and illumination variations, while reducing computational time by approximately 16%. The results demonstrate LRFVNet superior accuracy and robustness, while maintaining its lightweight."

    "abstract": "In high-voltage brushless DC (BLDC) generator systems for aerospace applications, significant coupling exists between the main generator and the excitation subsystem. During operation, this coupling is highly susceptible to variations in temperature and magnetic saturation, resulting in parameter drift that adversely affects the accuracy of impedance modeling, thereby compromising system stability analysis and control performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a frequency-domain impedance modeling and decoupled parameter identification method tailored for strongly coupled high-voltage DC (HVDC) generators. A two-port impedance model is constructed to accurately characterize the dynamic frequency-domain coupling between subsystems. By leveraging impedance sensitivity spectra, a frequency-band decoupling strategy is designed to explicitly identify the characteristic coupling intervals between the main generator and the exciter, thereby enhancing the observability and identifiability of the coupled parameters. To mitigate the degradation in identification accuracy caused by strong multi-parameter coupling, a multi-stage hierarchical identification strategy based on an improved slime mold optimization algorithm is developed. This approach enables hierarchical convergence within the parameter space and facilitates refined local identification. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with conventional identification methods, the proposed strategy reduces the maximum identification error by 7.5% and improves accuracy by 5.2% over other optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the method effectively compensates for parameter drift caused by thermal variations and magnetic saturation, maintaining the output impedance magnitude error within ±2 dB. These results confirm the enhanced accuracy and engineering applicability of the proposed impedance modeling approach for aerospace high-voltage BLDC generator systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a unified framework that jointly predicts behavioral intentions and vectorized occupancy, leveraging them as priors to dynamically prune context information during trajectory decoding, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. While most prior work has focused on boosting the precision of multimodal trajectory prediction, explicit modeling of behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains underexplored. To this end, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy predictions priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves SOTA performance on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the softmAP by 10% compared to the previous SOTA method, BETOP, in Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications."

Moreover, unmodeled dynamics in PAM-actuated parallel robots are unavoidable, which further complicates the efficient tracking task of PAM-actuated parallel robots. Therefore, we propose an output feedback controller with interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks (IT2FNNs) for PAM-actuated parallel robots to obtain satisfactory tracking results. Specifically, compared with most existing methods using the interval type-1 fuzzy neural network (NN), the IT2FNN used is more beneficial for dealing with unmodeled dynamics and system uncertainties on PAM-actuated parallel robots. Meanwhile, considering that most practical systems are often only equipped with displacement/angle sensors and lack velocity sensors, an observer is designed to estimate unmeasurable velocity signals. Next, based on Lyapunov techniques, the convergence of tracking errors is proven through theoretical analysis. To our knowledge, this article is the first to apply IT2FNNs with observation information to PAM-actuated parallel robots with unknown dynamics and unmeasurable velocity signals, and provides rigorous stability analysis. Further, several experiments are implemented, and the corresponding results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller."

    "abstract": "In cine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) reconstruction algorithms often suffer from feature information loss during feature extraction and lack effective mechanisms for feature compensation. These problems can lead to the lack of texture and edge details in the reconstructed image, making it difficult to obtain a clear cardiac image, which will increase the rate of misjudgment of cardiac disease by experts. To address these issues, we propose a U-shaped network with multi-level information compensation (UMIC). Specifically, the network first performs multi-level feature extraction on low-resolution (LR) inputs and reduces channel dimensionality via a downward channel branch. The compressed features are then fused through a bottom module to capture inter-channel dependencies. Finally, the relevant features are recovered and enhanced through an upward channel branch. Additionally, we introduce a multi-level information compensation module to mitigate detail loss incurred during channel compression and to assist in recovering difficult-to-restore LR image details in the reconstruction phase. Extensive experiments show that UMIC achieves better CMRI SR reconstruction performance compared to some state-of-the-art SR methods."

We found the model predicts exotic forestry nationally to a higher level of accuracy than previously achieved. The resulting layer was used to detect and correct missed exotic forest plantations in the current LUCAS LUM.

In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and DeepSeekstyle approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains. VeriRL is publicly available at https://github.com/omniAI-Lab/VeriRL."

    "abstract": "Graph applications, characterized by irregular memory footprints and low branch prediction accuracy, pose significant challenges for modern computing systems. This work examines the performance of state-of-the-art chiplet-based multi-core architectures featuring out-of-order (OoO) cores with deep pipeline components, such as reorder buffers (ROB) and load queues (LQ), when executing graph workloads.Through detailed micro-architectural profiling, we find that OoO cores are often inefficiently utilized. We identify two dominant causes: fake-busy and true-idle. In fake-busy, a core waiting for a branch-resolving load speculatively skips the current branch, enters the next loop, and repeats this process— iteratively issuing a cascade of speculative instructions. In true-idle, a core waiting for a branch-resolving load speculatively executes code of the current branch, where instructions often depend on the branch-resolving load itself, resulting in unproductive pipeline stalls and instructions accumulating in the ROB. Due to high load latency in chiplet architectures and low branch prediction accuracy typical of graph workloads, both scenarios suffer from deep speculation and frequent pipeline squashing, leading to inefficient utilization of OoO pipeline resources.Our results show that halving the ROB and LQ sizes leads to only minor performance degradation—average slowdowns of 4.3% and 1.0%, respectively—across most applications, with the exception of two cases that exhibit more substantial slowdowns of 37.3% (half-ROB) and 5.6% (half-LQ). Moreover, operating at a lower core frequency (e.g., 2.0 GHz) yields an energy-delay product (EDP) comparable to that of higher frequencies (e.g., 2.5 GHz and 3.0 GHz) across all applications. Together, these findings highlight new opportunities for performance and power co-optimization when running graph workloads on chiplet-based multi-core systems."

    "abstract": "Efficiently running deep neural networks requires the hardware acceleration of convolutional kernels. Spatial Architectures (SAs) are a natural fit, employing multiple processing elements and a custom memory hierarchy to exploit parallelism and data reuse. In turn, SAs require a mapping to specify data movements and computation order. Thus, specialized mapping tools have been developed to explore the space of possible mappings and retrieve optimal ones, using analytical hardware models for performance feedback. However, for each SA-kernel pair, the mapping space is vast, with significant performance variations arising from subtle interactions between mapping decisions. Therefore, coordinating all problem aspects remains challenging for existing tools, often leading to long execution times. Yet, high-quality mappings must be promptly available to support downstream tasks, like runtime resource allocation and hardware design space exploration. To address this, we propose QuickFlow, a new mapping tool that efficiently finds near-optimal mappings for SAs and AI kernels. In QuickFlow, we build equivalences between mappings based on a detailed analysis of distinct data reuse opportunities. Then, we redesign the optimization paradigm accordingly, comparing tiling and parallelism decisions after quickly selecting their best dataflow up to equivalence, ultimately enabling a single greedy local search to effectively reach near-optimal mappings. QuickFlow also integrates an improved analytical model, supporting arbitrary convolutions through a novel, exact formula for tile sizes. Across our experiments on three SAs and twenty kernels, QuickFlow achieves a 1–2.1× better energy-delay product and up to 182× faster execution time compared to the best results from four state-of-the-art mapping tools."

    "abstract": "The State Space Model (SSM), particularly the Mamba implementation, has demonstrated impressive capabilities across various domains. It offers a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to Transformers while achieving higher algorithm accuracy. However, the ineffectiveness of spatially unfolding the SSM layer leads to increased latency as sentence length grows, especially when being deployed on FPGA. Previous token reduction methods introduced in Transformers fail to maintain high performance in Mamba. Moreover, the dispersed outliers, complex model structure and variety of non-linear operators obstruct its efficient implementation on FPGA. To address these challenges, we propose ToMamba, the first algorithm-architecture co-design to optimize Mamba implementation. At the algorithmic level, ToMamba incorporates a novel progressive token merging algorithm with minimal hardware consumption and a hardware-aware fine-grained quantization strategy. On the hardware side, a dualflow systolic array is designed to unify convolution and matrix multiplication, supporting both weight stationary and output stationary dataflow. A fine-grained pipeline design is adopted for SSM computation to maximize hardware efficiency and enhance throughput. Furthermore, efficient hardware architecture and approximation method for nonlinear function units are proposed. To enable merging after the Mamba layer, ToMamba also adopts a dedicated data mapping scheme. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the token reduction method of ToMamba achieves 10% sparsity with only 0.25% accuracy loss, improving up to 16.89% in accuracy compared to previous methods. ToMamba hardware implementation on U280 FPGA achieves up to 636.00×/11.01×/1.39× speedup compared to Intel Xeon Platinum 8369B CPU, NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU and ASIC platforms and 1280×/44.32× energy efficiency improvement compared to CPU and GPU platforms."

Printed Electronics (PE), offering advantages of ultra-low cost fabrication and mechanical flexibility, present a viable platform to realize such neuromorphic systems at scale. However, designing adaptable and efficient spiking circuits that meet the unique constraints of PE applications remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a novel analog spiking neuromorphic circuit with a learnable spike generator (LSG). Unlike fixed-threshold models, our generator adapts spike timing dynamics during training, enabling better task-specific performance. To optimize for ultra-low power consumption on resource-constrained platforms, we further introduce a robustness-aware training framework that further minimizes the energy consumption adaptively. Simulation results across 13 benchmarks demonstrate an average 57.6% power reduction for the LSG while improving the average classification accuracy by 8%, area and energy reduction by 89% and 28.7% respectively compared to the state-of-the-art printed analog spiking neural networks (P-SNNs)."

    "abstract": "The success of foundation AI has motivated the research of circuit foundation models, which are customized to assist the integrated circuit (IC) design process. However, existing pre-trained circuit foundation models are typically limited to standalone encoders for predictive tasks or decoders for generative tasks. These two model types are developed independently, operate on different circuit modalities, and reside in separate latent spaces. This restricts their ability to complement each other for more advanced capabilities. In this work, we present GenEDA, the first framework that cross-modally aligns circuit encoders with decoders within a shared latent space. GenEDA bridges the gap between graph-based circuit representation learning and text-based large language models (LLMs), enabling communication between their respective latent spaces. To achieve the alignment, we propose two paradigms to support both open-source trainable LLMs and commercial frozen LLMs. We leverage this aligned architecture to develop the first generative foundation model for netlists, unleashing LLMs’ generative reasoning capability on the low-level and bit-blasted netlists. GenEDA enables three unprecedented generative netlist functional reasoning tasks, where it reversely generates high-level functionalities such as specifications and RTL code from low-level netlists. These tasks move beyond traditional gate function classification to direct generation of full-circuit functionality. Experiments demonstrate that GenEDA significantly boosts advanced LLMs’ (e.g., GPT and DeepSeek series) performance in all tasks."

    "abstract": "The escalating carbon emissions driven by the growing computational demands of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made energy-efficient and sustainable hardware design a high priority. Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution, delivering orders of magnitude higher throughput and energy efficiency than CMOS for deep neural network inferences, thereby lowering operational carbon. However, studies have shown that the carbon emission from manufacturing, i.e., embodied carbon, constitutes a substantial and often dominant portion of the total carbon footprint of a computing system. Hence, it is crucial to consider both operational and embodied carbon to determine the true benefits of photonic computing. While the embodied carbon of CMOS chips and CMOS-based systems has been studied extensively, there is currently no model available for estimating the embodied carbon of photonic chips.In this work, we develop the first-ever model to estimate the embodied carbon of photonic chips. Our findings show that photonic chips can reduce the embodied carbon of computing systems with at least 4.1× less fabrication energy and significantly higher yield than CMOS. Building on our model, we introduce EPiCarbon, an open-source tool to evaluate the carbon footprint of Electro-Photonic (EPiC) accelerators, incorporating both operational and embodied carbon. Using EPiCarbon, we analyze the carbon footprint of state-of-the-art EPiC accelerators, demonstrating their potential as carbon-sustainable solutions for computationally demanding AI applications. Finally, through a case study on a comprehensive EPiC accelerator, ADEPT, we demonstrate key strategies to further reduce the carbon footprint of EPiC accelerators, guiding future sustainable hardware design."

However, existing file systems are inefficient in metadata management, synchronization efficiency, and system scalability under high-concurrency and metadata-intensive workloads in cross-domain environments. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CrossFS (CFS), a cross-domain distributed file system that enhances consistency guarantees and metadata indexing. Specifically, CFS leverages conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to synchronize metadata, achieving strong eventual consistency with minimal synchronization overhead, even across network partitions. Furthermore, CFS employs a Hybrid Tree indexing structure, tailored for distributed environments, which optimizes metadata operations by reducing query latency by up to 33.4% and write amplification by 30.7%. Additionally, CFS achieves adaptive caching strategies and a hybrid synchronization model that effectively balances consistency latency with data availability. Extensive evaluations show that CFS outperforms CephFS and GlusterFS, achieving up to 33.9% higher metadata throughput, 36% lower latency, and 42% better data operation efficiency."

However, existing models struggle with scenarios where only aggregate power sequences are available in the target domain without any individual appliance labels for fine-tuning (i.e., zero-shot), which causes significant performance degradation and limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model named contrastive learning-based multiscale dual-path temporal fusion network (CL-MDTFN). CL-MDTFN integrates an energy-aware subsampling embedding block for multiscale feature extraction and a residual power decoupling block for capturing both fine-grained transient activities and overarching load trends. By leveraging the autocorrelation contrastive loss, CL-MDTFN effectively learns the long-term variations of the signals, enabling accurate load disaggregation in unlabeled households. Experiments on U.K.-DALE and REDD demonstrate that CL-MDTFN outperforms existing NILM models in fully labeled and unlabeled scenarios."

The system combines an automated optical microscopy device and an AWS cloud server. The device, built with CNC system components (stepper motors and linear guides), automatically images the lower region of multiwell plates, overcoming visualization challenges such worm aggregates and media turbidity. The captured images are automatically sent to a cloud database, where a computer vision algorithm based on the YOLOv8m architecture is executed for phenotypic analysis and nematode mortality classification. Despite considerable blur in the images, the trained model achieved excellent performance, with all metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score, mAP@50 and mAP@50:95) exceeding 86.0%, combined with an inference speed of 33.2 frames per second. The decentralized architecture allows a single AWS server to manage the processing of multiple distributed devices, reducing operational costs. The solution offers remote operation via a browser, facilitating collaborative analysis, data storage, and the exchange of results between geographically dispersed laboratories.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the task scheduling problem for cooperative computation in a multi-UAV edge computing system. The problem is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming problem with an objective to maximize the average number of computation tasks successfully processed in each time slot. To solve the formulated problem using a reinforcement learning method, the problem is first reformulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and transformed into an average-reward maximization problem. Then, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based task scheduling algorithm (MTS) is proposed to solve the transformed problem. The proposed MTS algorithm introduces a QMIX-based training framework, in which the local policies of all agents are jointly trained by a central controller in a centralized manner and each agent executes actions independently according to its local observation and local policy in a decentralized manner. Moreover, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are also introduced to deal with the partial observability of POMDP. Using the proposed MTS algorithm, each UAV is able to make optimal scheduling decisions independently to enable efficient cooperative computation between UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MTS algorithm can achieve better performance than benchmark algorithms in terms of the number of tasks successfully processed in the system."

This study introduces a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that leverages machine learning (ML) models to optimize laser irradiation parameters and solder compositions for improved mechanical performance. A dataset of 400 experiments, compiled from 45 independent studies, was used to train and evaluate several regression models, including linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and ensemble approaches such as random forest and gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM). The XGBoost model outperformed others, achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of $19 \\%$ and $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.93 in predicting tensile strength. The model’s predictions were validated through controlled ex vivo experiments on porcine skin and bovine arteries, and in vivo trials on rabbit dermal incisions. This CDSS enables personalized parameter selection for LTS procedures and presents a pathway to clinical integration of AI-driven laser microsurgery."

This technology expands the space of informative parameters in the speech signal, incorporating time, frequency, and amplitude characteristics. It is based on the principle that each new combined signal reflects hidden structural features in the original data, such as non-linear modulations and energy localization areas. The results of testing this technology have shown its potential for improving speech signal processing tasks, including filtering, segmentation, and extraction of informative parameters. The developed technology opens up new possibilities for analyzing speech signals, combining high accuracy with the ability to adapt to non-stationary conditions. This technology can be the basis for creating systems that classify emotions, filter speech, and diagnose speech pathologies."

The results show that the S25 cathode material has a relatively high noise level, while it has high sensitivity which is beneficial to the corresponding EBAPS devices obtaining better imaging quality in low-light environment. In contrast, although the S20 cathode material has a lower noise level, its sensitivity is poor, which limits the imaging capability of the corresponding EBAPS devices under extremely low-light conditions. Their imaging capability is slightly inferior to that of the EBAPS devices based on the S25 cathode material. Therefore, the selection of cathode materials has a significant impact on the performance of EBAPS devices. EBAPS devices with corresponding characteristics can be developed through optimization of cathode material selection to meet the low-light imaging requirements of different application scenarios."

Since executing test cases on logic synthesis tools often requires significant cost on complicated synthesis and simulation, fault-triggering test cases should be prioritized to execute. However, existing prioritization methods face challenges in accurately predicting the fault-triggering capability of dynamically generated test cases and modeling the unique syntactic and structure complexities of these HDL-based programs. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Therefore, we propose ProFuse, a multi-dimensional feature fusion method for logic synthesis tool test case prioritization.

These features are processed by a joint model of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to rank fault-triggering test cases accurately. ProFuse achieves an Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD) score of 0.9285, outperforming the state-of-the-art prioritization methods by 11.38% to 82.49%.

Furthermore, a less conservative loop functional, whose positive definiteness in rest mode is no longer required, is constructed innovatively. Then, some new sufficient criteria for synchronization and its codesign algorithm for controller gain are given successively. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the synchronization outcomes obtained in this paper."

    "abstract": "Catheter insertion is a standard procedure in cardiovascular interventions. However, conventional catheters lack distal dexterity, making precise tip steering challenging in tortuous vessels. This limitation results in increased risk of vascular injury and considerable procedural complexity. In addition, current interventional procedures remain manually operated by surgeons under X-ray fluoroscopy, exposing surgeons to prolonged radiation and posing occupational health risks. Although several steerable catheter systems have demonstrated preliminary feasibility in interventional applications, current systems remain inadequate to satisfy the rigorous safety requirements and long-range navigation needs of cardiovascular interventions. To address these challenges, we present an innovative robotized steerable catheter system specifically designed for long-range cardiovascular interventions, achieving several key advancements. Firstly, we propose a slender steerable catheter based on the concentric push-pull robot, enabling precise tip bending during intervention. Secondly, the catheter’s three degrees of freedom (tip bending, reciprocal delivery, and rotation) are realized through a compact actuation unit combined with a corresponding control strategy, and operated via a joystick to facilitate intuitive remote operation. Thirdly, a force sensor whose signals are preprocessed and fed into a deep learning model for correction is integrated at the clamping module, which provides force feedback for enhanced safety. Furthermore, quantitative experiments assessed the reliability of the bending angle regulation approach and the effectiveness of the force feedback correction method. Ultimately, multi-scenario interventional experiments validated the system’s superior dexterity, operational stability, and significant potential for clinical application in cardiovascular interventions."

    "abstract": "Designing and validating efficient cache-coherent memory subsystems is a critical yet complex task in the development of modern multi-core system-on-chip architectures. Rhea is a unified framework that streamlines the design and system-level validation of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystems. On the design side, Rhea generates synthesizable, highly configurable RTL supporting various architectural parameters. On the validation side, Rhea integrates Verilator’s cycle-accurate RTL simulation with gem5’s full-system simulation, allowing realistic workloads and operating systems to run alongside the actual RTL under test. We apply Rhea to design MSI-based RTL memory subsystems with one and two levels of private caches and scaling up to sixteen cores. Their evaluation with 22 applications from state-of-the-art benchmark suites shows intermediate performance relative to gem5 Ruby’s MI and MOESI models. The hybrid gem5-Verilator co-simulation flow incurs a moderate simulation overhead, up to 2.7 times compared to gem5 MI, but achieves higher fidelity by simulating real RTL hardware. This overhead decreases with scale, down to 1.6 times in sixteen-core scenarios. These results demonstrate Rhea’s effectiveness and scalability in enabling fast development of RTL cache-coherent memory subsystem designs."

Embedding and extraction modules are integrated into a Flask-based application. A minimal perturbation is computed and added to the cover image, enabling fixed decoder networks, initialized with receiver-specific seeds, to recover their respective messages. A practical key management scheme stores seeds and the compressed perturbation in a serialized Pickle file.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for ECG signal classification have emerged as powerful tools for achieving accurate medical diagnoses. However, the supervised training of such models typically requires large, well-annotated, and balanced datasets, which are often challenging to obtain. These limitations can be mitigated through semi-supervised learning approaches that leverage partially labelled datasets. Despite their potential, semi-supervised methods face the risk of incorrectly interpreting unlabelled examples during the training process, or a lack of diversity for the labelled data, which can compromise model performance. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised method that combines self-labelling and consistency regularisation for a more refined selection of unlabelled data at each training iteration, thereby reducing the likelihood of ineffective training. The approach does not require a pretrained teacher model and introduces a refined consistency regularisation mechanism that integrates both the model’s predictions and the corresponding gradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) visualisations. The method is evaluated on patient-independent models using data merged from diverse ECG datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined use of self-labelling and consistency regularisation enhances classification accuracy by leveraging noise injection from consistency regularisation and labelling reliability provided by proxy-based classification."

    "abstract": "In recent years, medical devices utilizing soft robotic solutions have gained popularity for small, minimally invasive, and complex procedures. Another critical category is represented by prostheses and recovery devices, mainly implemented using small servomotors and complex mechanical assemblies. Soft-Actuated prostheses are needed for safer and more elastic prosthetic devices and wearable technologies. In these cases, a classical control solution, using a computational unit with limited speed, becomes rigid and uncomfortable. Furthermore, most procedures require a calibration process, numerical evaluation, and rigorous testing before they can be used. The solution proposed in this research is based on a hardware spiking neural network that can control the bending motion of a soft hybrid actuator. The bending is considered according to a natural finger flexing, commanded by the human neural system through small electrical signals closer to the network behavior. The solution offers a promising response speed, not limited by a digital frequency or numerical determinism. Furthermore, the solution offers out-of-the-box functionality, eliminating the need for additional setup. This research is sustained by experimental results guided by a novel design in controlling the motion of hybrid soft actuators."

Traditional processors struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing (ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral library search, achieving 43× speedup and 21× higher energy efficiency over state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy."

DirectFuzz addresses this with directed test generation but suffers from key limitations, including limited HDL support, abstraction mismatches, and poor scalability for large target regions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we propose PROFUZZ, a Directed Graybox Fuzzing (DGF) framework that integrates Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for precise and scalable seed generation. By leveraging ATPG’s structural analysis capabilities, PROFUZZ improves coverage effectiveness and supports large-scale hardware designs. Experimental results show that PROFUZZ outperforms DirectFuzz with 30× greater scalability in terms of handling target sites, 11.66% higher coverage, and 2.76× faster execution, demonstrating its potential to advance the state-of-the-art in directed hardware fuzzing."

The proposed attack bypasses the first-order masking when only applied during matrix multiplication and addition in FrodoKEM. This is achieved by using specially crafted inputs, enabling direct first-order correlations with the secret key. We experimentally demonstrate the successful recovery of rows of the secret matrix S on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA implementation of the design. The results show that, using correlation power analysis with crafted inputs and no more than 10,000 traces, we can break the claimed resistance with our first-order attack. These findings highlight caveats in the application of current masking techniques to post-quantum cryptographic hardware and emphasize the need for more robust countermeasures."

This paper presents Belenos, a comprehensive workload characterization of finite element biomechanics using FEBio, a widely adopted simulator, gem5 sensitivity studies, and VTune analysis. VTune results reveal that smaller workloads experience moderate front-end stalls, typically around 13.1%, whereas larger workloads are dominated by significant backend bottlenecks, with backend-bound cycles ranging from 59.9% to over 82.2%.

However, the extensive search space and high computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on accelerator-specific architecture.

    "abstract": "Modern cloud computing has witnessed a growing trend of leveraging hardware accelerators, such as FPGAs, to boost the performance of computation-intensive workloads. Further, FPGA virtualization has been adopted to improve the efficiency and utilization of FPGA resources in the cloud. However, the security of user data and computation becomes a major concern of the virtualized FPGA cloud services, especially considering the state-of-the-art hardware-based system security technique, namely trusted execution environment (TEE)-enabled confidential computing, does not support FPGAs in the cloud. In this paper, we develop FPGA-CC, an end-to-end confidential container framework designed for virtualized cloud FPGAs. FPGA-CC establishes a secure path between the virtualized FPGA resources and the TEE-based CPU container to accomplish the security objectives concerning virtual FPGA instances. Our experiments on real hardware and various benchmark applications demonstrate that FPGA-CC achieves high security with acceptable performance overhead."

    "abstract": "Power estimation for customized accelerators, especially those derived from high-level programming languages, entails the invocation of a long electronic design automation (EDA) tool chain, thus incurring large timing overhead that hinders early design optimization. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose HIPPO, an architecture-level power modeling framework for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). HIPPO operates directly on C/C++ programs, whose execution is prior to and independent of any EDA tool including the very front-end, high-level synthesis (HLS). During power modeling, HIPPO exploits the intrinsic C/C++ code hierarchies, including nested loops and operations, and enables multi-level power estimation that aligns with different code hierarchies. Specifically, HIPPO can be decomposed into (1) a code transformation flow that directly converts a C/C++ program with HLS pragmas into hardware-oriented and power-aware control and dataflow graph, (2) a hierarchy-preserving power modeling methodology that combines analytical modeling and data-driven learning approaches to effectively orchestrate different code hierarchies, and (3) an adaptive dataflow coarsening strategy which ensures modeling accuracy, efficiency and robustness by suppressing noise of onboard measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that HIPPO effectively decomposes and accurately predicts both dynamic and total power consumption, achieving average errors of 8.89% (dynamic) and 6.31% (total) for nested loops, and 9.86% (dynamic) and 3.41% (total) for single loops, respectively. These results prove that HIPPO paves the way for power-efficient high-level architecture exploration."

However, the large parameter sizes of LLMs pose significant challenges in deployment on resource-constrained devices, affecting user experience. Mobile DRAM typically cannot accommodate these parameters, necessitating the use of NAND flash memory, but it has considerably slower access speeds. To overcome the limitations, we propose LLM-on-the-Palm, an LLM inference system for smartphones that leverages Processing-in-Memory (PIM)-enhanced NAND flash memory to enable fast inference of billion-parameter LLMs with minimal hardware modifications. Our approach requires only a single multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit per plane in a NAND flash memory - 256 MAC units for 256 GB SSD - without compromising cell density. Simulation results show that our design achieves ∼100 ms per token generation on a 6.7B model under specifications similar to an iPhone-15."

We study dense transformer-based models as representative examples of contemporary architectures widely used in operational deployments. Our work combines detailed profiling measurements with predictive analytical models to characterize communication behavior across different parallelization configurations. Results show that tensor parallelism incurs substantial network overhead but delivers superior response times for brief sequences, pipeline parallelism minimizes data transfer requirements while increasing total latency, and combined approaches demand careful tuning to achieve balanced performance. These insights offer practical recommendations for selecting appropriate parallelization schemes in production LLM services and identify key opportunities for optimizing inference frameworks and communication infrastructure."

In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates AllSAT-based pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to tackle this challenge efficiently. Our method first employs an AllSAT formulation that incorporates routing constraints and layout heuristics to exhaustively enumerate only the legal and promising placement solutions. This dramatically reduces the solution space while preserving high-quality candidates. We then apply a guided MCTS algorithm to explore the reduced space and identify optimal or near-optimal placements under given objectives such as total wire length (TWL). Experimental results on a diverse set of standard cells demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The AllSAT filtering improves average solution routability from 1.1% to 62.7%, while reducing the total placement space by over 99.9%. On top of that, our MCTS achieves a 62.2× runtime speedup over brute-force exploration, with only a 0.2% degradation in TWL quality. These results confirm that our AllSAT+MCTS framework offers a scalable and practical solution for high-quality standard cell layout synthesis."

    "abstract": "For reliability-critical silicon systems, transient errors caused by cosmic rays necessitate comprehensive and efficient reliability analysis before product deployment. Fault injection (FI) serves as a cost-effective alternative to expensive irradiation experiments for evaluating system robustness. However, simulation-based FI is constrained by the performance of the underlying hardware platform, making it impractical for large-scale designs, where achieving high fault coverage can take months or even years. Furthermore, most transient errors have no impact on system functionality, and filtering out these insignificant errors in advance can significantly enhance the efficiency of reliability analysis. To address these challenges, we propose Tenpura, a fault evaluation platform designed for ultra-fast reliability analysis. In Tenpura, a transient fault scope narrowing method is introduced to narrow the FI scope via the proposed scan-based activity tracing flow, further optimizing fault analysis and improving overall efficiency. By leveraging FPGA emulation and scan chain-based fault analysis at the pre-silicon stage, Tenpura achieves high-efficiency fault reduction (88.49–96.26% across three design under tests (DUTs) including RISC-V cores and NVDLA-based AI accelerator) within one month, delivering over an order of magnitude faster fault analysis compared to SOTA methods."

    "abstract": "Wavelength-routed optical networks-on-chip (WRONoC) is a promising solution for achieving high-bandwidth, low-power on-chip communications. Previous work has aimed to reduce transmission latency in WRONoC by bandwidth allocation considering application communication demands. This is achieved by optimizing core-to-port mapping and configuring the radii of microring resonators (MRRs), which are the key routing components in WRONoC. However, previous work suffers from slow runtime and limited solution quality and fails to obtain feasible solutions for large applications given WRONoC topology. To address these, we propose a novel graph-based approach, FAB, to fast and efficiently reduce transmission latency in WRONoC. Specifically, we formulate core-to-port mapping and MRR radii configuration as two-stage weighted subgraph matching problems. In each stage, we construct graphs to model the demands or the bandwidth potential between vertices. By introducing strict weight-based matching strategies and progressively relaxing infeasible cases, FAB can quickly achieve optimized high-quality solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that FAB reduces worst-case transmission latency by up to 87.5% and accelerates optimization by up to 500,000× compared to the state-of-the-art method."

Maximum entropy RL methods typically generate a robust policy with entropy augmented reward. While incorporating entropy into the reward offers the benefit of exploration, it presents limited universal applicability and persistent convergence difficulties, such as suboptimal policy stabilization and unstable <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$Q$</tex-math> </inline-formula> value update.

We thus introduce a beta-symmetric Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence objective to mitigate such issues under the maximum entropy framework. With this objective function, the tremulous nature of the policy could be controlled with a large beta value.

This study investigates the impact of shift-angle topologies in PCB-embedded solenoid inductors, focusing on minimizing electromagnetic losses to enhance high-frequency performance for applications such as compact DC/DC converters and power modules. Four angular configurations were analyzed, assessing how different trace alignments influence flux distribution, eddy current generation, and inductance behavior. To isolate the effects of angle shift, the study employed Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations under direct current (DC) excitation, eliminating the influence of skin effect, proximity effect, core loss, and parasitic capacitance. Results showed that modifying the shift angle significantly altered flux density-especially the perpendicular (Z) component responsible for eddy current formation. Among the DC-tested topologies, Configurations with two counter wise angles in the coils top-layer and bottom-layer traces demonstrated the lowest flux loss and minimal eddy current dissipation. Experimental validation confirmed the simulation findings, with electromagnetic losses within a 6% margin. Tests under alternating current (AC) conditions using an impedance analyzer verified the benefits of reverse angle configurations but revealed that the angle position affects the resonance frequency."

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques. However, traditional DA methods usually require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data due to the privacy issue. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

Existing event-triggered fault-tolerant (ETFT) control algorithms encounter significant challenges when simultaneously addressing three critical issues: stochastic actuator failure factors, continuous communication requirements, and dependence on global information. These challenges stem from the complex coupling relationships among nonlinear adaptive parameters, heterogeneous stochastic multiplicative failure factors of actuators, and combined measurement errors. To tackle these challenges, we propose novel ETFT protocols based on nonsmooth/smooth frameworks. The key features of the proposed protocols are as follows: First, these protocols can operate under stochastic actuator failure conditions without requiring prior knowledge of failure factor characteristics, including their range, frequency, or type (e.g., constant, time-varying, stochastic, or periodic). Second, both data communication and controller updates are event-triggered based on pre-specified conditions, which significantly reduces unnecessary transmissions and computational burden. Third, these protocols are fully distributed and scalable, completely eliminating the dependence on global network topology information, thereby enhancing system autonomy and practical applicability. Numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

This paper investigates FDA-assisted satellite covert communication. By considering covertness constraints based on average Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, frequency offset limitations, and power budget, we jointly optimize the satellite transmit power and FDA element frequency offsets to simultaneously maximize the time-varying covert rate and minimize the time-varying covert angle. To address practical channel dynamics, we develop a stochastic channel model incorporating Doppler compensation and channel aging effect mitigation for the FDA scheme. Closed-form and approximate expressions for the beam peak angle and half-power beamwidth (HPBW) with respect to frequency offsets are derived and analytically verified. The principle of linear uniform FDA frequency offset interval is established, with covertness quantified through KL divergence, enabling an optimized FDA frequency offset design from an angular perspective. To solve it, an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the interception probability is improved, and the proposed dynamic FDA algorithm exhibits better covert performance than other DRL-based methods."

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the visualization literacy of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a novel prompting technique called Charts-of-Thought. We tested three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-3.7-sonnet, GPT-4.5-preview, and Gemini-2.0-pro) on the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) using standard prompts and our structured approach. The Charts-of-Thought method guides LLMs through a systematic data extraction, verification, and analysis process before answering visualization questions. Our results show Claude-3.7-sonnet achieved a score of 50.17 using this method, far exceeding the human baseline of 28.82. This approach improved performance across all models, with score increases of 21.8% for GPT-4.5, 9.4% for Gemini-2.0, and 13.5% for Claude-3.7 compared to standard prompting. The performance gains were consistent across original and modified VLAT charts, with Claude correctly answering 100% of questions for several chart types that previously challenged LLMs. Our study reveals that modern multimodal LLMs can surpass human performance on visualization literacy tasks when given the proper analytical framework. These findings establish a new benchmark for LLM visualization literacy and demonstrate the importance of structured prompting strategies for complex visual interpretation tasks. Beyond improving LLM visualization literacy, Charts-of-Thought could also enhance the accessibility of visualizations, potentially benefiting individuals with visual impairments or lower visualization literacy."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a miniaturized, circularly polarized (CP), triple-band, MIMO implantable antenna for wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) and deep tissue applications in an internet of medical things (IoMT) scenario. The dual-port MIMO antenna has a compact volume of 9.6 × 5 × 0.254 mm3 achieved by using spiral meandered line resonators without relying on shortening vias or ground plane slots. The presented MIMO antenna operates in the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) band (402–406 MHz), the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands (433.05–434.79 MHz, 902–928 MHz), and the midfield band (1315-1371 MHz). The MIMO antenna supports multitask operation, such as high-rate data transmission, control signalling, and wireless power transfer (WPT) simultaneously. A thorough simulation process was adopted to optimize the proposed MIMO antenna by integrating it inside capsule-type and flat-type implantable medical devices (IMDs) and placing it inside various homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms. The MIMO antenna was fabricated and tested by placing it inside minced pork to evaluate various parameters, which were found to be in close agreement with the simulated ones. The presented MIMO antenna exhibits a measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth of 71 MHz, 70 MHz, and 61 MHz and measured peak gains of -47.21, -38.13, and -33.28 dBi at 433, 915, and 1345 MHz, respectively. The proposed antenna is the first to simultaneously achieve miniaturization, circular polarization, and triple-band MIMO operation (402/433, 915, and 1345 MHz) in an ultra-compact form factor. It maintains SAR compliance, provides sufficient link margin at implantation depths, and enables reliable IoMT communication and wireless power transfer."

    "abstract": "Microfluidic devices have become essential in biochemical and medical research, enabling high-throughput experimentation on compact and cost-effective platforms. However, the design and realization of microfluidic devices is a manual, tedious, and error-prone task. Additionally, multiple iterations for prototyping are often needed until a physical realization works as intended. Accordingly, methods for the automatic design and simulation of microfluidic devices are key—something that is standard in the design of conventional circuits and systems. In this work, we present the Munich Microfluidics Toolkit (MMFT), an open-source toolkit that provides corresponding tools for automating the design and simulation of microfluidic systems. For selected design tasks—such as the generation of meanders, gradient generators, organs-on-chip layouts, as well as ISO-compliant routing and validation—we showcase corresponding tools and provide an overview of simulators for microfluidics. MMFT helps researchers and engineers to design microfluidic devices in an automatic fashion (often with the click of a button) and to validate them through simulation across different abstraction levels.

The sensing and computation being tightly coupled in the in-sensor devices help in low-latency and energy-efficient data processing. This paradigm introduces a novel security front, exposing vulnerabilities in both neuromorphic hardware and the temporally sparse spike encodings to a variety of emerging attack modalities. This survey offers a comprehensive examination of the security and robustness landscape for SNNs deployed in in-sensor computing environments. It begins by outlining the architectural and algorithmic characteristics that define in-sensor SNN pipelines, with particular focus on temporal coding, asynchronous processing, and hardware constraints. We then review pertinent threat models, including spike-level adversarial perturbations, sensor spoofing, electromagnetic interference, fault injection, and timing-based privacy leakage, considering both white-box and black-box attack scenarios that exploit spatiotemporal vulnerabilities. Existing defense mechanisms, spanning noise shaping, homeostatic control, adversarial training, secure spike encoding, and hardware-level protections, are systematically categorized and assessed in the context of resource-constrained, event-driven platforms. Finally, we highlight emerging research directions in secure neuromorphic learning, such as continual and federated SNN training under adversarial settings, establishing a foundation for advancing the research in secure neuromorphic systems."

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability parameters are widely used for assessment of cardiovascular and regulatory system status. Initial data for heart rate variability estimation could be taken from various types of devices that provide different quality of the data. It is important to understand how the initial data parameters impact the results. The purpose if the study is to assess the stability of the statistical parameters of heart rate variability, regardless of the device from which the signal was taken. The tasks of the research are obtaining RR intervals from an ECG signal with an initially specified sampling rate; artificially reduced to obtain multiple datasets for further comparison, simulating data acquisition from different devices; estimate the parameters using three well known methods and to compare the results. This allows to evaluate the sensitivity of the methods to the ECG sampling rate. The comparison will help to understand which method is more reliable when changing the sampling rate. ECG signals were taken from Physio.net database. Proposed solution includes testing the stability of the parameters calculated in several ways: the standard method, with the replacement of cardio intervals by absolute increments, and the method with the calculation of indicators in relative values. The double sample rate reducing was chosen as an imitation of lowering the sampling frequency. The results were graphically presented and they show that generally sampling rates 500 Hz and higher are preferable."

The proposed architecture integrates blockchain technology, dynamic non-fungible tokens (dNFTs), and artificial intelligence to establish a verifiable and learner-centric educational ecosystem. Decentralized storage is handled via InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), secured through hybrid encryption and controlled access, ensuring that sensitive data such as assessments and performance records remain both confidential and tamper-proof.A distinctive feature of the platform is the use of dynamic dNFTs to represent and continuously update each learner’s academic progress. Unlike static certificates, these credentials evolve as students complete assessments and advance through course material, offering a transparent and verifiable record of learning achievements anchored on the blockchain. Each dNFT encodes metadata such as course names, skill levels, and timestamps, ensuring long-term integrity and resistance to tampering. Complemented by an AI module for personalized test generation, this model replaces traditional certification with an adaptive, decentralized alternative that enhances trust, autonomy, and credential portability across educational and professional domains."

The design relies exclusively on SRAM blocks for storage, completely eliminating FIFOs and intermediate buffers, while flip-flops are used only in timing-critical paths to achieve high-frequency operation with minimal area overhead. Among all known ASIC implementations, our architecture achieves the best normalized area-time product across all ML-KEM parameter sets, demonstrating efficiency and scalability, while also delivering the lowest power and energy per operation among state-of-the-art solutions.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address this limitation, a novel spatial–channel attention-based network, namely SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using four-channel CYGNSS data. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted on CYGNSS-ERA5 test set, SCAWaveNet achieves an average RMSE of 0.438 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces RMSE by at least 3.52%. Furthermore, evaluations on WW3, Jason-3, and NDBC buoy data, as well as in wind speed, rainstorm, typhoon and noisy scenarios, further confirm the superiority of SCAWaveNet.

Herein, we suggest methodologies for collecting large emotional body movement data under three factors for bodily AER dataset construction: participant expertise, motion capture devices, and emotional stimuli, and compared classification accuracy using machine learning and deep learning such as convolutional neural networks, graph convolutional networks, long short-term memory and Transformer. The first study suggests that the models trained using the non-actor dataset performed better than the other model. The second study suggests that the models trained using both marker-based-MoCap and pose-estimation performed better than Kinect-MoCap and mobile-MoCap. The third study suggests that training with both word and video stimuli performed better than picture stimuli. Considering the emotion classification accuracy and accessibility, we recommend gathering bodily AER dataset using non-actors, pose-estimation, and using either word or video stimuli. The current findings may contribute to future research methodologies for bodily emotion recognition."

    "abstract": "Pressure ulcers or bedsores are a common health challenge among immobile patients, often leading to severe complications if not addressed promptly. The existing solutions mostly rely on direct contact and inconvenient methods that lack effective and privacy-preserving systems suitable for continuous monitoring. Furthermore, these methods frequently fail to provide accurate posture detection necessary for early intervention. This study addresses these limitations by introducing a non-contact and privacy-respecting solution that harnesses the capabilities of Wireless Channel State Information (WCSI) sensing by exploiting the Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The proposed system aims to detect patient postures intelligently, contributing to bedsores while ensuring privacy and comfort with improved accuracy. The WCSI represents various human postures by conducting multiple experiments in a controlled lab environment. Advanced signal processing techniques are applied to clean the collected dataset and extract the prominent posture patterns. An intelligent sensing system is developed using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for classifying different postures to prevent bedsores. The developed ML and DL models were evaluated on a dataset prepared from the sensing system. The results indicate a trade-off between various performance metrics and computational efficiency. Among ML algorithms, the Fine Gaussian Support Vector Machine (FGSVM) outperforms others with the highest accuracy of 99.84%, indicating its reliability. While using DL algorithms, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) achieves the highest accuracy of 99.98%. The finding suggests ML models are ideal for computationally constrained scenarios, while DL models have high accuracy, and thus highlights the intelligent sensing system’s potential to mitigate pressure ulcers effectively."

The far-field impedance elements are computed on demand, which significantly reduces memory consumption. To avoid the repeated point-by-point frequency sweep, the Asymptotic Waveform Evaluation (AWE) technique is integrated into the framework. This approach eliminates the need to store high-order derivatives and further enhances computational efficiency. Additionally, the application of Padé approximation extends the fitting bandwidth.

    "abstract": "With the worsening of air pollution, the variety of airborne pollutants has significantly increased. Accurate monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere requires sensors with enhanced precision. If suspended particles in the airflow can be pre-sorted using microfluidic chips, the performance of most existing microfluidic PM detection systems could be significantly improved. In this study, a T-type optofluidic chip (TOPC) for particle sorting and collection was theoretically designed based on optical principles, and an analytical solution for the particle offset distance within the TOPC was derived. Building upon this, a dimensionless parameter S was introduced by incorporating characteristic parameters of the microfluidic chip to describe particle motion within the TOPC. Particle trajectories under varying conditions were calculated using numerical simulations and compared with theoretical predictions to validate the model. In parallel, an experimental platform was constructed. The results demonstrated that the particle offset errors were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.2\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m when compared with the theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, respectively.

    "abstract": "Vision analysis tasks often experience substantial performance drops when processing images captured in lowlight environments. Existing approaches introduce infrared images to provide complementary information, and fusion strategies are consequently developed to combine the advantages of visible light images and infrared images. While fusion methods are typically designed to enhance visual quality with the expectation of improving task performance, many existing approaches tend to overemphasize perceptual fidelity, which can inadvertently compromise task-specific feature. To address this issue, we propose a task-driven hierarchical fusion (TDHF) framework designed to retain task-relevant information throughout the fusion process. Specifically, TDHF adopts a multi-scale hierarchical architecture to capture rich feature representations and incorporates a multi-head attention mechanism to model cross-modal interactions. In addition, we introduce a single-step denoising generation module that guides the fusion of infrared edge features and texture details from low-light images progressively. This process ultimately reconstructs the task-critical Y channel in the YCrCb color space. Extensive experiments on object detection under low-light conditions across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that TDHF effectively enhances task performance, achieving up to 1.1% higher mAP on LLVIP and 1.3% higher mAP on FLIR compared with state-of-the-art methods, without relying on excessive optimization of image quality (PSNR)."

These interactions produce significant EM forces on the magnets and support structures, leading to complex mechanical responses. Strain gauges and displacement sensors installed on the magnet system are used to monitor this behavior. By analyzing the measured data, the structural safety and stability of the system can be evaluated and managed. Over the past three years, the mechanical behavior during LP discharges has been systematically compared, and the reliability of the measurement systems has been validated."

We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel’s TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4–8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs)."

    "abstract": "Statistical computations are becoming increasingly important. These computations often need to be performed in log-space because probabilities become extremely small due to repeated multiplications. While using logarithms effectively prevents numerical underflow, this paper shows that its cost is high in performance, resource utilization, and, notably, numerical accuracy. This paper then argues that using posit, a recently proposed floating-point format, is a better strategy for statistical computations operating on extremely small numbers because of its unique encoding mechanism. To that end, this paper performs a comprehensive analysis comparing posit, binary64, and logarithm representations, examining both individual arithmetic operations, statistical bioinformatics applications, and their accelerators. FPGA implementation results highlight that posit-based accelerators can achieve up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy, up to 60% lower resource utilization, and up to 1.3× speedup, compared to log-space accelerators. Such improvement translates to 2× performance per unit resource on the FPGA."

    "abstract": "Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation (EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices, which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit. Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

    "abstract": "Modern processors are becoming increasingly complicated, making them hard to be bug-free. Bounded model checking (BMC) and coverage-guided fuzzing (CGF) are two main complementary techniques for verifying processors. BMC can exhaustively explore the state-space upto a given path-depth bound, but suffers from the infamous state-space explosion problem, thus limited to smaller bounds for realistic processor designs. CGF is efficient and scalable for verifying large-scale complex designs, but struggles with the coverage due to the difficulty in generating comprehensive and diverse seeds. To bring the best of both worlds, we propose BMCFuzz, a novel two-way hybrid verification approach that synergistically integrates BMC and CGF. Specifically, BMCFuzz alternatively switches BMC and CGF according to their performance in improving coverage, where CGF is leveraged to quickly explore the state space, detect flaws, and moreover record snapshots that are crucial valuations of all the circuit-level registers, while BMC with selected high-valuable snapshots as initial states is utilized to exhaustively explore uncovered points. Moreover, the witnesses of BMC are further used to generate seeds for CGF. This synergistic integration of BMC and CGF helps BMC alleviate the state-space explosion problem and feeds CGF with more high-quality seeds. We implement BMCFuzz as a fully open-source tool and evaluate it on three well-known open-source RISC-V processor designs (i.e., NutShell, Rocket, and BOOM). Experimental results show that BMCFuzz achieves higher coverage compared to the state-of-the-art methods and discovers three previously unknown bugs, demonstrating the potential of BMCFuzz as a powerful, open-source tool for advancing processor design and verification."

With the Translational Organ-on-Chip Platform, we can combine multiple Organ-on-Chip (OoC) systems with other building blocks to facilitate seamless integration of inline sensing and complex multi-organ experiments. A significant challenge in this research is generating the correct microfluidic routing architecture. The geometry of routing channels must be chosen carefully, as it directly affects fluid flow distribution and circulation within and between the microfluidic building blocks. Currently, this routing is typically performed manually by drawing the channel geometry in computer-aided design software. In the field of design automation, several software packages already exist that enable the automatic design of electrical connections/signals. Therefore, we present a comprehensive method for multilayer fluidic channel routing in this paper, utilizing the printed circuit board designer from Fusion electronics, a commonly used software package in the microfluidics field. We demonstrate this method by routing a complex multi-OoC system designed to study mechanobiology, which contains multiple independent fluidic loops and pneumatic circuitry. We continue to discuss the advantages and limitations of the method presented in this paper to finally arrive at a list of desired functionalities for to-be-developed microfluidics-tailored routing tools. We envision the method and observations presented here as inspiration for the development of future microfluidics-specific tools."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved the capabilities of programming. While these models excel at generating valid software, applying them to the hardware domain remains challenging due to the intrinsic complexity and strict structural semantics required in hardware design. Current LLM approaches for hardware generation typically focus on direct generation. This often results in hardware implementations with functional errors or structural flaws. To overcome these limitations, we propose a reasoning-enhanced training framework explicitly tailored for hardware generation tasks. Our multi-stage methodology combines systematic dataset curation via compilation filtering (achieving a 100% pass rate compared to 27 − 44% in existing datasets), Function-Aligned Differentiated Revision for comparative annotation across five RTL-relevant dimensions, supervised fine-tuning using reasoning prompts, and reinforcement learning guided by Verilator Parser. Our experiments show that explicitly incorporating reasoning substantially enhances the structural integrity and functional correctness of generated hardware designs, improving pass@1 rates by up to 20% on VerilogEval Human benchmarks and reproducing the \"Aha moment\", where the model explicitly organizes ideas before generation. Our work demonstrates that smaller, specialized reasoning models (1.5B parameters) can effectively augment larger open-source language models through reasoning transfer."

This work builds upon prior research by utilizing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the interaction between silk and a CNT in an acidic environment similar to that of a silkworm’s stomach. The objective of this work is to use docking techniques to predict the active residues on silk that interact with CNTs, and to subsequently test these predictions through MD simulations involving a single CNT. By confirming the expected active binding sites, this study aims to explore fundamental processes such as $\\pi$-based interactions and hydrophobic forces that facilitate the preferential accumulation of CNTs at these specific locations.

We propose an attention-based microarchitecture search framework for effective cross-architecture knowledge transfer. Our approach propose a cross-attention network to capture interdependencies between microarchitectural topology and design tool configurations, enabling knowledge adaptation across architectures with minimal fine-tuning. Additionally, we complement it with an uncertainty-guided optimization strategy that efficiently navigates search based on specific user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate our approach outperforms previous methods with 68.16% higher hypervolume indicators and 3.85× speed-up of time in reaching the same hypervolume. Furthermore, our approach successfully discovers design points that meet user-specified PPA targets that state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods failed to identify.

To remedy this inefficiency, we propose a novel NIMCH node remapping flow consisting of the following two schemes: a parallel longest-path-first scheme and an iterative minimum-slack-first scheme. Both schemes prioritize timing-critical nodes to reduce runtime. Moreover, the first scheme enables parallel execution, substantially accelerating the remapping process. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an average runtime speedup of 5.58X compared to the state-of-the-art approach, while preserving placement quality. The improved efficiency and scalability of our flow make it well-suited for large-scale physical design applications where rapid timing closure is essential."

This work introduces exploitable backdoors in ISC that encode the output of the analog computation unit to create covert channels. Through theoretical modeling and empirical case studies, we investigate two ISC-specific covert channels: a logic covert channel and a frequency covert channel. These channels are established by deliberately manipulating the analog computation unit co-integrated with sensing materials on a shared substrate, thereby enabling adversaries to exfiltrate sensitive information, posing substantial threats to the security and privacy of real-world ISC applications."

    "abstract": "Radiation-Induced single event upsets (SEUs) significantly damage the reliability of Deep Convolution Neural Networks (DCNNs) in harsh environments, i.e., deep space. Stochastic computing (SC) has exhibited the outstanding tolerance against SEUs via diluting a binary weight in a longer stochastic stream. However, the exponential expanding of stochastic streams and multi-layer neural networks together incur an unaffordable hardware consumption in their fully hardened SC-DCNN circuits. In this paper, SCArmor, a genetic evolution-based hardening framework, is proposed to select the critical bits and layers fast for the reliable and lightweight anti-radiation designs. First, a layer-wise error propagation model (LEPM) is built to evaluate the layer-sensitivity that indicates how many of a faulty-layer errors propagated to the downstream, serving as the reliability weights across the layers in SC-DCNNs. Second, the bit-sensitivity is modeled with sensitivity-driven fault injection (SDFI) to highlight those critical bits in both stochastic and unary numbers, which are further accumulated within a layer, i.e., convolution, activation, pooling, and full connection, to estimate the fault-tolerant abilities of the individual layers. Finally, by jointly using above two sensitivities as the fast emulation of inference accuracy, a re-training-free genetic algorithm is embedded into the hardening framework to locate the primary layers and SC-bits that should be hardened under the constraints of both inference accuracy and circuit cost. On the popular SC-DCNNs, the results show that, compared with the SOTA hardening methods, SCArmor reduces the area, power, and latency by 22.21%, 29.69%, and 43.15% respectively, only using 42.46% cost of full-hardening approaches. Regarding reliability, the accuracy of SCArmor achieves up to 98.63% of that of the radiation-free inference, outperforming the SOTAs by 3.13%."

However, FALCON is regarded as highly computationally complex, and as a result, few works for hardware acceleration of FALCON can be found in the literature, where the few existing ones only target high-performance. To fill the gap, this paper presents a Lightweight and Efficient hardware accelerator for the Signature Verification portion of FALCON (LEAF), specifically for resource-constrained applications. We propose an efficient design strategy, including a novel data dependence flow, to maximize the utilization of very small resources for all arithmetic procedures. Then, the proposed full-hardware LEAF is built, containing an ultra-lightweight number theoretical transform (NTT) core with a novel twiddle factor access pattern. Finally, we conduct a thorough evaluation to demonstrate the efficiency of LEAF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lightweight and meanwhile most resource-efficient FALCON Signature Verification full-hardware accelerator in the literature, offering 65% and 66% less aggregate resource usage and achieving 24% and 14% less equivalent area-time product (eATP), compared to the state-of-the-art for FALCON-512 and FALCON-1024, respectively.

To remove outliers in the sequence of RR intervals before the occurrence of sudden cardiac death, a median filter was used only on fragments that include outliers. The following parameters of heart rate variability were calculated: standard deviation of RR intervals, Shannon entropy, approximated entropy, and multiscale variation. Using the Fischer linear discriminant method, two conditions were classified (normal and before sudden cardiac death) and the accuracy of such classification was calculated."

    "abstract": "The emerging analog Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures have shown great potential to overcome the memory wall problem and accelerate neural network (NN) inference. However, different from digital architectures, the computation accuracy of analog PIM architectures is directly impacted by various errors, which are related to both software and hardware parameters. Existing PIM simulators mainly adopt the bit-and-crossbar slicing paradigm to evaluate the accuracy under various errors. Each MVM operation is performed bit by bit and crossbar by crossbar, which is extremely time-consuming, especially for models with a larger number of parameters, such as large language models (LLMs).In this work, we propose an error-injected robustness metric, unifying various errors into the weight dimension and facilitating joint error analysis. Based on the error-injected robustness metric, we propose a Non-Ideal PIM Accuracy (NIPA) evaluation model for relative accuracy evaluation, considering the coupling effect (i.e., various errors can be affected by the same factor) among various errors using NN’s prior information. We further propose a non-slicing absolute accuracy evaluation method, eliminating the need for the time-consuming bit-and-crossbar slicing process. Extensive experiments on CNNs and LLMs validate that the proposed NIPA evaluation model achieves high correlations of up to 0.91 with the absolute accuracy evaluated by DNN+NeuroSim. At the same time, compared to existing bit-and-crossbar slicing evaluation methods, the proposed non-slicing absolute accuracy evaluation method achieves up to 105.8× speedup with average evaluation errors as low as 0.29%."

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming (DP) plays a crucial role as the backbone of many core optimization algorithms across the physical design flow, including placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing. However, DP methods with quadratic or higher time complexities often face scalability challenges in large-scale designs. In this work, we propose a novel GPU-accelerated DP technique that can be broadly adaptable to various DP-based algorithms. As a case study, we present a GPU-accelerated detailed placement framework targeting mixed-cell-height designs, built upon an optimal DP formulation. By leveraging the massive parallelism of modern GPUs and incorporating advanced cost accumulation strategies, our approach consistently delivers optimal placement solutions while achieving an average runtime reduction of 96.6% and peak speedups exceeding 1600×. This work demonstrates the potential of GPU acceleration not only to overcome runtime bottlenecks but also to enhance design quality in advanced physical design tasks."

    "abstract": "AdderNet emerges with superior hardware efficiencies compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by replacing the multiplicative operations with energy-efficient additive alternatives. Nevertheless, AdderNet’s security exploration remains underexplored, especially against emerging adversarial weight perturbation attacks, such as the Bit-Flip Attack (BFA), which injects memory faults into weight bits. In this paper, we investigate AdderNet’s vulnerabilities to BFA for the first time and discover that it is more susceptible to BFA than its CNN counterpart. To utilize the hardware efficiency of AdderNet and at the same time improve resiliency against BFA, we propose a novel Non-Negative AdderNet ${\\text{ (}}\\overleftarrow {{\\text{NNAN}}} {\\text{)}}$ model. Proposed ${\\text{ (}}\\overleftarrow {{\\text{NNAN}}} {\\text{)}}$ consists of two key components: i) it incorporates a non-positive weight encoding technique, and ii) a novel accelerator design with an integrated non-positive decoder (NPD) to achieve hardware-level lightweight and runtime detection and correction of BFA. To further test the resilience of our proposed defense, we perform both a baseline BFA and an advanced BFA (BFA+), where the attacker has sufficient knowledge about the proposed defense. Our proposed $\\overleftarrow {{\\text{NNAN}}} $ makes BFA obsolete and requires many more attack cycles to be compromised against BFA+, successfully enabling the design of both hardware-efficient and secure AdderNet against BFA."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach to the problem of synthesizing standard cells is presented. The top priority objective in the conventional approaches has been invariably placed on minimizing cell area. However, in our approach, we place the top priority on minimizing cell delay as opposed to minimizing cell area, which has never been addressed as yet, but is very valuable and highly important for implementing high-performance chips at advanced technology nodes. Precisely, we propose a totally different approach, developing a cell delay driven layout synthesis method, which is composed of three steps: (1) a critical path driven transistor placement, which is formulated into a search tree based exhaustive placement enumeration, employing an effective pruning technique, followed by (2) an optimal transistor folding, formulating it into an instance of DP (dynamic programming) to reduce cell area by maximizing the occurrences of diffusion sharing and minimizing the oxide diffusion jog rule violations, then (3) an optimal critical net driven in-cell routing, formulating it into an instance of SMT (satisfiability modulo theory) problem. In the meantime, through experiments with benchmarks, it is shown that our cell synthesis approach is able to produce cells with up to 9.3% shorter delay. More importantly, by using those cells, we are able to increase the circuit clock frequency by 7.2% on average while retaining nearly the same chip area and power consumption over that produced by using the conventional cells."

    "abstract": "Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is a popular design style of logic-in-memory (LiM) architectures, which enables memory arrays to perform logic operations to achieve low energy consumption and high throughput. To implement a target function on the data stored in memory, the function is first transformed into a netlist of the supported logic operations by logic synthesis. Then, a scheduler transforms the netlist into an instruction sequence given to the architecture, where an instruction either performs a logic operation in the netlist on memory rows within a single array or copies the data from one array to another. Most existing schedulers focus on optimizing the execution sequence of the operations to minimize the number of memory rows needed, neglecting the energy-consuming copy instructions that cannot be avoided when working with arrays with limited sizes. In this work, we focus on reducing the number of copy instructions to decrease the total energy consumption. We propose MASIM, a multi-array scheduler for SIMD logic-in-memory architectures. It consists of a priority-based scheduling algorithm and an iterative improvement process. Compared to the best existing scheduler, MASIM reduces the number of copy instructions by 63.2% on average, which leads to a 28.0% reduction in energy. The experiment also shows that MASIM can be applied to various SIMD LiM architectures, showing its wide applicability."

    "abstract": "As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity, the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles, innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis, placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However, LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives."

To approximate the ammonium (SNHe) concentration in the effluent, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (NN) was trained, using selected reference simulations from Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 (BSM2) as input variables. To identify the most relevant predictors, recursive feature elimination (RFE) was performed. The surrogate model was first trained on open-loop simulation data and then integrated into a closed-loop control system by generating oxygen transfer rate (KLa) inputs based on SNHe predictions. This data-driven KLa signal was injected into the BSM2 simulation in place of the standard controller. A feedback-based retraining process was used to refine the model’s performance under controlled conditions. Experimental results demonstrate high prediction accuracy, a coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) with an average value of 0.974, and a substantial reduction in effluent SNH levels, with SNHe values decreasing from an average of 7.62 mg/L to 0.19 mg/L after control. These findings support the integration of AI-based surrogate models into supervisory control strategies for wastewater treatment plants."

Despite the availability of environmental monitoring devices, many existing solutions rely on static thresholds applied directly to raw sensor data (e.g., temperature and relative humidity), rather than integrating scientifically validated models for mold risk prediction. This paper introduces MoldSafe, an IoT-based system for real-time mold risk assessment, which transforms the theoretical Viitanen mold growth model (VTT) into a practical application. MoldSafe collects temperature and humidity data using ESP8266 nodes equipped with BME280 sensors, transmits this information via MQTT to a modular back-end infrastructure, and provides a user-friendly interface implemented as a PWA, enabling accessibility across all devices. This data is processed to estimate the risk of mold growth, providing users with early notifications to prevent it. The proposed solution is scalable and efficient due to the use of a modern architecture and serves as a practical foundation for validating the VTT model by facilitating continuous data collection in real-world conditions through the deployment of physical sensors. The system evaluation demonstrated reliable and consistent communication, resource-efficient and scalable back-end processing, and high performance data handling for 50 active sensors."

To address this, we propose FlexOn, a novel framework that combines fine-grained model segmentation and dynamic resource selection to rapidly adapt to highly dynamic runtime conditions and effectively mitigate unpredictable resource contention. A prototype built on LiteRT demonstrates significant improvements in both average and tail latencies of up to 54% and 58%, respectively, across three different embedded platforms under dynamically varying resource availability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the resource contention in open embedded systems for better machine learning inference responsiveness."

This paper introduces CLiSent, a framework that addresses these challenges through two core contributions: a sentiment-preserving translation and classification protocol and a novel multi-heuristic outlier detection module. The translation protocol integrates multilingual transformer models, including XLM-R, with evaluation measures that jointly assess translation fidelity using BLEU and METEOR, as well as sentiment preservation metrics that quantify polarity consistency. The outlier detection module introduces a new combination of prediction confidence thresholds, translate-verify checks, and embedding distance analysis, enabling systematic identification of atypical or minority opinions—an aspect that has not been explicitly addressed in prior CLSA work. Experiments were conducted on datasets in Arabic, Chinese, French, and Italian using standard train/dev/test splits. Results demonstrate that CLiSent achieves an average macro F1-score of 0.89 (with per-language scores not exceeding 0.92), while the outlier detection module obtains a precision of 0.78 and a recall of 0.72 on manually annotated benchmarks. These findings confirm that CLiSent not only delivers competitive sentiment classification performance across multiple languages but also improves robustness by preserving sentiment meaning during translation and identifying sentiment outliers."

Existing studies mainly focus on post-disaster resource scheduling, neglecting pre-disaster defensive planning, and they often oversimplify extreme weather modeling and lack a comprehensive coordination mechanism for emergency resources. To enhance grid security, this paper proposes a pre-disaster and post-disaster resilience improvement strategy for distribution networks under extreme weather conditions, considering multi-resource coordination. First, a modeling analysis is conducted to examine the impact of extreme weather typhoon disasters on the distribution network, simulating the typhoon landfall, movement path, and wind field models. The CH-Kmeans method is used to extract typical typhoon scenarios and construct distribution line fault scenarios in the region. Second, from the perspective of multi-resource coordination, a pre-deployment model is developed, considering the uncertainty of photovoltaic output, and solved using the C&CG method. Third, based on pre-disaster configuration and road network conditions, SOP and various emergency resource coordination recovery strategies are formulated. Finally, simulations are performed on the modified IEEE 33-node distribution system to analyze the impact of typhoon characteristics on the fault conditions of the distribution network and validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improvement strategy."

    "abstract": "Partial shading is a critical challenge in photovoltaic (PV) systems, significantly reducing power generation due to uneven irradiance across the array. This causes mismatch losses, hotspot formation, and multiple peaks in power-voltage characteristics. This paper presents a novel sensor-free solar panel reconfiguration scheme for consumers based on a Gray code decimal sequence to mitigate these effects. The proposed approach uses a set of generalized mathematical expressions to physically rearrange PV panels at the time of installation, while maintaining electrical connections equivalent to the traditional totally-cross-tied (TCT) configuration. This relocation effectively disperses shading concentration, reduces mismatch losses, and enhances energy extraction. The scheme draws conceptual inspiration from transposition techniques in power systems, aiming to balance the electrical characteristics of the PV array. Performance is evaluated under both static and 400 randomly generated partial shading scenarios. Simulation results show a notable improvement in output power ranging from 5.79% to 23.64% compared to the TCT arrangement. Experimental validation is performed on 60 W and 1200 W PV prototypes, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method. The scheme provides a low-cost, implementation-friendly solution for maximizing energy efficiency in partially shaded PV systems, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in modern power systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, autoencoder-based models have demonstrated significant potential in hyperspectral anomaly detection. However, the inherent class imbalance between anomaly and background samples, coupled with substantial intra-class heterogeneity within background components, often leads traditional models to excessively capture majority-class background features, thereby weakening their discriminative capabilities for minority-class backgrounds and anomaly targets. Concurrently, conventional methods fail to sufficiently model nonlinear features and adapt to complex environments, undermining their detection performance and robustness in intricate environmental interference. To address these challenges, we propose MiKA-HAD, a Minority-augmented KAN-based Hybrid self-supervised framework for hyperspectral Anomaly Detection. It incorporates a density-based clustering-guided sample balancing strategy that dynamically synthesizes minority background samples with spectral-spatial diversity through self-supervised learning. This approach achieves feature space rebalancing while effectively suppressing noise interference on anomaly boundaries. To overcome high-dimensional data complexity and nonlinear feature extraction challenges, we construct a Hybrid Self-Supervised network with a KAN-based multi-path collaborative module that orchestrates synergy between local sensitivity preservation, nonlinear feature modeling, and global consistency maintenance. This tripartite architecture establishes dynamic equilibrium that enhances representation capability and environmental robustness. Extensive experiments show MiKA-HAD achieves superior detection accuracy and stability compared to existing approaches, particularly in complex environments with varying noise conditions. The framework establishes a new paradigm for robust hyperspectral anomaly detection by addressing both class imbalance bias and nonlinear feature modeling limitations."

    "abstract": "Pulsed eddy current testing (PECT) is a widely used nondestructive evaluation technique due to its broadband frequency content and ability to extract rich information from both time- and frequency-domains. However, its effectiveness in detecting deeply buried defects is limited by the weak magnetic perturbations generated by subsurface anomalies. To address this challenge, we propose a novel magnetic-field differential PECT probe combined with an advanced bispectral signal processing algorithm to enhance defect detectability and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed probe generates a localized region with a near-zero background magnetic field and suppresses interference from the primary excitation. A ferrite core is incorporated to concentrate eddy currents, while a high-sensitivity Hall sensor is positioned within the zero-field region to selectively detect defect-induced perturbation fields. To further improve robustness against noise, bispectral analysis—a higher-order spectral technique immune to Gaussian noise—is applied to enhance signal quality and support more effective defect characterization. Finite element simulations were conducted to analyze the magnetic field and eddy current distributions of the PECT probe. The probe employs a magnetic field differential design to suppress background interference and enhance sensitivity to subsurface defects. Experimental results on aluminum specimens demonstrated successful detection of subsurface defects up to 8 mm beneath the surface. Bispectral analysis significantly improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and defect characterization, highlighting its potential for enhanced subsurface defect detection in PECT."

    "abstract": "Trains are complex systems operating at high frequency, with bogies serving as critical load-bearing and guiding components. Accurate fault diagnosis of bogies is vital for safe and reliable railway operation. Compared to single faults, system-level compound faults are harder to diagnose due to complex mechanisms, limited data, and diverse combinations. To address this, we propose MMFFD-Net (Multi-model Multi-label Fusion Fault Diagnosis Network), which elevates data fusion from feature-level to task-level. It employs structural decoupling and task-aware fusion to build a small-sample-friendly learning mechanism, with sub-models tailored to signal modalities (current/vibration) and fault modes (single/compound). A ResNet1D backbone extracts robust temporal features, while domain-adversarial training improves generalization under unseen conditions. A novel three-branch decision-level fusion strategy enables precise multi-label prediction of single, component-level, and system-level compound faults. Experiments on a scaled train bogie dataset show that MMFFD-Net achieves 95.47% system-level accuracy, with F1-scores exceeding 90% across major subsystems, including motors, gearboxes, and axle boxes. Compared with traditional classifiers and simpler fusion strategies, MMFFD-Net demonstrates superior robustness and fine-grained diagnostic capability.

    "abstract": "This article presents an impact-aware manipulation framework and its application to logistics, where the challenges related to the booming of e-commerce have increased the need for faster and more flexible package handling solutions. Particularly, the proposed impact-aware framework addresses the problem of swiftly grabbing and placing objects in depalletizing tasks with dual-arm robotic systems. Impact-aware robotics leverages intentional collisions to achieve dynamic interactions and thus has the potential to be faster and more energy efficient than the state of the art based on quasi-static interactions with objects or environments. The generation of desired impacts (contacts at a nonzero relative speed), generally avoided in classical robotics, brings multiple challenges encompassing the generation of robust motions, managing the impact with the object, dealing with the physical constraints of the robotic systems, contact state sensing, and simulation of contact behavior. To tackle these challenges, we developed, within the European Union (EU)-funded project Impact-Aware Manipulation (I.AM.), impact-aware technologies that yield an integrated impact-aware solution. The proposed framework exploits nonsmooth mechanics to provide robot‒object‒environment impact models; it uses dynamical systems (DSs) to generate nominal and contingency motions with intentional impacts; it leverages quadratic programming (QP)-based control to provide motion execution with the ability to enforce hardware and safety constraints; it employs internal state sensing that does not require an external force transducer; and, finally, it develops an impact simulation environment that can handle batch simulations. This article highlights the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of speed (a 29% decrease in average task time) and energy efficiency (a 35% decrease) through a systematic comparison between classical grabbing and impact-aware swift grabbing and tossing. In summary, our article underscores the transformative potential of impact-aware technologies in revolutionizing robotic logistics operations.

    "abstract": "Robust near duplicate video matching remains difficult under combined geometric, photometric, and temporal edits, while provenance requires verifiable links between content and identity. We propose OrthoHueHashChain, a distortion aware hybrid framework that couples a new multi cue similarity method with on-chain registration. At its core is HybridFusion, which fuses Zernike moments (geometric robustness), Color Moments (hue/illumination changes), and perceptual hashing (pHash). The fusion is made reliable through (i) ORB based warp gating to suppress cues that become unreliable under geometric transforms, (ii) dual outlier rejection to damp spurious peaks, (iii) hue gated correction for strong colour shifts, (iv) a consensus fallback rule, and (v) temporal median smoothing. A lightweight 8 frame distortion probe predicts the dominant edit (colour/blur/warp) and selects the primary metric, reducing compute relative to always on fusion. To ensure provenance, we derive a compact fusion fingerprint from the per frame fused scores, anchor its Merkle root and the video’s IPFS CID on-chain, and mint an ERC-721 token. A registry smart contract maintains a mapping from fingerprint hash to token ID and enforces DID based approvals to prevent duplicate or spam mints. On a dataset comprising one source video and 15 edit types across 19 edited clips (types: zoom, crop, affine, perspective, vertical flip, colour filter, blur, sharpen, smoothing, compression, resize, edges, frame rate conversion, looping, and frame dropping; additional variants: 90° rotation, horizontal flip, pure translation, and slowdown rate change), HybridFusion attains the highest average similarity (0.9417) and is the best performing method on 18 out of 19 edited videos, outperforming classical single cue baselines (Zernike, ColorMoment, a/d/wHash, pHash). We analyse remaining failure modes (notably strong perspective transforms) and discuss homography aware gating and simple temporal alignment as remedies. The results indicate that OrthoHueHashChain offers a practical path to accurate video matching with verifiable, blockchain backed ownership records."

Blockchain offers a trusted solution with its inherent decentralization and tamper-proof characteristics. However, heterogeneous blockchains used by different IoT networks lead to difficulties in inter-chain data exchange and further form a \"data silo\". To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a cross-chain collaborative data transfer channel based on asynchronous confirmation transaction stacks (CCTS) specifically designed for IoT environments’ data trading. By leveraging a relay chain architecture, our solution enables secure cross-chain transaction negotiation and coordinates efficient off-chain data transmission between IoT devices and systems, achieving anti-repudiation and traceability for critical IoT data exchanges. Experimental results demonstrate that the method supports millisecond-to-second latency for cross-chain transactions and maintains low on-chain storage overhead suitable for resource-constrained IoT nodes. Overall, CCTS provides a scalable framework for building robust, interoperable data trading networks with verifiable data provenance."

In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based phase space graph convolutional network (PSGformer) to enhance performance with a lightweight and high-precision design. PSGformer introduces phase space recurrence networks to map time series to graphs, enabling the extraction of rich signal features using graph data mining techniques. To improve the efficiency of graph mapping, an improved Transformer’s linear attention mechanism is used to parallelize graph construction and convolution, reducing dependency on adjacency matrix thresholds. Additionally, PSGformer integrates a deep shrinkage convolutional network as a side channel to address the sensitivity to Gaussian white noise and linear attention mechanism limitations. Data preprocessing is handled by a frequency selection module. Experiments on multiple datasets (RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, Sig2019-12, and RML2018.01a) demonstrate that PSGformer outperforms most existing re-representation models."

To address this issue, we propose TripleMixer, a robust and efficient point cloud denoising network that integrates spatial, frequency, and channel-wise processing through three specialized mixer modules. TripleMixer effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while preserving essential geometric structures and can be seamlessly deployed as a plug-and-play module within existing LiDAR perception pipelines. To support the development and evaluation of denoising methods, we construct two large-scale simulated datasets, Weather-KITTI and Weather-NuScenes, covering diverse weather scenarios with dense point-wise semantic and noise annotations. Based on these datasets, we establish four benchmarks: Denoising, Semantic Segmentation (SS), Place Recognition (PR), and Object Detection (OD). These benchmarks enable systematic evaluation of denoising generalization, transferability, and downstream impact under both simulated and real-world adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TripleMixer achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance and yields substantial improvements across all downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Our results highlight the potential of denoising as a task-agnostic preprocessing strategy to enhance LiDAR robustness in real-world autonomous driving applications."

Existing methods often rely on multi-modal information (such as OCR result) or complex model architectures, leading to reduced processing efficiency and difficulty in meeting the needs of real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on the YOLOv11 framework that combines synthetic data augmentation and heuristic topological sorting optimization to achieve layout analysis driven by visual inputs. First, we model the document page synthesis as the rectangle layout problem to generate a large amount of labeled document images with complex layout structures, which helps mitigate the lack of training data. Secondly, an improved YOLOv11 model is adopted for document element detection. By introducing the self-modulation feature aggregation module, the fine-grained feature extraction capability is enhanced. Finally, we design a post-processing algorithm based on heuristic topological sorting to convert detection results into a serialized structure and correct logical errors. Experimental results show that this method achieves 93.9% mAP on real financial document datasets, with an improvement of 2.1% over baselines, providing an efficient and convenient solution for document layout analysis without OCR dependency."

Building on prior shared-space approaches, our method first aligns overlapping rooms to maximize a shared space—a common area containing matched real and virtual objects where all users can interact. Uniquely, our system extends beyond this shared space by visualizing non-shared spaces, the remaining part of each room, allowing users to inhabit these distinct areas. To address the issue of overlap between non-shared spaces, we dynamically adjust their visibility based on user proximity, using a Voronoi diagram to prioritize subspaces closer to each user. Visualizing the surrounding space of each user conveys spatial context, helping others interpret their behavior within their environment. Visibility is updated in real time as users move, maintaining a coherent sense of spatial awareness. Through a user study, we demonstrate that our system enhances enjoyment, spatial understanding, and presence compared to shared-space-only approaches. Quantitative results further show that our dynamic visibility modulation improves both personal space preservation and space accessibility relative to static methods. Overall, our system provides users with a seamless, dynamically connected, and shared multi-room environment."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in hybrid automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have demonstrated promising clinical potential for blood glucose regulation of patients with type 1 diabetes. However, the performance of the closed-loop glucose control algorithms in AID systems is still challenged by the substantial inter-subject variability. In this work, we propose a personalized controller based on an offset-free data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method. Specifically, different Hankel matrices based on the subject-specific insulin-glucose trajectories for typical glycemic behavioral scenarios are constructed and scheduled based on the current glucose fluctuations to depict the highly nonlinear behaviors of the glucose dynamic system. An incremental form of insulin inputs is adopted in the formulation of DeePC to mitigate the tracking offsets caused by the mismatch in the basal rate profile or the behavioral system representation. Besides, based on the estimated individualized insulin sensitivity, an adaptive penalty mechanism is designed, which utilizes an insulin-sensitivity-dependent input penalty term in the optimization problem to adjust the aggressiveness of the control algorithm in real-time to adapt to the variation of the insulin requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by the designed comprehensive <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in silico</i> experiments from the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova T1DM simulator. For the scenario of under-estimated basal rate, the proposed algorithm obtains statistically significant improvement in terms of the percent time in euglycemia 70-180 mg/dL (73.4% vs. 64.8%) and the mean glucose (150.4 mg/dL vs. 166.4 mg/dL) in comparison with the model-based controller. Advisory-mode analysis using clinical data indicates that the proposed controller can mitigate persistent hyperglycemia by recommending additional insulin delivery dosages compared to those administered by the clinician."

However, in long tunnel environments, satellite signals are obstructed by tunnel structures, resulting in measurement interruptions. Consequently, Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) lack external calibration reference points, and train positioning error increases exponentially over time. To achieve long-distance, continuous, and accurate measurement of train position information in tunnel environments, this paper proposes a positioning method based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging model correction. First, a positioning testing platform was established in a tunnel environment to collect and analyze the propagation characteristics of UWB signals in both straight and curved tunnel sections. To address the sensitivity of initial parameter selection in the UWB ranging model calibration process, a Multi-Strategy Enhanced Generalized Normal Distribution Optimization (MEGNDO) algorithm was proposed. And incorporating the propagation characteristics of UWB signals in tunnel environments, we designed segmented weighted objective functions to mitigate \"far-field\" positioning errors. Based on actual measurement data, the UWB ranging model calibrated by MEGNDO achieved lower positioning errors in both straight and curved tunnel environments, outperforming other methods."

However, existing methods have not fully considered the complex physical interferences in the real world, nor the multi-scale and temporal observation characteristics of UAV-based detection, which makes the generated camouflage difficult to maintain effectiveness in practical tasks. To address this limitations, a fully-covered robust adversarial camouflage generation framework for UAV-based detection models is introduced. First, the Physically Based Differentiable Renderer (PBDR) is designed to simulate global illumination, surface reflectance, and atmospheric scattering, thereby incorporating complex physical interference factors during camouflage training. Second, the Pyramid Camouflage Training Framework (PCTF) is introduced, which conducts hierarchical training on distance-varying inputs to preserve the multi-scale adaptability of camouflage features across layers and ensure inter-frame consistency within layers. Furthermore, the limitations of existing evaluation indicators for UAV-based adversarial attacks are analyzed, and a novel set of indicators is proposed for evaluating physical adversarial camouflage in remote sensing. Extensive cross-domain experiments in both digital space and physical world demonstrate superior performance compared with SOTA methods.

To address this gap, we adapted attention-guided class activation maps (AG-CAM) for VLMs, to visualize the influence and importance of input features (image and text) on model responses. Using this approach, we conducted an examination of four open-source (ChartGemma, Janus 1B and 7B, and LLaVA) and two closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) models comparing their performance and, for the open-source models, their AG-CAM results. Overall, we found that ChartGemma, a 3B parameter VLM fine-tuned for chart question-answering (QA), outperformed other open-source models and exhibited performance on par with significantly larger closed-source VLMs. We also found that VLMs exhibit spatial reasoning by accurately localizing key chart features, and semantic reasoning by associating visual elements with corresponding data values and query tokens. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the use of AG-CAM on early fusion VLM architectures, which are widely used, and for chart QA. We also show preliminary evidence that these results can align with human reasoning. Our promising open-source VLMs results pave the way for transparent and reproducible research in AI visualization literacy. Code and Supplemental Materials: https://osf.io/fp3rg"

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) effectively preserves data privacy but faces challenges such as the significant communication overhead from frequent model updates between user equipment (UE) and mobile edge computing servers (MECS), performance degradation under non-IID data distributions, and UE dropouts due to resource constraints. Since MECSs cannot mandate participation, effective incentives are crucial to secure sufficient training data. This paper proposes an incentive-driven secure Clustered FL (CFL) framework supporting operations across base stations (BSs). The framework incorporates dual privacy protection through end-to-end encryption for secure cross-BS model exchange and differential privacy during aggregation. To accurately evaluate contributions, we design a dual-component metric combining model distance with local accuracy. Furthermore, we formulate the incentive problem as a two-layer Stackelberg game that integrates virtual rewards with tangible bandwidth allocation, incorporating amplified rewards for cross-BS participation. In this game, MECSs act as leaders aiming to maximize their long-term utility, defined as the weighted improvement in global model accuracy minus incentive costs, while ensuring sustained UE engagement. UEs, as followers, maximize their net utility, calculated as incentives derived from local accuracy, model similarity, and cross-BS reward minus their computational and energy costs, under individual resource constraints. The optimal UE strategy is derived using the bisection method, and a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed for MECS decision-making under incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively screens out low-contributing UEs that hinder convergence while incentivizing high-performing participants, leading to efficient and reliable model training."

    "abstract": "The Ground-Airborne Frequency Domain Electromagnetic Method (GAFDEM) utilizes multi-frequency signals to detect underground electrical structures. However, its non-stationary characteristics and spectral aliasing issues make it challenging to accurately capture the amplitude and phase of time-varying electromagnetic responses. To address the problems of insufficient frequency resolution and poor resistance to adjacent frequency interference in traditional methods, this paper proposes a Frequency-domain Masking and Hilbert-transform based Joint Amplitude-Phase Extraction Method (FM-HAPE). First, a binary frequency-domain masking mechanism with adaptive relative bandwidth adjustment is introduced in FM-HAPE, which dynamically controls the mask width at different frequency points, thereby enabling precise isolation of the target frequency band energy and robust suppression of frequency drift. Second, a symmetric zero-phase FIR filtering technique based on the Hilbert Transform is presented, which effectively eliminates group delay errors. Lastly, an adaptive unwrapping method based on the local phase change slope is proposed to enhance the preservation of phase continuity in noisy environments. In addition, accurate decoupling of instantaneous amplitude and phase is achieved by FM-HAPE without the need for window function constraints. Simulation results show that under adjacent-frequency interference of ±1–5 Hz and a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 dB, FM-HAPE achieves an average amplitude RMSE of 0.026 μV and an average phase RMSE of about 0.1°, demonstrating strong anti-interference capability. Field data further indicate that FM-HAPE effectively reduces amplitude and phase variability compared with traditional methods, while producing smoother and more continuous pseudo-depth imaging results. This method provides a new solution for high-precision parameter extraction of non-stationary multi-frequency signals in deep electromagnetic exploration."

    "abstract": "Training and inference of large-scale machine learning models place diverse demands on compute systems, with increasingly higher requirements for processing power, memory capacity, and memory bandwidth. Current compute systems mainly comprise CUs tightly coupled to a fixed amount of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which needs to be placed in close proximity to the compute die due to constraints related to signal integrity, energy consumption and limited die periphery. This tight coupling limits the system's ability to flexibly adapt to varying compute and memory demands. In this work, we start by exploring the design space of co-packaged photonic I/Os and identifying compute die's shoreline width as a critical architectural constraint. We then present SiPAM, a silicon photonic accelerated memory pooling architecture that integrates dense wavelength division multiplexed (DWDM) photonic I/Os directly along the compute die's shoreline. By replacing local HBMs and conventional electrical networking interfaces with photonic I/Os, we build an unified high-bandwidth photonic communication domain that enables reconfigurable access to both memory and network resources. This architectural design decouples memory and network scaling from compute packaging constraints and allows the system to flexibly adapt to workload demands. We then develop a quantitative optimization methodology to efficiently allocate compute and memory resources based on workloads and parallelism strategies. Our evaluations show that SiPAM scales effectively with model size and I/O bandwidth, improves compute utilization across GPU and memory generations, and achieves up to 3.5×speedup in end-to-end iteration time and up to 5.46× improvement in system efficiency compared to state-of-the-art Nvidia B100 GPU systems."

    "abstract": "The Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture constitutes a significant advancement in the scalability of large- language models (LLMs), achieving better performance compared to traditional dense models with the same size of activated parameters. However, the MoE models introduce two main challenges for their edge deployment: (1) increased memory storage requirements due to the sparse parameter composition and (2) aggravated yon Neumann bottleneck caused by the inherent unpredictability of dynamic expert routing. Recent trends in state-of-the-art MoE models suggest that scaling up both activated and the total number of experts leads to better model performance. However, this multi-expert activated LLM architecture further exacerbates the aforementioned issues. To address these challenges, this paper presents a 3D stacked near-DRAM computing architecture based on available hybrid bonding and mini-TSV techniques, thereby increasing both storage capacity with the same die area and memory bandwidth for MoE models. We also employ 6T-SRAM-based Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) macros as the primary computing components and weight buffers to optimize the effective throughput of LLM inference. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid parallel computation scheme with Greedy-Swap Expert Grouping (GSEG) strategy. It balances the weight-parameter placement between tile groups in 3D-MoE architecture to enhance hardware utilization and overall performance. Through comprehensive benchmarking, the proposed accelerator demonstrates 143.10× and 68.89× speedup in token throughput, and 870.98× and 47.11× improvements in energy efficiency compared to CPU and GPU, respectively, confirming its advantages for multi-expert activated LLM inference."

Comprehending the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods. Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ models is missing in existing work.In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.

While embedded FPGAs have demonstrated performance and energy efficiency in traditional deep neural networks, their potential for LLM inference remains largely unexplored. Recent efforts to deploy LLMs on FPGAs have primarily relied on large, expensive cloud-grade hardware and have only shown promising results on relatively small LLMs, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we present Hummingbird, a novel FPGA accelerator designed specifically for LLM inference on embedded FPGAs. Hummingbird is smaller—targeting embedded FPGAs such as the KV260 and ZCU104 with 67% LUT, 39% DSP, and 42% power savings over existing research. Hummingbird is stronger—targeting LLaMA3-8B and supporting longer contexts, overcoming the typical 4GB memory constraint of embedded FPGAs through offloading strategies. Finally, Hummingbird is faster—achieving 4.8 tokens/s and 8.6 tokens/s for LLaMA3-8B on the KV260 and ZCU104 respectively, with 93-94% model bandwidth utilization, outperforming the prior 4.9 token/s for LLaMA2-7B with 84% bandwidth utilization baseline.

While Bayesian optimization shows promise, existing methods struggle with the \"curse of dimensionality.\" Inspired by expert designers’ workflow of focusing on key parameters first before gradually optimizing secondary parameters, we introduce DIVE (Dynamic Information-guided Variable Expansion), a framework that reformulates parameter optimization as an information efficiency maximization problem. Unlike approaches that explore all parameters simultaneously, DIVE progressively includes design variables with the highest information content. Our framework introduces three innovations: (1) constraint-aware weighted mutual information analysis that evaluates parameters’ contributions to objectives and constraints; (2) an adaptive variable inclusion mechanism that determines when to expand the optimization space; and (3) a mutual information-guided kernel learning strategy for Gaussian process models. Evaluations across multiple analog circuits demonstrate that DIVE achieves a 1.61×-21.11× reduction in required simulations while delivering up to 2.69× spec improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. By progressing from simple to complex parameter spaces based on information theory, DIVE establishes a new paradigm for reaching deeper optima by mimicking experienced designers’ design philosophy in circuit optimization.

Such a manual and error-prone process hinders early design space exploration due to the inherently slow RTL simulation phase, and it is unable to capture the interaction between the host application and the accelerated kernels. We propose two key improvements to the co-simulation process integrated within an HLS tool: a fast and accurate functional simulation methodology that calculates clock cycles during software execution of an annotated HLS intermediate representation, and a system-level co-simulation that couples RTL simulation with software execution of a host application through direct programming interfaces and inter-process communication. Both components augment the HLS verification process, enabling developers to extract kernels to be accelerated from a large application, quickly verify their expected performance after synthesis, and automatically validate their correctness by simulating a full host-accelerator system. Our augmented functional verification methodology is, on average, 7.0x faster than a state-of-the-art method and 36.2x faster than RTL simulation in terms of simulated cycles per second, with high accuracy and minimal memory overhead."

This primitive operation thus constitutes a significant runtime bottleneck, especially for mixed-size designs with large macros. Furthermore, this bottleneck becomes increasingly critical as the grid size in 3D placement is considerably larger than that in conventional 2D placement. In this paper, we propose an algorithm inspired by the divergence theorem to reduce the time complexity of density gradient accumulation.

    "abstract": "Collecting increasingly large image datasets is commonly viewed as essential for enhancing the accuracy of computer vision models in industrial applications. However, simply acquiring more data does not always guarantee substantial improvements in performance. An overlooked factor is the correlation between data samples, particularly when samples originate from the same production batch. Such correlation can significantly influence model accuracy. In this study, we explore the impact of 2D image correlations among samples from identical production batches, specifically examining uniformly colored lunch plates used in an industrial manufacturing scenario. Traditionally, deep learning methodologies suggest that dataset expansion directly correlates with improved detection accuracy. Contrary to this widely-held assumption, our experimental results indicate that indiscriminate data collection eventually reaches a saturation point. Through analysis, we demonstrate that carefully selecting less correlated samples—rather than simply increasing the dataset size can enhance model performance. Specifically, by strategically curating smaller but better-diversified datasets, we achieved an improvement exceeding 10% in binary accuracy on our test sets compared to larger datasets, that were not curated. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the significance of dataset quality and diversity, suggesting practical guidelines for efficient dataset construction in industrial defect detection applications. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating even an easy 2D correlation analysis into the data selection process can be more beneficial than accumulating vast volumes of less curated samples."

This way, analyses of decomposed power system elements can be conducted individually, eventually incorporating them into a statement about the whole system’s stability. The computational problem is to find lower and upper limits for the disturbance inputs so that an appropriate invariant set exists for each generator. Using the observed properties of barrier phases, an iterative procedure is proposed to find a feasible set of angular constraints. The operation of the method is illustrated on an example taken from the literature."

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent condition increasing risks for cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic disorders. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as liver biopsy, are invasive and may result in classification errors. This work explores the use of deep learning models for automated detection and evaluation of hepatic steatosis from ultrasound images, aiming for a non-invasive, accurate alternative. A segmentation model based on U-Net architecture is employed to identify regions of interest, followed by a deep neural network - EfficientNetV2 - for classification of fatty liver grades. The proposed methodology achieves high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity, demonstrating its potential as an effective tool for early detection and staging of hepatic steatosis. These findings contribute to advancing non-invasive diagnostic methods, mitigating the risks associated with biopsy, and improving patient outcomes in liver disease assessment."

    "abstract": "Dendrites are branched neuronal processes responsible for receiving synaptic inputs, while dendritic spines are small protrusions on them essential for synaptic transmission. The structural architecture of dendrites and their spines plays a pivotal role in ensuring effective neuronal connectivity and functional integration. Comprehensive characterization of dendritic morphology is fundamental for elucidating the cellular mechanisms that support memory formation and learning processes and studying brain diseases. Nonetheless, the high cost of data acquisition, difficulties in human brain samples preparation and limited availability of annotated datasets substantially constrain the application of advanced computational, analytical and artificial intelligence methods. We address the scarcity of data by developing a synthetic generation pipeline. We extract dendrites morphology features from SpineTool software derived polygonal meshes and perform modeling of dendrite shaft via K-means clustering, high-order Markov chains, and Weibull distributions. The surface is reconstructed through cylindrical segment interpolation and Poisson smoothing, with spines placed using geometric constraints. The proposed methodology has been formalized into a general algorithm for synthetic dendrite generation, enabling the creation of large-scale artificial datasets."

The article presents the results of numerical modeling of the processes of high-frequency current flow in healthy dental tissues and in tissues with carious lesions. The analysis of the obtained results made it possible to identify the influence of the area with increased conductivity on the result of measuring the impedance of the tooth. In particular, it is shown that the presence of an area with increased conductivity leads to a decrease in the resistance level by almost two times in the frequency range up to 10 kHz. At frequencies above 100 kHz, the presence of an area with increased conductivity has virtually no effect on the impedance value."

    "abstract": "The Ubiquitous adoption of domain-specific acceleration for deep neural networks (DNNs) has exposed them to security threats and memory vulnerabilities. Since performance is critical, DNN accelerators rarely employ high-overhead, authentication-based countermeasures (such as an integrity tree), making them vulnerable to integrity-based memory adversaries [1], [2]. Although recent accelerators incorporate specialized low-overhead integrity solutions, these rely on specific accelerator characteristics, making them incompatible to be used with a processor in a shared secure-memory framework.In this paper, we introduce FlexTEE, a flexible security framework that dynamically adapts to the runtime characteristics of both processor and DNN accelerator to significantly reduce Bonsai Merkle Tree (BMT)-based integrity overheads for the accelerator. The unique memory access patterns of DNN accelerators i.e., the strided access patterns caused by accelerator data tiling lead to frequent metadata accesses from the memory, causing excessive BMT utilization overhead. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel, processor-transparent, metadata address mapping scheme that reorganizes metadata-data relationship for the accelerator, transforming disjoint metadata accesses into sequential accesses for the encryption engine. This reorganization significantly reduces BMT authentication overhead for DNN accelerators with the same security guarantees. For CPU workloads, FlexTEE achieves comparable performance to conventional processor-TEE implementations with minimal resource overhead. For accelerators, FlexTEE reduces BMT verification costs by up to 87% compared to regular BMT-based accelerators. Additionally, it enhances system throughput by up to 30% on popular DNN models, outperforming state-of-the-art secure accelerators."

However, our experiments also show the 3D-stacked architecture faces severer thermal issues compared to 2D architecture, in terms of thermal temperature, gradient and scalability. To better exploit the potential of 3D-stacked architecture, we present Tasa, a heterogeneous architecture with cross-stack thermal optimizations to balance the temperature distribution and maximize the performance under the thermal constraints. High-performance core is designed for compute-intensive operations, while high-efficiency core is used for memory-intensive operators, e.g. attention layers. Furthermore, we propose a bandwidth sharing scheduling to improve the bandwidth utilization in such heterogeneous architecture. Extensive thermal experiments show that our Tasa architecture demonstrates greater scalability compared with the homogeneous 3D-stacked architecture, i.e. up to 5.55 °C, 9.37 °C, and 7.91 °C peak temperature reduction for 48, 60, and 72 core configurations.

    "abstract": "Wireless charging systems for electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a key enabler for sustainable transportation, offering enhanced convenience, safety, and system integration compared to traditional plug-in charging methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies, highlighting their operating principles, system architecture, and recent advancements in both static and dynamic charging applications. Various WPT techniques, including inductive, capacitive, magnetic gear, and resonant inductive methods, are analyzed with respect to frequency range, efficiency, electromagnetic interference, and suitability for electric vehicle wireless charging systems (EVWCS). Emphasis is placed on compensation topologies such as series–series (SS), series–parallel (SP), parallel–parallel (PP), and hybrid LCC/LCL networks, which are instrumental in mitigating power fluctuations and improving efficiency under coil misalignment conditions. Moreover, control strategies—ranging from proportional–integral and passivity-based approaches to model predictive and sliding-mode control—are reviewed for their role in enhancing system stability and dynamic response. The integration of artificial intelligence, edge computing, and dual-side control architectures is also discussed as a pathway toward adaptive and intelligent power management in dynamic wireless charging systems (DWCS). Finally, the paper examines environmental, economic, and grid-integration considerations, concluding that the continued evolution of hybrid compensation networks and intelligent control algorithms will pave the way for efficient, scalable, and autonomous wireless charging infrastructure for next-generation EVs."

    "abstract": "The Multivariate Multifractal Spectrum (MV-MFS) theory characterizes joint multifractal properties in multivariate signals. However, existing MV-MFS estimation algorithms, such as those based on wavelet leaders and probabilistic measures, suffer from low accuracy for short sequences and are sensitive to data trends. To address these issues, we propose a detrended fluctuation analysis-based multivariate multifractal spectrum estimation algorithm (DFA-MVMFS). This involves constructing a bivariate joint root mean square (BJ-RMS) function, deriving a bivariate joint scaling function from the partial derivatives of the BJ-RMS function, obtaining the bivariate multifractal surface spectrum via multivariate Legendre transform, and extending to the multivariate case. Experimental validation using binomial multiplicative cascades and IPIX radar data demonstrates the superiority of the proposed DFA-MVMFS over benchmarks, and further classification experiments based on the spectrum features using a ResNet network confirm its effectiveness; notably, on 1024-point short sequences, DFA-MVMFS achieves approximately 14% higher detection accuracy compared to WL-MVMFS. Furthermore, DFA-MVMFS analysis highlights its potential for target detection in IPIX radar signals."

Regarding privacy-preserving, a new two-stage pre-training personalized federated learning framework is proposed to train customized forecasting models with high forecasting accuracy for all households without violating their data privacy. As for the missing data problem, an advanced semi-supervised graph diffusion network model is proposed to address missing “features” and “labels” problems, where “features” and “labels” refer to the required input data of the forecasting model and actual load data of the forecasting day, respectively. Mathematically, a graph feature diffusion mechanism-based feature input and imputation module is developed to mitigate the deficiency imposed by missing “features”. Next, a graph convolutional network-based semi-supervised feature augmented and update module is established to mitigate the negative effects of missing “labels”. An actual power system in China is employed to demonstrate the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that high forecasting accuracy and strong robustness under missing data scenarios are achieved."

While the visualization community has proposed generalizable frameworks, there is a growing need for domain-aware methodologies that address discipline-specific challenges and refine design study practices. To investigate how domain characteristics and collaborator roles influence the design study process, we conducted interviews with 15 experts, including domain specialists from the humanities, arts, applied sciences, and artificial intelligence, as well as visualization researchers and developers, with direct experience in design studies. Our findings reveal tensions and opportunities that arise from differing expectations, communication styles, and levels of engagement among collaborators at various stages of the design process, including problem formulation, co-design, and evaluation. We highlight how domain-specific norms and role dynamics shape collaboration and influence the trajectory of visualization projects. Based on these insights, we offer practical considerations to help visualization researchers anticipate domain-specific challenges, foster mutual understanding, and adapt their methods accordingly.

Existing offloading approaches often fail to achieve age-critical resource allocation in dynamic satellite-integrated Internet, potentially leading to outdated information and inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we propose an age-critical joint communication and computation offloading scheme, where low Earth orbit satellites cover several base stations and many ground users. Then, we formulate a comprehensive optimization problem, which aims to minimize the average peak age of information (PAoI), subject to energy consumption constraints. We propose an online Lyapunov-enhanced decoupled actor-critic (LDA) scheme. Specifically, our LDA scheme decomposes the original long-term problem into manageable per-frame subproblems. It employs a deep neural network integrated with an order-preserving quantization approach to effectively decouple offloading decisions, and utilizes low-complexity iterative algorithms for resource allocation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our LDA scheme substantially reduces the average PAoI compared to the related deep reinforcement learning schemes, while satisfying energy consumption constraints and reducing up to 25% complexity."

    "abstract": "Effective data governance is critical for organizations striving to leverage data as a strategic asset, yet standardized frameworks for assessing data governance capabilities remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, this study presents a Data Governance Process Capability Model (DG-PCM) grounded in the ISO/IEC 330xx standards. Building on a well-accepted Design Science Research (DSR) approach, the study develops and evaluates the DG-PCM as the designed artifact. The DSR framework guided the integration of complementary methods—including literature review, Modified-Delphi analysis, and case study—to iteratively design, validate, and refine the model. Developed through a systematic, multi-stage research approach, the model synthesizes insights from a comprehensive review of 326 academic studies and the practical perspectives of industry experts obtained via the Delphi method. The DG-PCM structures data governance processes into four primary domains—Data, Organization, Strategy, and Technology—encompassing eighteen distinct processes, each evaluated across six capability levels, from Level 0 (Not Performed) to Level 5 (Innovating). To assess the model’s practical relevance, a case study conducted within a manufacturing organization validated its utility in aligning data governance practices with broader organizational goals. This structured approach not only fills a critical gap in the literature but also provides a standardized, unbiased, and comprehensive framework for assessing data governance maturity. The findings indicate that the DG-PCM offers a robust foundation for continuous improvement, strategic alignment, and data-driven decision-making, positioning it as a vital tool for organizations seeking to enhance their data governance capabilities in an increasingly data-centric environment."

This review article summarizes research achievements from 2021 to 2025 focused on liquid and solid dielectric innovations for power transformer applications. Significant advances have been made in the field of liquid insulation using natural and synthetic esters, nanofluids and bio-based oils. Compared to traditional mineral oils, these materials provide higher biodegradability, increased fire safety, more dielectric strength and superior thermal conductivity. Innovations in solid insulating materials such as cellulose nanocomposites, aramid-infused pressboards and biomaterials infused with polymers are reviewed highlighting improvements in mechanical strength, moisture resistance and thermal durability. It also focuses on diagnostic approaches, predictive maintenance and testing methodologies. The study emphasizes the role of nanoparticles and environmentally suitable replacements in power transformer insulating systems.

This approach offers a unified framework for managing complex interactions between subsystems, enabling enhanced safety, performance and adaptability features. However, practical implementation and widespread diffusion of this technology remain a significant challenge due to the lack of standardized strategies and heterogeneity of components, with a significant gap between academic descriptions and automotive industry practices became evident through analysis of over 300 sources from scientific literature, industrial patents, and OEM documentation. This work aims to investigate the applicability of IVDC within existing vehicle architectures and address the need for a real-time adaptive control solution. A systematic examination of subsystem coupling mechanisms, industrial applications and the influence of different vehicle morphologies on the choice of control architecture are discussed. Moreover, alternative approaches, such as decoupled control and multi-agent systems, are introduced as potential solutions to overcome limitations of conventional coordination schemes. Finally, emerging perspectives on system adaptability, with particular emphasis on stability-oriented design and the enabling role of Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, are discussed. Even considering a limited availability of comparable quantitative metrics from OEMs due to proprietary considerations, the overall intention is to provide a comprehensive and pragmatic outlook on the evolving boundaries of IVDC, based on rate of usage metric as a function of actuator type and availability, considering its alignment with current and future market demands."

Combining literature review, data gathering, regression analysis, and comparative analysis, a sample of eighteen representative cryptocurrencies was selected based on activity from high volume exchanges among the top 100 by market capitalization and the weekly trading data was collected for the last five years of all the coins to examine. Explicit results demonstrate that when describing the relationship between risk premiums of certain cryptocurrencies and market risk premiums, the CAPM is successful, but struggles to explain the financial returns of specific coins. After this, the three-factor model application in the crypto market was examined and then compared to CAPM performance. The study concludes that the value and momentum factors provided a better explanation of returns."

In the context of the increasing need for early diagnostic methods, the use of convolutional neural networks is proposed to extract and interpret relevant emotional features. The system seeks to correlate expressive patterns with psychiatric conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders. The goal is to adapt these neural networks to accurately interpret emotional fluctuations and subtle expressions indicative of changes in mental states.

    "abstract": "Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) is a prevailing kernel in scientific and artificial intelligence applications. However, the irregular memory access behaviors caused by diverse sparse patterns in SpMM lead to a significant performance bottleneck for traditional computing platforms, driving the demand for dedicated hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, the existing hardware accelerators are not flexible enough to handle diverse SpMM workloads due to their rigid task dispatch schemes, limiting the overall performance.To address the challenge, this paper introduces ScanNow, a scan window-based SpMM accelerator design. ScanNow first presents a scan window-based task dispatch scheme designed to minimize the time-consuming irregular memory access behaviors by exploiting potential data reuse opportunities. The proposed task dispatch scheme effectively and dynamically balances input and output data reuse for row-wise dataflow according to real-time sparse patterns. Moreover, a tailored hardware architecture, featuring multiple memory components and customized schedulers, is proposed to accommodate the task dispatch scheme and improve computation parallelism. Experiments demonstrate that ScanNow achieves an average speedup of 1.67x across a wide range of SpMM workloads compared to the state-of-the-art hardware accelerator."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demand high memory bandwidth and computational efficiency, posing significant challenges for deployment on traditional digital accelerators. Analog Compute-in-Memory (ACIM) architectures offer an attractive alternative by co-locating storage and computation to reduce data movement. However, executing LLMs on ACIM systems remains challenging due to hardware non-idealities and the unique statistical properties of LLM inputs and outputs in FC layers. In particular, long-tailed data distributions containing large-amplitude \"salient values\" degrade analog signal quality under quantization and system noise. In this work, we propose SAGE (Saliency-Aware Grouping for Efficient Mapping), a training-free strategy that improves noise resilience by reordering weight and input channels of FC layers based on statistical characteristics of LLMs. We identify kurtosis as a key factor affecting analog robustness and develop a saliency-aware mapping method that reduces output kurtosis to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. We further introduce a reconfigurable tile design that supports mixed-precision execution and maximizes array utilization across layers. Evaluations on multiple LLMs and benchmarks show that SAGE significantly improves inference accuracy and energy efficiency based on ACIM simulation without requiring retraining."

    "abstract": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit’s design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants."

Harnessing the customizability of the open-source RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), we present an automated methodology to accelerate activation functions in quantized long short-term memory (LSTM) networks through custom functional units as hardware extensions. One common approach to accelerate the computation of activation functions is to use approximation techniques, such as function tables, which enable a fast lookup but are, in turn, memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we analyze execution profiles of LSTM networks and present a flexible method for generating and exploring table-based function approximation. In order to reflect memory constraints, we propose splitting the input range of computationally expensive activation functions, such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent, into intervals using different quantization granularities for each subinterval. Our open-source design flow includes simulation-based verification, synthesis, placement, routing, and compilation. The results highlight the potential of table-based acceleration by addressing trade-offs between memory demand and accuracy, and provide an efficient hardware/software co-design solution for AI applications."

Unfortunately, current solutions face challenges in addressing this trend. They either depend on costly, inflexible dedicated accelerators or utilize general-purpose hardware with inferior performance. This limitation underscores the urgent need for a unified architecture capable of serving both normal and privacy-sensitive users with high efficiency.However, the fundamental disparities in computation patterns and resource management between NPI and PI make their architectural fusion intricate. To bridge this gap, we explore their inherent similarities and apply fine-grained reconfiguration to maximize resource sharing. We propose RTPU, a reconfigurable multi-core architecture that can seamlessly switch between tensor-based plaintext and polynomial ring-based ciphertext computations. Building upon its reconfigurable computing fabric and parallelization mechanism, we introduce a kernel group-based scheduling strategy to optimize hardware utilization and QoS. Experimental results show that: i) The RTPU architecture achieves near-ASIC performance and beyond-ASIC flexibility with substantial silicon reuse between NPI and PI. ii) The RTPU scheduler sustains high resource utilization for multi-tenant workloads with varying privacy requirements."

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose severe threats to the integrity of deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in resource-constrained systems where traditional defenses are computationally expensive. While existing defenses in the black-box setting utilize hardware characteristics of adversarial attacks (like Hardware Performance Counter or HPC measurements), these defenses often involve repeating execution of multiple target model inferences to detect the attacks.In this work, we put forth a differing perspective: while detection strategies involving multiple target model inferences appear to be successful in isolation, they have unacceptable and inhibitory requirements. Precisely, we argue that these works require cleaning the micro-architectural state of hardware like the cache and the branch predictor after each inference. This in turn leads to performance degradation of not only the adversarial attack detector, but also of the overall system at large.In this work, we put forth a novel and lightweight detection strategy, MIRAGE, using HPCs that does not require cleaning the micro-architectural state of caches or branch predictors. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on these signals to classify inputs as benign or adversarial in a single shot, making our approach practical for online systems, while allowing full use of hardware optimizations for performance uplifts. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets reveal that our methodology not only detects adversarial samples effectively with greater than 96% accuracy, but also imposes a minimal timing overhead of 60 ms and maintains high throughput. This makes our solution well-suited for embedded and edge-AI scenarios."

In this paper, we present NUA-Timer, a novel pre-synthesis timing prediction framework designed to address the unique challenges posed by NUIAT in hierarchical timing prediction. To capture the complex long-range timing dependencies under varying NUIAT, NUA-Timer employs a novel bidirectional propagation neural network (BPN), which enables the quantification of timing dependencies using a correlation matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a tailored loss function that leverages post-synthesis critical path labels, thereby aligning the correlation matrix with actual post-synthesis timing dependencies.

By accounting for these wave effects, and correcting for non-geophysical artifacts such as antenna electronic mis-pointing, satellite attitude variations, and azimuthal scalloping, we derive radial current velocities from SAR observations.

While many efforts have been made to alleviate the impact of handovers on service provisioning from NTNs, they usually assume channel conditions are pre-determined and remain unchanged as satellites move, which is different from real situations and thus may experience significant performance degradation compared to theoretical analysis.

To accommodate the dynamic nature of NTNs, we introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based controller to predict future network status and generate control strategies correspondingly, and leverage Digital Twin (DT) for real-time network status consideration.

To address these challenges, technological interventions have previously been developed to alleviate stress, enhance cognitive functioning and overall well-being. Tools such as mobile devices, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) applications have shown promise in supporting and advancing clinical practices by utilizing sensory-based technologies. In this paper, an extension of a published 2023 survey, we present the second phase of research concerning a series of semi-structured interviews with autistic participants and caregivers. We report on the identification of currently used technological preferences, and the perceived potential for new technologies. Coping mechanisms employed and reactions to stress are detailed, trigger locations and stressful scenarios are identified, as well as masking techniques used by autistic adults. The results from the study have identified interest in developing new applications based on existing technologies, with aural sensitivity identified as the main stimuli that needs managed. Participants highlighted the importance of planning as a coping mechanism, and indicated that familiarity, in audio and visual feedback, helps to calm participants in times of stress. Respondents commented on existing forms of audio-visual distractors used by autistic people to cope with stressful scenarios, for example, the use of music, and stimming, which could be employed within potential applications to reduce stress. The overarching goal of this research is to address the question, ‘How can the potentially debilitating effects of stress in autistic adults be mitigated by a self-customizable approach to the design of accessible technologies?’ The insights gained will inform future research regarding the design of technological self-interventions for stress management in autistic adults. The findings further identify practical design requirements such as adaptive audio masking, context-aware planning tools, and customizable multimodal feedback to support real-time stress regulation."

The algorithm comprises two primary blocks: a comprehensive pre-processing stage, including stabilization, illumination correction, and background component removal; and a time-frequency analysis based on the Fourier transform, followed by the calculation of a Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) map. The proposed approach enables the identification of pixels corresponding to dynamic intensity variations and can be utilized for the analysis of temporal changes in images. The developed algorithm can be applied in diagnostic tasks requiring analysis of the temporal dynamics of intensity in image arrays. The algorithm’s efficacy was successfully demonstrated in three applications: diagnosis of dermatographic urticaria, investigation of microcirculation during Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), and mapping the microcirculatory network of nevi."

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease that is widespread all over the world. Early diagnosis of this disease can significantly improve the effectiveness of the applied immunomodulatory therapy. As signs of the possible development of multiple sclerosis in its early stages, it is proposed to use a comprehensive assessment of the preservation of a number of indicators of the body’s sensory sensitivity: its visual, motor and auditory functions. A special role in this case is played by the assessment of the preservation of the characteristics of visual perception. The research objectives include identification of reliably significant changes in visual perception indicators characterizing the early stages of the development of demyelination of nerve fibers; development of a biotechnological technique for early detection of signs of multiple sclerosis based on indicators of the visual system; development of a software package for evaluating the characteristics of a visual analyzer. It is proposed to identify visual impairments of various types characteristic of the early stages of the development of multiple sclerosis by evaluating the contrast characteristics of visual perception using color visocontrastometry. In this case, it is proposed to use an increased color depth of the generated test stimuli. The study of contrast sensitivity in multiple sclerosis is one of the sensitive methods of early diagnosis of this disease or detection of its asymptomatic course. A module for automated assessment of visual function safety has been developed for use as an element of a biotechnical system for early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis."

The possibility of continuous recording of the microcirculatory-tissue systems parameters of cosmonauts’ organisms simultaneously at 4 points (symmetrical areas of the basins of the supraorbital arteries and the upper thirds of the inner surfaces of the shins) was demonstrated. All subjects tolerated the load well and did not experience discomfort. The detected changes in skin perfusion and the normalized amplitude of NADH fluorescence reflect the work of adaptive mechanisms for maintaining homeostasis in response to blood redistribution. After the end of the test, when returning to the horizontal position, there is a general increase in blood microcirculation both in the area of the forehead and shins, that characterizes the recovery of the body.

Traditional point cloud-based reconstruction methods often rely on surface normals, and the presence of missing data and noise poses significant challenges for accurate reconstruction. In this paper, we propose GS2Poly, a textured polygonal mesh reconstruction method for buildings based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework. Firstly, 3DGS of the building scene is reconstructed under planar structure constraints. A density-weighted Gaussian sampling method is utilized to sample high-quality surface point clouds and extract planar primitives from 3DGS reconstruction results. Next, GS2Poly applies an adaptive spatial partitioning strategy to generate a set of candidate convex polyhedra. Finally, guided by the Gaussian opacity field, a Markov random field is constructed to extract the polygonal mesh surface, followed by high-fidelity texture mapping using an optimal rendering strategy. Experimental results across diverse building scenarios demonstrate that GS2Poly exhibits higher geometric fidelity than spatial partitioning-based or 3DGS-based mesh simplification methods. Additionally, the proposed texture mapping strategy effectively avoids typical texture artifacts such as occlusion, seams and distortions."

While decoupling capacitors (decaps) serve as the primary solution for suppressing power delivery network (PDN) noise, determining their optimal values and placement remains computationally prohibitive using traditional methods. This aritcle introduces ConvGA, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) with genetic algorithms to revolutionize PDN decap optimization. At the heart of ConvGA is a specialized CNN architecture trained on comprehensive boundary element method (BEM) simulations, enabling ultra-fast impedance prediction for arbitrary PCB configurations. Our CNN achieves remarkable accuracy while reducing impedance computation time from hours to mere milliseconds—a 500× speedup over conventional BEM calculations. This acceleration enables the genetic algorithm to efficiently explore vast design spaces through adaptive population control and dynamic constraint mechanisms, systematically minimizing both the number of required capacitors and the deviation from target impedance. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale PDNs demonstrate that ConvGA achieves a 15× reduction in optimization time while requiring 30% fewer capacitors compared to state-of-the-art methods, consistently producing high-quality solutions across diverse PDN configurations."

Firstly, the speed loop adopts an anti-windup controller, which effectively solves the integral saturation problem of the motor during acceleration/deceleration through the conditional integration and feedback compensation mechanism, and further improves the dynamic response and steady state performance of the system. Secondly, to address the problems of high-frequency chattering and fixed gain caused by the degradation of estimation accuracy when the conventional sliding mode observer operates in a wide speed domain, the designed GA-STSMO significantly improves the observation accuracy of rotor position and speed by dynamically adjusting the sliding mode gain and combining with the super-twisting algorithm (STA) to suppress the high-frequency chattering. Finally, through a series of experiments, various performance comparisons are made between the proposed scheme and the conventional control scheme. The experimental results on a DTP-PMSM demonstrate the superiority and feasibility of the proposed scheme in sensorless control system. This study provides a solution for the position sensorless control of multiphase motors that balances high accuracy and stability, which is suitable for aerospace, electric vehicles and other high-reliability fields."

While vision-based methods offer high performance, they introduce significant privacy concerns. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensors provide a privacy-preserving alternative. However, their sparse and noisy data present a performance challenge, and the complexity of deep learning models hinders their deployment on resource-constrained Microcontroller Units (MCUs). This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to address these interconnected challenges. We propose a lightweight Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) for mmWave point cloud data, enhanced through a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation methodology. In our framework, a high-performance teacher model, trained on rich skeleton joint data, guides the training of a compact student model that operates solely on mmWave data during inference. This approach is augmented by a multi-faceted lightweighting strategy, including architectural tuning, post-training quantization, and a principled removal of residual connections, which drastically reduces the peak memory footprint to meet MCU constraints. The robustness and generalizability of our framework are validated through extensive experiments on two distinct datasets. On the DGUHA dataset, our method improves accuracy by up to 7.46%. Critically, on the large-scale and complex MilliPoint benchmark, our framework demonstrates consistent performance gains, improving accuracy by up to 7.89%. The final, optimized model is successfully deployed on a commercial MCU, showing its practical viability for real-time, accurate, and privacy-conscious HAR on edge devices."

This paper presents a Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) developed for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist, integrated into the ’PRISMA HAND II’ prosthetic hand. The primary objective of our research is to design an adaptive controller that facilitates wrist movements eliminating external disturbances while minimizing computational requirements. To achieve this, kinematic and dynamic models of the wrist are developed based on the Piece-wise Constant Curvature (PCC) hypothesis. The controller consists of a reference model generated using the PCC model, and state errors are evaluated by comparing the responses of the reference model to those of the wrist model. These errors are reduced using the MRAC approach to make the wrist’s behavior closely align with that of the reference model. Stability of the closed-loop system is ensured using the Lyapunov direct method, along with the ’New Theorem of Stability’, a replacement for Barbalat’s lemma, ensuring that the error between the reference model and the actual system converges to zero and that the adaptive gains stabilize to fixed values. The adaptive performance of the controller is evaluated through experimental validations, where the motions of the prosthetic hand attached to the wrist are treated as unknown disturbances, and the mechanical stiffness of the wrist is considered as an uncertain parameter, resulting from the degradation of the internal springs."

    "abstract": "Fiber optic vibration sensors are widely used in extreme environments such as aerospace and energy equipment for structural health monitoring due to their resistance to electromagnetic interference, corrosion, and high temperatures. Traditional fiber Bragg grating (FBG) or Fabry–Pérot (F–P) vibration sensors are often used to measure a single physical parameter, so they can encounter some challenges such as limited measurement accuracy, significant influence of temperature perturbation, and inability to self-calibration. Here, we propose a high-temperature dual-parameter self-calibrating fiber-optic vibration sensor by integrating an F–P resonant cavity with a dual FBGs structure in a double-cantilever beam sensitive diaphragm to simultaneously obtain two vibration signals from the same location. Two sets of FBGs with different periods are inscribed in the fiber core by using a femtosecond laser. One FBG is attached to a silicon-based diaphragm for vibration sensing, while the other is attached to the surface of the sensor package for temperature measurement and compensation. The F–P cavity is composed of the fiber end face with the diaphragm to sense vibration signal. The recombination-type sensor has outstanding optical responses from room temperature to 500°C. And it has a high measurement accuracy of 0.1 g for weak signals and a large dynamic measurement range of 0.1–2000 g for strong vibration. Moreover, the two types of vibration sensors can be mutually calibrated in different application environments. Therefore, this study provides a self-calibrating solution for vibration sensing in high-temperature and strong-vibration environments, expanding the applicability of fiber optic sensing technology under extreme conditions."

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying miRNA-disease association (MDA) is of great importance in biomedical research and clinical applications. However, most existing computational methods rely on similarity, making it difficult to effectively capture the deep semantic information among heterogeneous nodes in complex networks. In addition, the inherent “black-box” nature of traditional deep learning models leads to a lack of transparency in their decision-making process. Therefore, we propose an interpretable MDA prediction method (iDRKAN) based on dual-graph representation learning and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. First, iDRKAN constructs similarity views and meta-path views based on the similarity matrix and association matrix respectively, and learns higher-order feature representation of each view by graph convolutional network (GCN). Subsequently, the multi-channel attention (MCA) mechanism is introduced to adaptively fuse the contextual information of each similarity view in different convolutional layers, and the semantic layer attention (SLA) mechanism is used to integrate the semantic information contained in different meta-path views. Next, the contrastive learning strategy is used to optimize the consistency between the dual-graph representation. Finally, the dual-graph features are weighted fused, and fed into the interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for prediction. Experimental results on two public datasets show that iDRKAN significantly outperforms existing computational approaches in multiple performance indicators. In addition, experiments with different classifiers verify that iDRKAN achieves a good balance between prediction performance and interpretability. The case study further demonstrates the effectiveness of iDRKAN in mining potential associations."

    "abstract": "Approximate computing offers promising energy efficiency benefits for error-tolerant applications, but discovering optimal approximations requires extensive design space exploration (DSE). Predicting the accuracy of circuits composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming.This paper presents ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks, utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54% better with fast fine-tuning. The proposed methodology effectively addresses the challenge of transferring knowledge across different circuit designs without requiring expensive retraining. We provide our implementation, including the graph generation tools and pretrained models, as an open-source library to facilitate further research in this area."

    "abstract": "In current 5G massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular networks, the performance of beamforming hinges critically on the accuracy of downlink channel state information (CSI), particularly in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The absence of channel reciprocity in FDD systems introduces notable challenges, resulting in substantial communication overhead when transmitting downlink CSI directly. To tackle this obstacle, a limited feedback strategy is adopted to compress the downlink CSI into a manageable number of bits. Nevertheless, this compression complicates the accurate retrieval of downlink CSI, reducing the beamforming performance. This paper thoroughly examines the limited feedback mechanism, scrutinizing its structural design and the values it generates. Drawing upon these insights, we introduce an online algorithm that alternates between exploration and estimation to enhance beamforming for single-stream and multi-stream configurations. Our proposed method significantly elevates beamforming vector quality by adeptly decoding downlink CSI from the limited feedback. Additionally, it leverages existing information to refine the feedback process, leading to the generation of more precise CSI. As numerical results demonstrate, the complementary nature of estimation and exploration leads to outstanding performance in optimal beamforming acquisition."

    "abstract": "LLM inference on mobile devices faces extraneous challenges due to limited memory bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, speculative inference and processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have been explored at the algorithmic and hardware levels. However, speculative inference results in more compute-intensive GEMM operations, creating new design trade-offs for existing GEMV-accelerated PIM architectures. Furthermore, there exists a significant amount of redundant draft tokens in tree-based speculative inference, necessitating efficient token management schemes to minimize energy consumption. In this work, we present LP-Spec, an architecture-dataflow co-design leveraging hybrid LPDDR5 performance-enhanced PIM architecture with draft token pruning and dynamic workload scheduling to accelerate LLM speculative inference. A near-data memory controller is proposed to enable data reallocation between DRAM and PIM banks. Furthermore, a data allocation unit based on the hardware-aware draft token pruner is developed to minimize energy consumption and fully exploit parallel execution opportunities. Compared to end-to-end LLM inference on other mobile solutions such as mobile NPUs or GEMV-accelerated PIMs, our LP-Spec achieves 13.21× , 7.56 ×, and 99.87× improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and energy-delay-product (EDP). Compared with prior AttAcc PIM and RTX 3090 GPU, LP-Spec can obtain 12.83× and 415.31× EDP reduction benefits."

Recent studies show that lowering the precision of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) in crossbar peripheral circuits can significantly reduce system area and power overheads at the risk of increasing quantization-induced numerical errors that degrade inference accuracy. This paper proposes a Boundary-Aware Regularized Quantization (BARQ) technique to maintain accuracy in CIM accelerators with low-precision ADCs. BARQ introduces ADC bit-width boundary constraints to regulate model weights during quantization-aware training (QAT), mitigating overflow-induced clipping errors and enhancing unstructured weight sparsity. Additionally, we introduce a novel weight initialization strategy based on Euclidean projection, which minimizes initial quantization error and facilitates faster and more stable convergence. Experiments on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets show that BARQ achieves minimal accuracy loss of only 0.59% even with 3-bit ADCs. Furthermore, by enhancing weight sparsity, BARQ further reduces energy consumption by up to 75% and improves hardware efficiency by 3.79× compared to conventional quantization methods."

The approach focuses on two classes of representations - list-mode and binned-mode collections for sets of random points (counts) when registering weak radiation. The representation problem within the proposed approach is treated as a problem of an effective tradeoff between image noise reduction and edge preservation."

    "abstract": "Thermal management in large-scale unstructured 2.5D ICs faces the challenges due to the integration of complex geometries and heterogeneous materials. Existing deep learning (DL) methods urgently require a memory-efficient and high-fidelity unstructured representation method for multiscale complex ICs to simultaneously model macroscopic components and microscopic structure. Moreover, it further needs to achieve multiscale geometric thermal feature capture and thermal distribution difference adaptation among heterogeneous materials. Combining a multiscale unstructured point-cloud representation, this paper introduces Therm-PCT, a geometry-material aware point-cloud transformer framework to achieve high-accuracy thermal and its gradient prediction. Therm-PCT incorporates three key modules: adaptive multipath-coupled diffusion (AMD), a wavelet-based fine-grained recovery (WFR), and a thermal-aware Mixture-of-Material-Experts (TA-MoME) adapter. AMD adaptively learns heat diffusion path interaction with serialization-gate-based attention. Furthermore, the WFR module recovers fine-grained thermal gradients through high-frequency wavelet domain enhancement, and the TA-MoME adapter adapts to heterogeneous material by dynamically routing material-specific experts. Experiments demonstrate that the Thermal-PCT’s accuracy performance metric improvements are substantial, outperforming the newly proposed method FSA-Heat, by considerable margins of 78.03%, 84.00%, 67.61%, and 78.25% in 80 K-scale point clouds. It also achieves a 147× speed-up compared to the commercial software COMSOL. Additionally, Therm-PCT shows the potential of zero-shot generalization up to 0.4 M-scale points (5.7× than training scale) and robust performance on unseen geometric shapes."

While IC camouflaging has emerged to mitigate these risks, existing approaches largely focus on localized gate modifications, neglecting comprehensive deception strategies. To address this gap, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven methodology – IP Camouflage – that integrates cryptic and mimetic deception principles to enhance IC security against RE. Our approach leverages a novel And-Inverter Graph Variational Autoencoder (AIG-VAE) to encode circuit representations, enabling dual-layered camouflage through functional preservation and appearance mimicry. By introducing new variants of covert gates – Fake Inverters, Fake Buffers, and Universal Transmitters – our methodology achieves robust protection by obscuring circuit functionality while presenting misleading appearances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in maintaining circuit functionality while achieving strong resistance to SAT-based attacks with low structural overhead. Additionally, we validate the robustness of our method against advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based RE attacks."

Experiments on balanced and imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the grayscale early fusion configuration consistently outperforms gradient fusion and standard RGB-only approaches. The grayscale configuration particularly excels in distinguishing between visually similar road surfaces and shows enhanced robustness to imbalanced class distributions.

Consequently, their estimation accuracy deteriorates under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In contrast, the adaptive weighted least squares (AWLS) method accounts for noise. Its accuracy, however, deteriorates under highly nonuniform sampling conditions. Although the maximum normalized image sharpness (MNIS) algorithm achieves high estimation accuracy, it suffers from high computational complexity. To address these limitations, novel phase error estimation methods based on weighted subspace fitting are proposed. The proposed methods explicitly account for noise by constructing two weighted fitting models between the subspace and the steering vector, from which phase errors are estimated via optimal solutions. Depending on the employed subspace, the proposed methods are classified as weighted signal subspace fitting (WSSF) and weighted noise subspace fitting (WNSF). Simulations and airborne experiments verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methods."

To reduce the unavoidable charging wait times faced by private electric cars (PECs) during intercity long-distance travel, caused by their limited driving range and slow charging speeds, this paper explores an optimization model that leverages backhaul empty electric trucks (BEETs) as temporary mobile chargers to increase the service capacity of fixed charging stations. To address the optimization of BEETs serving PECs, we first construct a model in which all BEETs are guaranteed profits, while jointly maximizing their profits and overall social benefits. Due to the inclusion of nonlinear terms, the model falls under the category of Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). To enable efficient computation, we propose a model transformation method based on time discretization, converting the original MINLP into a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. Case study results from Sichuan Province, China, demonstrate that BEETs, by proactively detouring to offer charging services, can significantly reduce PECs’ cumulative waiting time. The system delivers a high social benefit-to-cost ratio, underscoring the dual role of BEETs as both profit-generating assets and effective delay-reduction tools without requiring additional infrastructure. Sensitivity analyses offer systematic managerial insights for addressing future development trends."

Specifically, we propose a joint optimization framework that jointly optimizes compression strategy selection and computing resource allocation, with the aim of minimizing long-term end-to-end delay. However, the optimization problem is a mixed integer non-convex problem with coupled variables, making it difficult to obtain the global optimal solution. To solve the problem, we firstly apply Lyapunov optimization theory to decompose the long-term problem into the deterministic sub-problem in each slot. Subsequently, the compression selection variables are decoupled from the resource allocation variables, and the resource allocation variables are solved via convex optimization to obtain a dimensionality-reduced Markov decision process (MDP) problem. An intensive reward reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to address the reward sparsity problem in the MDP. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves performance and reduces the average delay compared to the benchmarks."

This paper proposes a blind hyperspectral unmixing method integrating Recurrent Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Segment Anything Model (SAM) adapter. The method operates through three sequential stages: feature encoding, endmember extraction, and abundance estimation. Specifically for feature encoding, a HU-SAM adapter is proposed to capture global-local spatial features. For endmember extraction, an iteratively learned Recurrent-KAN module reconstructs endmembers while stabilizing model learning. For abundance estimation, an updated Swin Transformer module is utilized to maintain a lower parameter count. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate superior effectiveness of the proposed method over the eight state-of-the-art methods."

Given the high volume of issue reports in large-scale projects, manually assigning issues is tedious and costly. Previous studies have proposed automated issue assignment approaches that primarily focus on modeling issue report textual information, developers’ expertise, or interactions between issues and developers based on historical issue-fixing records. However, these approaches often suffer from performance limitations due to the presence of incorrect and missing labels in OSS datasets, as well as the long tail of developer contributions and the changes in developer activity as the project evolves. To address these challenges, we propose IssueCourier, a novel Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network approach for issue assignment. Specifically, we formalize five key relationships among issues, developers, and source code files to construct a heterogeneous graph. Then, we further adopt a temporal slicing technique that partitions the graph into a sequence of time-based subgraphs to learn stage-specific patterns. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark dataset with relabeled ground truth to address the problem of incorrect and missing labels in existing OSS datasets. Finally, to evaluate the performance of IssueCourier, we conduct extensive experiments on our benchmark dataset. The results show that IssueCourier can improve over the best baseline up to 45.49% in top-1 and 31.97% in MRR."

Flotation processes involve nonlinear, time-dependent interactions among diverse, multi-source variables, posing significant challenges for conventional models in capturing high-order spatiotemporal dependencies essential for accurate prediction. To overcome these limitations, we design an adaptive hypergraph construction mechanism based on sliding time windows, enabling effective representation of evolving correlations among process parameters. For temporal modeling, the Informer module employs a sparse self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies, while the GRU component focuses on short-term fluctuations induced by operational variations. This cascaded Informer-GRU structure facilitates multi-scale feature fusion, tailored to the dynamic behavior of flotation systems. Extensive experiments conducted on an industrial-grade flotation dataset and two public benchmarks demonstrate that DHIG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly modeling structural dynamics and temporal hierarchies, providing a robust and scalable solution for intelligent flotation process monitoring and grade forecasting."

However, mapping the relationship between design choices and reader conclusions often requires labor-intensive crowdsourced studies, generating large corpora of free-response text for analysis. To address this challenge, we explored alternative scalable research methodologies to assess chart affordances. We test four elicitation methods from human-subject studies: free response, visualization ranking, conclusion ranking, and salience rating, and compare their effectiveness in eliciting reader interpretations of line charts, dot plots, and heatmaps. Overall, we find that while no method fully replicates affordances observed in free-response conclusions, combinations of ranking and rating methods can serve as an effective proxy at a broad scale. The two ranking methodologies were influenced by participant bias towards certain chart types and the comparison of suggested conclusions. Rating conclusion salience could not capture the specific variations between chart types observed in the other methods. To supplement this work, we present a case study with GPT-4o, exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) to elicit human-like chart interpretations. This aligns with recent academic interest in leveraging LLMs as proxies for human participants to improve data collection and analysis efficiency. GPT-4o performed best as a human proxy for the salience rating methodology but suffered from severe constraints in other areas. Overall, the discrepancies in affordances we found between various elicitation methodologies, including GPT-4o, highlight the importance of intentionally selecting and combining methods and evaluating trade-offs."

    "abstract": "In conventional VSG-DFIG systems, the control of the rotor-side converter relies on fixed PI parameters, which is limited by linearized modeling and exhibits insufficient suppression of subsynchronous oscillations (SSO) under complex operating conditions. To enhance the dynamic adaptability and robustness of DFIG, this paper proposes a VSG-DFIG control strategy based on adaptive Hamiltonian passivity-based control. First, a small-signal model is established to reveal the mechanism of disturbance circulation and amplification within the dual-loop control structure of the rotor-side converter (RSC). Subsequently, based on Hamiltonian system theory, an energy-based model of the VSG-DFIG is constructed, and a feedback control law under Hamiltonian control is designed. Specifically, this passivity-based control strategy provides the system with nonlinear damping characteristics adaptable to various operating conditions through energy shaping and damping injection. Furthermore, an adaptive observer is employed to optimize the feedback control law using estimated state variables. Finally, considering practical scenarios including grid oscillations, wind speed fluctuations, and the number of wind turbines, a simulation model for DFIG subsynchronous oscillations is developed and validated via MATLAB/Simulink. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional VSG-DFIG strategies in terms of oscillation suppression time, suppression rate, and system stability, offering a more robust and efficient technical pathway for high-penetration wind power integration."

However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials"

An injection path is introduced into the mutual-coupling circuit where the magnetrons are directly bridged by a coaxial line. Mutual coupling ensures phase coherence, whereas injection locking effectively stabilizes the operating frequency. Moreover, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results indicate that adjusting the coupling position between the antenna and the vane on one of the magnetrons can alter the coupling polarity at the output port, thereby enabling discrete transitions of the output phase difference between the two magnetrons between 0° and 180°. Furthermore, once the system is locked, the phase of the injection signal has a negligible impact on the relative phase difference between the output signals. This provides a new direction for addressing power combining and high-efficiency radiation in large-scale array applications."

This approach is beneficial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that require on-chip learning for real-time processing. However, implementing on-chip learning in CIM architectures remains challenging due to limited throughput and energy-efficiency during both online training and inference. In conventional architectures, weight updates necessitate the inference process to halt to avoid unintended computation outcomes. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a novel Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT)-based CIM architecture tailored for continuous on-chip learning applications, which enable weight updates without interrupting the inference. The proposed SOT bit-cell utilizes two read ports and one write port (2R1W) configuration, where one read port (1R) is dedicated to inference and one read and one write (1R1W) for on-chip learning that enables concurrent read and write operations. Our proposed architecture is evaluated at the system-level using the Generic-PDK 45 nm technology node, demonstrating 2.4× improvement in energy-efficiency and 5.4× improvement in throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions, with minimal overhead."

Considering the shielding effect, we propose a geometric distribution of the \"ring\" structure and three types of corresponding patterns. We adopt a spatial temporal range tree (STR tree) to obtain potential aggressors and use event-based sweeping lines to get the true aggressor for wire segmentation and environment search. To approximate the process effect on the conductor’s resistivity, we assume a fixed metal density to obtain the corresponding resistance per square (RPSQ) and then experiment to obtain the optimal metal density. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrate that our extractor performs better than OpenRCX and PEX on multiple metrics."

As demands for both model accuracy and privacy-preserving solutions continue to rise, on-device training is gaining traction for enabling secure, adaptive learning directly on edge devices. However, the intensive computation and complex dataflows inherent to instance segmentation models pose a major barrier to achieving real-time training in resource-constrained environments. While prior research on on-device training has focused largely on image classification, efficient hardware acceleration for instance segmentation training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present TETRIS, the first FPGA-based hardware accelerator specifically tailored for training instance segmentation models. TETRIS introduces structural and quantization-aware optimizations, including channel-aware smoothing quantization and distribution-aware tie quantization, to significantly reduce both computational and memory overhead. Moreover, TETRIS adopts a heterogeneous hardware architecture, incorporating a reconfigurable convolution processing unit (RC-PU) that supports variable kernel sizes and a fully pipelined auxiliary processing unit to handle specialized operations efficiently. Experimental evaluation on YOLACT-based instance segmentation tasks demonstrates that TETRIS achieves a peak performance of 805.9 GOPS and an energy efficiency of 69.5 GOPS/W, confirming its ability to support real-time training even in resource-constrained edge environments."

In addition, three optimization strategies are introduced, focusing on partition granularity, technology node, and wafer metal layer, which work synergistically to improve the cost efficiency of 2.5D design.

    "abstract": "In high-level synthesis (HLS), C/C++ programs with synthesis directives are used to generate circuits for FPGA implementations. However, hardware-specific and platform-dependent characteristics in circuit implementations can introduce behavioral discrepancies between the original C/C++ programs and the circuits after high-level synthesis. Existing methods for testing behavioral discrepancies in HLS are still immature, and the testing workflow requires significant human efforts. To address this challenge, we propose HLSTester, a large language model (LLM) aided testing framework that efficiently detects behavioral discrepancies in HLS. To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs and enhance prompt quality, existing C/C++ testbenches are used to guide the LLM to generate HLS-compatible versions, effectively eliminating certain traditional C/C++ syntax that are incompatible with HLS tools. Key variables are pinpointed through a backward slicing technique in both C/C++ and HLS programs to monitor their runtime spectra, enabling an in-depth analysis of the discrepancy symptoms. Then, a testing input generation mechanism is introduced to integrate dynamic mutation with insights from an LLM-based progressive reasoning chain. In addition, repetitive hardware testing is skipped by a redundancy-aware technique for the generated test inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-aided testing framework significantly accelerates the testing workflow while achieving higher testbench simulation pass rates compared with the traditional method and the direct use of LLMs on the same HLS programs."

The free and open RISC-V ISA promotes open-source ASIP solutions to accelerate diverse application domains. Existing ASIP tools generate hardware and software artifacts from high-level architecture description languages (ADLs), however, they only support the in-pipeline coupling strategy on specific processors. As a result, they suffer from two critical limitations: they restrict instruction extensions to stateless behavior, preventing hardware implementation of efficient control flow like loops, and they impose rigid microarchitectural constraints that limit register file and memory interactions. These restrictions create a fundamental bottleneck in application acceleration and prevent the efficient deployment of custom instructions across different processors.We introduce Clay, an open-source high-level ASIP framework that overcomes these limitations. Clay introduces a unified instruction extension interface that abstracts different coupling strategies as microarchitecture-agnostic actions and microarchitectural attributes. Clay ADL (CADL) combines the interface actions and high-level syntax to describe general instruction behavior, which can be stateful. We further propose a microarchitecture-aware synthesis flow that selects the best coupling strategy for each custom instruction and schedules the optimal implementation with microarchitectural attributes modeled as constraints. Our evaluation of diverse workloads demonstrates that Clay delivers substantial performance improvements across two RISC-V processors, our custom Clay-core and the open-source Rocket-core."

    "abstract": "Introduction. One of the most important systems of the human body is its defense system, on the functioning of which its survival and health depend. According to modern concepts, the human defense system has a highly complex, insufficiently well-studied structure of a dynamic type, which does not allow obtaining adequate models for assessing the level of body’s protection (LBP) with the subsequent synthesis of models for assessing the state and managing human health at a level that meets the requirements of modern medicine. Analysis of domestic and foreign literature showed that in modern medicine only private models, algorithms and recommendations have been obtained for quantitative assessment of the body’s protective capabilities from a very limited and specific set of risk factors. This makes the problem of developing new methods and means for quantitative assessment of LBP relevant. Their application will improve the quality of solving problems for forecasting, assessing the health and functional state of a person, his systems and organs. The purpose of the work is to improve the quality of forecasting and diagnostics of the state of health and functional state by using quantitative characteristics of the level of protection of the body by the antioxidant system. Materials and Methods. In the course of the conducted studies, it was found that the solution of the tasks for assessing the bodies protective functions, in addition to insufficient theoretical study, is also complicated by the fact that the indicators characterising the Protective Functions of the Body and its systems in combination with other informative indicators necessary for building adequate decision-making models are characterised by an incomplete and fuzzy structure. The studied classes of states have significant areas of intersections that are not amenable to rigourous mathematical description. In addition, concepts characterising the level of body protection, from a mathematical point of view, belong to poorly formalised categories. At this stage of the medical science development, they cannot be described by functional dependencies on indicators used in medical practice. The establishment of reliable statistical dependencies requires a large number of research with an unknown result. Experience in solving this class of problems has shown that good results in the quality of decisions can be achieved using the methodology for synthesizing hybrid fuzzy decision rules (MSHFDR) developed at the SouthWest State University. Within the framework of the selected methodology, a quantitative assessment of LBP is specified by a scale on the interval [0,…, 1]. The zero value corresponds to the breakdown of the protective functions, leading to death without external assistance aimed at correcting this function. The unit value corresponds to such a state of the protective function that allows maintaining the performance in the studied structure of the organism with the required quality. Results. The study of the antioxidant defense system working mechanism shows that the highest level of protective system properties corresponds to the presence of a dynamic balance between the quantitative characteristics of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant activity (AOA). In practical measurements, LPO is determined through its end product malondialdehyde (MDA). Using these indicators, a fuzzy model of LBP by the antioxidant system, which is an integral part of medical expert systems, was obtained in the work. The practical effectiveness by the obtained model was tested on the problems of predicting recurrence of myocardial infarction and complications after kidney injury, as well as on the problem of assessing the severity body’s endogenous intoxication and pyelonephritis after nephrolithotripsy. During the statistical tests conducted, it was shown that the use of the LBP indicator in the composition of decision rules from the antioxidant system increases the quality of decisions made by 10-15% Conclusion. The obtained results are recommended for use in medical expert systems, providing improved quality of forecasting, early and differential diagnostics of various classes of diseases."

High speed of angiography image processing allows not only to reduce the time of the study, but also to make a decision to perform therapeutic operations during the diagnostic procedure. The purpose of the work is to develop new methods of automated processing of angiographic images to increase the speed of occlusion localization in conditions of high noise in the image. The technology of double scanning with calculation of the amplitudes of the selected Walsh frequencies of the subwindow inside the main window is proposed for automated systems for processing radiocontrast angiographic images. Preliminary studies of this process have been carried out. Noise immunity and high speed of this approach are shown for searching for characteristic points on the radiocontrast image. The frequencies are highlighted on the spectral two-dimensional Walsh plane. Analysis of the amplitudes of these frequencies allows detecting the edges of the vessels on the angiographic image. The calculated coordinates of the vessel contour are used to estimate the vessel diameter in the local scanning window. An array of calculated vessel diameters allows for automatic detection of occlusions. Examples of testing the proposed method are provided both on model images and on real medical images. Analysis of the test results of the proposed method showed high computational efficiency and the possibility of implementing the proposed algorithm even on processors without hardware multiplication and division commands."

Comprehensive morphological and functional indicators, including angular and linear parameters, are calculated automatically, enhancing diagnostic reliability and reproducibility. Validation on a dataset of 2,000 images revealed exceptional accuracy in anatomical keypoint detection ($99.15 \\%$), with deviations in angular measurements consistently below 5 degrees. The implementation of automated diagnostic reporting further minimizes human error and enhances clinical decisionmaking.

    "abstract": "This study presents a comparative analysis of two approaches for the automatic diagnosis of osteoporosis from lumbar spine radiographs: a purely neural network method and a hybrid approach combining deep learning with texture feature analysis. The relevance of this research is due to the growing prevalence of osteoporosis, which affects one in three women and one in four men over the age of 50, and the need to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce subjectivity in clinical decision-making. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches by analyzing their segmentation and classification performance. The neural network method relies on deep learning architectures such as DeepLabV3+ for segmentation and Res-Net-34 for classification, while the hybrid method integrates traditional texture feature extraction (GLCM, LBP, and wavelet transforms) with the Random Forest classifier. The results demonstrate that the neural network approach achieves an accuracy of $87.42 \\%$, while the hybrid method, despite a lower overall accuracy of $78 \\%$, provides higher recall ($86 \\%$) for positive osteoporosis cases, minimizing false negatives. These findings indicate that deep learning offers high precision, whereas hybrid models provide better interpretability and sensitivity. The proposed approaches contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of osteoporosis detection in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to propose a method for bio-impedance based system, which can provide real time monitoring of arterial stiffness. Study was conducted using local bio-impedance measurement by surface-attached electrode system was used to provide real time and continuous assessment of arterial stiffness. Thus, the inDU-loop technique necessitates concurrent evaluation of both the diameter waveform and blood flow velocity profiles in superficial arteries. The arterial diameter waveform was assessed by inverse solution of bio-impedance forward problem. Therefore, the ECG gated blood flow velocity and bio-impedance signal obtained from single point were used to plot their relationship to assess the local PWV hence the corresponding arterial stiffness. Results: The presented algorithm has shown its ability to detect arterial dimensions and local pulse wave velocity on a beat-to-beat basis simultaneously. Its potential for estimating arterial stiffness was validated in four test subjects. Conclusion: assessment of arterial stiffness is important for understanding the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Conducting this assessment non-invasively and on a long-term basis provides significant advantages for diagnosis."

It controls the motion of the robot through the feedback from the vision sensors assembled at the end-effector of the robot, so that the feature points of the object are imaged at specific pixel points. Considering camera assembly error, end-effector assembly error, and vibration-induced noise during robot operation may affect vision servo control. We propose a model-free IBVS control scheme, which introduces a data-driven learning strategy to achieve the learning of the robot and camera Jacobian matrices and precise control of robots with unknown structures. Meanwhile, a neural dynamics-based noise-tolerant solver is proposed to solve the problems caused by noises during the robot's operation on visual servocontrol, and related theoretical analyses are carried out. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulations and experiments. Its superiority is demonstrated by comparison with other IBVS schemes."

Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets of grayscale images and color images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN.

Existing solutions predominantly rely on rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches, the SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling-based deployment method, eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance. The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional robotic dressing assistance."

    "abstract": "Robots executing iterative tasks in complex, uncertain environments require control strategies that balance robustness, safety, and high performance. This paper introduces a safe information-theoretic learning model predictive control (SIT-LMPC) algorithm for iterative tasks. Specifically, we design an iterative control framework based on an information-theoretic model predictive control algorithm to address a constrained infinite-horizon optimal control problem for discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems. An adaptive penalty method is developed to ensure safety while balancing optimality. Trajectories from previous iterations are utilized to learn a value function using normalizing flows, which enables richer uncertainty modeling compared to Gaussian priors. SIT-LMPC is designed for highly parallel execution on graphics processing units, allowing efficient real-time optimization. Benchmark simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that SIT-LMPC iteratively improves system performance while robustly satisfying system constraints."

In this letter, we propose a novel Lyapunov-based CBF framework. It offers the following key advantages: (1) Using a single Control Lyapunov Function (CLF), this method synthesizes spatially shifted CBFs to construct an expansive safe invariant set in obstacle-dense environments. (2) The framework is capable of incorporating existing approaches for constructing quadratic CLF, making it applicable to a wide range of complex nonlinear systems and enhancing its generality and extensibility. (3) It enables real-time synthesis of CBFs, and ensures safety in large-scale 3D environments through efficient CBF-based quadratic programming (CBF-QP). (4) The method ensures safety while inheriting the stability properties of the CLF, allowing the asymptotic convergence of the system state to equilibrium, thus unifying safety and motion stability. To validate efficacy, we rigorously tested the framework in both simulations and hardware experiments."

    "abstract": "Owing to the resilience in structure and adaptability to the environment, tensegrity robots have a variety of potential applications in environmental exploration, search and rescue, and other fields. However, the interaction with the environment could be unpredictable, which requires the robots to be equipped with the ability of environment perception. This article presents a junction tensegrity robot (JTBot), which consists of both flexible and rigid struts, for the inspection of unstructured pipelines. Slender elastic beams are utilized to replace the rigid rods to enhance the robot’s dexterity and flexibility by generating large-scale deformations. Compact deflection sensors are embedded onto the flexible struts to enable the JTBot with the capability to estimate its equilibrium state and to predict the contact conditions with the environment. A closed-form model of the robot’s kinetostatics is established to characterize the interaction behavior of such a cable-constrained flexible mechanism efficiently. Hence, in situ gait optimization can be implemented for the crawling robot with the aid of the intrinsic environmental perception. A prototype of the JTBot is developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design, on which a variety of validation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the developed JTBot is able to pass through complex pipelines in a dexterous way. In addition, a demonstration is provided to illustrate the JTBot’s capability of defect detection in unstructured pipelines."

This paper presents a new interactive scene synthesis method that alleviates the designer from interacting with the 3D scene and its objects. Designers only need to select an object group in an independent panel through coarse clustering and fine clustering. Then, the furniture objects will be automatically added to the scene. This paper proposes a two-level clustering that applies the Affinity Propagation Algorithm (APA) to groups of furniture objects such that the object groups can even be clustered without linear representations, latent encoding, etc. To fully apply the APA, we also propose quantitatively measuring how different the two layouts are, i.e., how quantitatively the arrangements of two object groups differ. Experiments first show that our method is more user-friendly and interactively efficient than other interactive synthesis methods. By comparing our method with recent automatic scene synthesis methods, we demonstrate that our methods still have competitive plausibility. We also verify that our method does not harm the diversity and generalization of 3D scenes."

Visualizing the motion of 3D anatomical structures, such as organs and tumors, is critical for computer-aided interventions. However, conventional 4D volumetric reconstruction methods typically produce a limited set of volumes at discrete phases, suffering from low temporal resolution. Moreover, it often requires extensive segmentation of 3D structures or regions for visualizing volumetric data, making it challenging to segment and visualize dynamic volumes in real-time. To address these challenges, VolMoVis framework employs a continuous implicit neural representation that decomposes the dynamic volumetric data into a static reference volume and a continuous deformation field. This decomposition, along with an efficient deformation network, enables our framework to achieve real-time volume generation and volumetric visualization of continuous anatomical motions. We evaluate VolMoVis on both 4D digital phantoms and real patient datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate anatomical reconstruction and motion tracking. Furthermore, we highlight its capabilities in real-time simultaneous volume generation and tumor segmentation for visualizing dynamic volumes and 4D tumor tracking, showcasing its potential in image-guided radiation therapy"

    "abstract": "In this work, we challenge the dominant use of logarithmic scales to communicate values spanning multiple orders of magnitude—Orders of Magnitude Values (OMVs)—to the general public. Focusing on bar charts, we incorporate cognitive insights into visualization design to better align with how humans perceive OMVs. Studies in cognitive psychology suggest that, for large numerical ranges such as millions and billions, people do not think logarithmically. Instead, they perceive numbers in a piecewise linear manner, grouping values into scale words (e.g., millions) and applying linear reasoning within each group. We build upon a recently introduced piecewise linear scale, EplusM, and validate its use in bar charts, which we refer to as EplusM bar charts. We also introduce two novel variants of the EplusM bar chart informed by findings in numerical perception: Bricks, which builds on the concepts of round numbers and subitizing, and Multi-Magnitude, which leverages categorical perception of large numbers. In a crowdsourced experiment, we evaluate four bar chart designs: 1) Log, 2) EplusM, 3) Bricks, and 4) Multi-Magnitude, across value retrieval and quantitative comparison tasks. Our results show that EplusM bar charts are significantly preferred over logarithmic designs, increase user confidence, and reduce perceived mental demand, while maintaining task performance. These findings suggest that EplusM bar charts can serve as effective alternatives to logarithmic ones when visualizing OMVs for general audiences."

    "abstract": "Human emotion recognition (HER) is crucial for emotional-state interpretation through cues such as facial expressions, speech, gestures, and physiological signals. However, existing HER systems are primarily based on controlled indoor settings, limiting their applicability in harsh outdoor environments. The limitation necessitates the development of noninvasive HER solutions for improving outdoor worker safety, performance, and well-being. This study proposes a hybrid learning (HL) framework integrated with a Radio Frequency Sensing (RFS)-based Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform for noninvasive HER in harsh outdoor environments. A custom RFS-SDR dataset was collected from five participants, each performing ten experiments with eight distinct emotional states, to evaluate the robustness of the proposed framework. The methodology combines machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid learning (HL) approaches to analyze time-series RFS signals. Statistical and spectral features were extracted from the RFS data, while DL models such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU were used to capture temporal dependencies in emotional patterns. The HL model leverage both handcrafted and learned features for improved classification accuracy. Comprehensive models evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation was also verified for ensuring subject-independent generalization. The results demonstrate that HL models consistently outperform standalone ML and DL classifiers, achieving up to 98% accuracy across eight emotion classes. These findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach to demonstrate the potential for real-time emotion monitoring in outdoor environments."

    "abstract": "Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors are key components in precision optical systems, enabling miniature, low-inertia scanning and accurate beam steering solutions. They offer high operating frequencies in the kHz range and angular resolutions below the millidegree. While many studies have addressed the improvement of MEMS tempral and angular response, calibration, and integration into larger systems such as LiDAR, there is still a lack of detailed calibration methods that accurately describe MEMS behavior in their operating environment. This paper addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured calibration methodology. The proposed approaches based on a video calibration in which we analyse the positioning of the camera and the selection of the calibration plane. These two parameters have a significant influence on the accuracy and repeatability of the system. Analytical calculations are provided to determine the three-dimensional position and orientation of the MEMS mirror within a reference frame. The repeatability of the camera-based measurement system is evaluated. A comparative study is also conducted between two methods for estimating the laser line direction, using either two or five points per line. The results show that using five points improves the accuracy of the MEMS mirror pose estimation. The second part of the method focuses on evaluating the electrical response curve of the MEMS device. The effect of the perpendicularity between the mirror and the calibration plane is examined, and the principle of the method is explained in detail. A surface fitting approach is introduced to model the response behavior of the MEMS mirror more accurately across its entire operational range, resulting in a more precise and reliable characterization. This complete calibration process provides robust and accurate system characteristics that are essential for high-precision optical applications."

Traditional machine learning methods are usually used for single-point forecasting, which has a large error when the market demand fluctuates a lot and cannot show all possible scenarios and their probability of occurrence at the forecast moment. Based on the above, t this paper proposes a model to predict the distribution of sales volume by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) and Bayesian network, which offers full picture of future sales, thus enabling the efficient decision making. The experimental results show that the model can better predict the probability distribution of merchandise sales in a certain period in the future and obtain more comprehensive merchandise sales information, which is practical for risk assessment and decision reliability of retail sales decisions."

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of information and computational workloads has created unprecedented demands for high-productivity development of computer hardware built on foundational semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs). Yet, the lack of effective design automation techniques makes developing analog ICs–indispensable in ubiquitous computer systems–a significant bottleneck for overall design productivity and cost efficiency across the IC ecosystem. Excitingly, recent advances in generative AI present transformative opportunities to tackle the complexity and large-scale challenges of modern analog/radio-frequency (RF) IC design. This work introduces a first-of-its-kind multi-agent generative synthesis framework for analog/RF circuits. Specifically, our approach formulates analog synthesis as a multi-stage generative AI problem: first generating a novel topology conditioned on high-level textual descriptions, and then producing high-quality device parameters to meet given design specifications for the generated circuit topology. This novel paradigm offers distinct advantages over traditional methods, including controllable novelty in topology generation and significantly improved inverse design efficiency. Beyond topology generation and inverse design, our method enables broader applications such as synthetic dataset generation and privacy-preserving data sharing–emerging challenges in data-driven electronic design automation (EDA) due to the computationally intensive and confidential nature of analog/RF circuit design. This work paves the way for next-generation generative AI-driven multi-agent synthesis in analog/RF EDA."

    "abstract": "In the post-Moore era, 3D ICs offer superior timing performance and lower power compared to traditional 2D designs. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) flows suffer from excessive snaking along critical paths and require many bond pads. This not only complicates production, but also degrades timing, as each inter-die connection demands a bond pad and 2× BEOL wires. The challenge arises from relying on bin-based FM partitioning, which overlooks inter-bin connections and scales poorly. We introduce Snake-3D, a snaking and timing-aware gradient-based partitioner. It eliminates excessive snaking and concurrently reduces bond pad usage during the partitioning stage, the earliest point these optimizations can be applied. Leveraging GPU acceleration and PyTorch, Snake-3D matches the cutsize quality of advanced gradient methods while running faster on modest hardware. Its integrated snaking- and timing-aware cost, combined with local density control, significantly reduces critical path snaking and achieves superior final PPA compared to GNN-based methods and the default method in SOTA 3D IC flows. On six benchmarks at 7 nm and 28 nm technology nodes, Snake-3D outperforms the default method in SOTA 3D IC flows. It reduces final bond pad by 29%, lowers average and maximum snaking by 34% and 20%, and improves WNS and TNS by 17% and 42%. Compared to GNN-based methods, Snake-3D achieves a 47% reduction in bond pads, reduces snaking by 39% (average) and 30% (maximum), and improves WNS and TNS by 48% and 62%. Snake-3D runs 7.4× faster than GNN-based and similar speed to the default method in SOTA 3D IC flows."

    "abstract": "In high-performance computing (HPC), many research has been conducted on how to efficiently utilize the idle time of HPC resources (periods when no jobs are submitted to the platform). One promising approach is to exploit this idle time by injecting small, flexible, independent, and interruptible jobs that have no strict time constraints. However, managing the injection of these jobs is challenging due to the stochastic nature of job parameters, such as execution times and resource consumption. Additionally, process noise—resulting from system complexity and the arrival and execution of varying external workloads—can interrupt or terminate these filler jobs. In this paper, we propose and evaluate, using real data, a Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) approach that addresses system uncertainty and incorporates a feed-forward compensation mechanism for disturbance rejection. The proposed algorithm shows promising results: it ensures a platform usage rate of 98%, significantly improving overall resource efficiency and reducing the number of early terminated jobs compared to previous work."

Recent studies have shown that free (extracellular) dietary nucleotides present in specific foods, such as fish, seafood, and meat, may affect tumor growth by accelerating its development. From this perspective, assessing the nucleotide content in these food products could be valuable for developing more effective treatment strategies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using the ATP bioluminescence and Fast Protein and Metabolite Liquid Chromatography (FPMLC) optical techniques to analyze relative variations in the levels of free ATP and other dietary purine nucleotides-ADP, AMP, IMP, inosine, and hypoxanthine-in the muscle tissue of meat and fish during cold storage in raw form and after thermal processing. A custom designed compact optoelectronic FPMLC chemical sensor and conventional ATP luminometer were used to track changes in free dietary nucleotides content in various raw and thermally processed meat and fish products. It was revealed that ordinary household heat treatment and high-pressure homogenization involved in the industrial preparation of highly processed foods can have a huge impact on free nucleotides, especially relatively unstable ATP, in ready-to-eat food. This study demonstrated the capability of ATP bioluminescence and FPMLC as rapid analytical techniques for the analyzing of the nucleotide composition of thermal processed fish and meat products as well as an assessment of the potential risks associated with consuming these foods by patients with malignant tumors."

This study investigates the application of Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) for classifying PD based on accelerometer data.The primary goal of this research is to develop a robust classification model capable of accurately distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls using accelerometer readings collected during various activities. Statistical and frequency domain features, including measures of central tendency, variability, and spectral characteristics, are extracted from the data. A GBM model is then trained to identify movement patterns indicative of PD.Accurate classification of PD patients can facilitate timely interventions, personalized treatment, and improved patient care.

We present a rigorously analytical, end-toend framework that predicts every stage of the imaging chainfrom probe steering to ridge segmentation-without relying on empirical calibration. The framework introduces four innovations. First, closed-form, angle-resolved Fresnel expressions prescribe a constrained steering window that maximizes cortical visibility while avoiding total reflection. Second, a single probability density function unifies Rayleigh, K-distributed diffuse, and coherent specular scattering, enabling parameter-free speckle synthesis. Third, a covarianceweighted, multi-frame estimator embeds local radio-frequency gradients in a regularized least-squares formulation, yielding analytic drift bounds for displacement tracking. Fourth, gradient-based, phase-symmetry, and convolutional ridge detectors are benchmarked under ordinary theoretical error bounds, allowing their deployment to be matched to specific signal conditions. Together, these elements delineate a reproducible design space for simulation and lay a theoretical foundation for radiation-free monitoring of cortical biomechanics."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an advanced adaptive Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework designed to address the leader-follower tracking problem in multi-vehicle systems operating under highly dynamic and uncertain environmental conditions. A key challenge in such scenarios is the presence of partially unknown leader dynamics, which often impedes accurate trajectory prediction and, consequently, effective follower control. To overcome this, the proposed approach integrates a real-time Auto-Regressive (AR) modeling technique for identifying and predicting the leader’s future states within the NMPC prediction horizon. This enables the follower vehicle to anticipate the leader’s motion and compute control actions that minimize tracking errors while adhering to physical and actuation constraints. An innovative feature of the framework is its adaptive weighting mechanism within the NMPC cost function. Unlike traditional fixed-weight MPC formulations, this mechanism dynamically adjusts the prioritization of error components in real time, based on the magnitude and significance of deviations in position, orientation, and velocity. This adaptive prioritization enhances the system’s ability to respond robustly to external disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, and sudden trajectory changes of the leader, ensuring resilient and smooth follower behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is rigorously validated through simulations employing a Kinematic Bicycle Model of the vehicles. These simulations demonstrate significant improvements in tracking accuracy, responsiveness to environmental uncertainties, and robustness against modeling inaccuracies."

    "abstract": "E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However, traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities, guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis fields, e-boost demonstrates 558× runtime speedup over traditional exact approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art extraction framework (SmoothE).

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to solve previously intractable problems, with neutral atoms emerging as a promising technology. Zoned neutral atom architectures allow for immense parallelism and higher coherence times by shielding idling atoms from interference with laser beams. However, in addition to hardware, successful quantum computation requires sophisticated software support, particularly compilers that optimize quantum algorithms for hardware execution. In the compilation flow for zoned neutral atom architectures, the effective interplay of the placement and routing stages decides the overhead caused by rearranging the atoms during the quantum computation. Suboptimal placements can lead to unnecessary serialization of the rearrangements in the subsequent routing stage. Despite this, all existing compilers treat placement and routing independently thus far—focusing solely on minimizing travel distances. This work introduces the first routing-aware placement method to address this shortcoming. It groups compatible movements into parallel rearrangement steps to minimize both rearrangement steps and travel distances. The implementation utilizing the A* algorithm reduces the rearrangement time by 17% on average and by 49% in the best case compared to the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "The paper focuses on the design of a control system for a class of grippers with continuum arms. The associated mathematical models for continuum arms are analyzed, insisting on the influence of dead times on driving performance. The model of the force exerted on the contact surface of the load is studied. The grasping function is obtained by coiling the terminal element around the load and exerting a corresponding pressure force on the load surface. The effects generated by dead times are discussed. The Lambert functions are introduced for the dead time analyze and Lyapunov techniques are used for the system stability investigation. The theoretical results are verified by numerical simulation."

This model integrates physical relationships into neural network (NN) models to enhance accuracy, data fitting flexibility, and circuit-simulation speed, while providing physical explanations for NN-based compact models. It addresses several limitations of previous NN models, such as guaranteeing zero current at zero bias, variability, and fitting flexibility, by incorporating physics. We demonstrate that this model can be applied to a wide range of geometries and temperatures with excellent accuracy. The developed quasi-physical function enables the model to provide post-training fitting flexibility and model process variations."

    "abstract": "The health condition and remaining useful life prediction of lithium-ion batteries are of vital importance to the safety of energy supply systems. Nonetheless, existing methods for health status and remaining useful life prediction fail to effectively reveal the correlation among features during the charging and discharging process. Moreover, they neglect the temporal relationship of features themselves. Besides, there are obvious limitations in current temporal network methods for predicting the degradation process of different instances, as they are not adequate in capturing long-term dependency relationships. To address these issues, this study introduces a two-stage MINE-Graph-Mamba (MGM) method. In the first instance, the MINE is employed to extract the correlation among features, to serve as edge information of the graph. These relationships are then processed through a graph attention mechanism, while merging new correlation information, and feeding this combination into the Mamba to extract temporal relations and to generate feature representations. The first stage models the multidimensional time-series features of each charge-discharge cycle, producing a unified charge-discharge feature representation. In the second stage, these representations are input into the MGM model to obtain multi-level feature evolution representations that describe the entire degradation process, enabling accurate life prediction. Experimental validation using real battery data demonstrates that the proposed method significantly improves health status and RUL predictions, outperforming existing data-driven approaches."

    "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization aims to retrieve images of the same location captured from different viewpoints. Recent deep learning methods have improved this task. However, most rely on full model fine-tuning, which demands large memory and storage due to extensive parameters. To address this limitation, we propose AdaptGeo, a parameter-efficient framework that adapts frozen vision foundation model through lightweight transformer-based adapter. The adapter employs multi-head attention to learn viewpoint-invariant representations, effectively bridging the domain gap between drone and satellite imagery. The framework is further enhanced by a multi-objective learning strategy that integrates contrastive learning with location-specific supervision. A frozen backbone also allows feature pre-extraction, reducing training and inference cost. Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate competitive performance. Compared to traditional full model fine-tuning approaches, our method reduces trainable parameters by over 87%. The proposed approach provides an efficient solution for adapting visual foundation models to cross-view geo-localization."

    "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (VRL) aims to learn optimal policies directly from pixel data, which holds significant potential for applications in control systems characterized by data scarcity and complex environment. However, the representation learning capability of agent is significantly hindered by high-dimensional inputs, leading to suboptimal training efficiency and poor generalization in current visual reinforcement learning methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a visual reinforcement learning with multi-objective representation alignment (MORA) comprising: (i) a hierarchical representation fusion module fusing multi-scale visual features, and (ii) a complementary representation alignment module harmonizing three self-supervised objectives: unidirectional prediction objective (UPO), representation consistency objective (RCO), and reconstruction alignment objective (RAO). This synergy stabilizes latent space topology while unifying task-relevant features, effectively mitigating representational collapse. Extensive experiments on DMControl demonstrate that MORA outperforms state-of-the-art VRL methods in sample efficiency and generalization for continuous control tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies validate individual contributions of each component and underscore the criticality of multi-objective synergistic optimization."

    "abstract": "AC-AC converters are widely used in various industrial applications. However, for transformerless back-to-back cascaded H-bridge (BTB-CHB) converters, although the traditional methods can avoid the capacitor short-circuit (CSC) faultsthe use of complex truth tables for switching state selection results in heavy iterative computation, while also contributing to poor current harmonic quality. To address this issue, this paper takes a two-module structure as an example, thoroughly analyzes the formation mechanism of CSC faults, and summarizes the corresponding fault criterion formula. On this basis, combined with the redundancy characteristics of space vectors, a space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) strategy that can effectively avoid CSC faults is proposed. This strategy not only significantly reduces current harmonic distortion, but also eliminates the need for complex truth table lookup methods, simplifies the iterative computation process, and greatly alleviates the computational burden on the processor. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are verified through simulation and experimental results."

Traditional ways of reducing fear, such as the \"tell-show-do\" method, have proven effective, but they sometimes lack engagement and involvement for younger patients. With the increased accessibility of smartphones and augmented reality (AR), new digital approaches are emerging to address this issue in new ways. This paper introduces Tooth Quests, an Android-based mobile application created with the Unity game engine and AR Foundation tool. The application is designed to reduce dental anxiety in children by using gamified learning and immersive mini-games that simulate common dental experiences. It integrates storytelling, visual feedback, and educational content based on pediatric behavioural approaches. A user survey conducted among doctors, parents and children supports the application's relevance and utility, demonstrating that interactive technologies can improve children's perceptions of dental care. The study suggests that digital solutions such as Tooth Quests provide an appealing option for anxiety reduction and oral health education in pediatric dentistry."

    "abstract": "Cross-Site Scripting remains a prevalent vulnerability in modern web applications, despite the widespread adoption of output encoding libraries, hardened browser environments, and policy-driven security mechanisms such as Content Security Policy. A core challenge lies in the ever-expanding and rapidly evolving nature of the attack surface. As HTML parsing rules and JavaScript semantics continue to evolve, new contexts emerge where malicious scripts can be injected and executed. Simultaneously, attackers continually refine their filter-evasion techniques, further complicating defense efforts. Security testing workflows commonly rely on static payload collections of known attack strings curated over time. While these datasets are crucial, they often fail to keep pace with emerging attack strategies, potentially overlooking novel or subtle injection vectors. This paper highlights the resulting gap in evaluation coverage and explores the potential of automatically generated payloads as a forward-looking research avenue. In particular, we present early-stage experiments in synthesizing such payloads and discuss their dual role: not only can they help identify vulnerabilities introduced by previously unseen attack patterns, but they can also serve to augment training datasets for machine learning-based detection systems, where real-world exploit data is often limited."

Simulation data from the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) were used to evaluate three feature-selection methods—SHAP, Boruta, and recursive feature elimination (RFE)—to identify the most informative input variables. Concurrently, three normalization schemes (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, and RobustScaler) were assessed for their impact on model accuracy. Each GRU network was trained and tested on datasets preprocessed according to every combination of feature-selection and normalization method. Model robustness was further evaluated under controlled input-noise conditions. Under nominal conditions, the best performance was achieved by pairing StandardScaler normalization with RFE-selected features, yielding the lowest prediction error. Under noisy inputs, models trained with RobustScaler demonstrated superior resilience to perturbations. Finally, the top-performing GRU models were integrated into a MATLAB Simulink environment for practical validation. The results underscore the critical influence of preprocessing choices on soft-sensor accuracy and robustness and confirm the feasibility of GRU networks for reliable DO estimation in wastewater treatment applications."

    "abstract": "Endonasal surgery of brain tumors is associated with the risk of cranial nerve and blood vessel damage, leading to reduced quality of life or death. Effective local subsurface detection of neurovascular structures is therefore crucial but remains a challenge due to the limitations of conventional intraoperative techniques such as Doppler ultrasound and electrophysiological techniques, particularly in narrow surgical fields. This study aims to enhance a novel solution for intraoperative identification of subsurface neurovascular inclusions based on frequency domain near infrared spectroscopy combined with machine learning. The key objective is to adapt the detection algorithm to the individual optical properties of each patient’s tissues. The tasks included dataset collection, designing a reference classifier and its adaptation for unseen optical properties. Given the complexity and time required to collect real intraoperative data, synthetic training data were generated using the finite element method. A metric-based few-shot learning method, employing prototypical networks with Mahalanobis distance, was chosen for reference algorithm adaptation. Analysis of results demonstrated that the reference classifier, while accurate on familiar data (recall was 0.88), failed on unseen data. In contrast, the trained prototypical network significantly improved classification performance on unknown optical properties, achieving high precision and recall for inclusions of 1 mm in diameter and greater. Although classification of smaller inclusions (0.5 mm) remains uncertain, but detection was still possible. The results support the feasibility of using few-shot learning with frequency domain near infrared spectroscopy for real-time, intraoperative detection of neurovascular structures, offering a promising alternative to existing methods."

We need to develop an accurate experimental model to properly reproduce simulation conditions in bench tests. This study presents a technology for creating brain vessel phantom models with aneurysms based on patient-specific data. Various phantom fabrication approaches were tested, ranging from simplified geometries to models replicating actual vessel anatomy. We present a comprehensive methodology for fabricating patient-specific cerebral aneurysm silicone phantoms derived from clinical imaging data. The phantoms were used for both computational modeling and bench testing. The experimental setup enabled simulation of both steady and pulsatile flow conditions, replicating physiological blood flow. The results demonstrated the capability to visualize complex flow patterns in cerebral vessels with aneurysms using the phantom.

Our approach is based on static analysis, and the tool can detect different versions of smart contract code. We used regex to identify external calls in the contract and Control Flow Graph (CFG) to identify the components of the code. A detection algorithm was developed to identify reentrancy vulnerabilities. This approach enhances contract reliability and reduces risk prior to deployment. Our method has been evaluated using True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) metrics. We tested it on the SmartBugs benchmark suite and contracts from Etherscan. The contracts analyzed include two solidity versions: 0.4.x and 0.8.x. Thanks to the integration of multiple tools, our solution supports testing across different solidity versions."

    "abstract": "With the worsening of air pollution, the variety of airborne pollutants has significantly increased. Accurate monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere requires sensors with enhanced precision. If suspended particles in the airflow can be pre-sorted using microfluidic chips, the performance of most existing microfluidic PM detection systems could be significantly improved. In this study, a T-type optofluidic chip (TOPC) for particle sorting and collection was theoretically designed based on optical principles, and an analytical solution for the particle offset distance within the TOPC was derived. Building upon this, a dimensionless parameter S was introduced by incorporating characteristic parameters of the microfluidic chip to describe particle motion within the TOPC. Particle trajectories under varying conditions were calculated using numerical simulations and compared with theoretical predictions to validate the model. In parallel, an experimental platform was constructed. The results demonstrated that the particle offset errors were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.2\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m when compared with the theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, respectively. Furthermore, the particle sorting efficiency obtained from experiments showed strong agreement with the simulation results, confirming that the dimensionless parameter S effectively characterizes particle behavior in the TOPC. The innovation of this work lies in the novel introduction of the dimensionless parameter S and its experimental and numerical validation, providing a robust framework for optimizing TOPC design and enhancing PM sorting precision."

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) has emerged as a promising lightweight machine learning approach suitable for edge and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications due to its inherent energy efficiency and robustness in noisy environments. Despite these advantages, recent research has shown that FPGA-based HDC accelerators are susceptible to model inversion and physical attacks. In this paper, we propose a specialized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based side-channel analysis (SCA) designed to extract stored hypervector bits from FPGA-implemented HDC models. After identifying the location of CNN-extracted leakages, we introduce an adaptive Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)-guided approach to achieve much more effective attack results. This adaptive technique iteratively highlights critical leakage regions, enabling a targeted and efficient improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), accelerating the attack by rapidly narrowing down essential leakage intervals. Using approximately one million power traces obtained from a dedicated ChipWhisperer Pro measurement setup during HDC inference, our adaptive CNN-based method achieves a bit extraction accuracy of up to 93%, reaching nearly 2× the accuracy of the non-adaptive baseline with half as many traces, and ultimately providing 1.7× higher maximum bit extraction accuracy. We further analyze the robustness of the identified leakages across multiple FPGA architectures under different noise conditions. To counteract these vulnerabilities, we introduce a dynamic masking scheme that effectively reduces CNN bit extraction accuracy to ≈ 18%, with minimal overhead on FPGA resources (around 1.6× increase in LUT usage and 1.4× increase in latency). Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our protection scheme through a higher order test vector leakage assessment (TVLA), confirming a significantly reduced leakage with a t-value of ≈ 2.2."

    "abstract": "Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is known for highly parallel pattern matching capability, which is widely used for data-centric applications and advanced machine learning models that involve associative search tasks. However, most state-of-the-art CAM designs focus on binary/multi-bit CAMs (B/MCAMs) based on CMOS or emerging nonvolatile memories (NVMs), which struggle in scenarios where analog values, rather than discrete levels, need to be stored and searched. Therefore, analog CAMs (ACAMs) offer a promising solution to further increase memory density, improve energy efficiency and extend practical scenarios. Among NVMs, ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) have emerged as a strong candidate for efficient CAM designs due to the three-terminal structure, high on-off ratio, high OFF resistance and voltage-driven write/read mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FACAM, a compact and energy efficient single-input 2FeFET-1T ACAM cell design, with a two-phase search scheme, that sets the location and width of the matching range through two FeFETs, respectively. We further present a FACAM array which reduces the matchline (ML) voltage swing by shifting ML precharging into the in-cell search operations. We also propose an adaptive scheme to selectively early-terminate second search phase for further search energy optimization. Evaluation results suggest that our proposed FACAM achieves 8.39× and 2.94× energy efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art better 6T-2R ACAM and 2FeFET ACAM. Benchmarking results in deep random forest accelerator show that our approach is 2.14× faster and 7.82× energy efficient than 2FeFET ACAM."

In this paper, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to simultaneously achieve the construction of Steiner trees and buffer insertion, where the key idea is employing an appropriately designed harmonic function in the optimization. We also conduct a set of experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in depth."

ASIPs are often derived from off-the-shelf GPPs extended by custom instructions tailored towards a specific software workload. One of the most important challenges of designing an ASIP is to find said custom instructions that help to increase performance without being too costly in terms of area and power consumption. To date, solving this challenge is relatively labor-intensive and typically performed manually.Addressing the lack of automation, we present Custom Instruction Designer for RISC-V Extensions (CIDRE), a front-to-back tool for ASIP design. CIDRE automatically analyzes hot spots in RISC-V applications and generates custom instruction suggestions with a corresponding nML description. The nML description can be used with other electronic design automation tools to accurately assess the cost and benefits of the found suggestions. In a RISC-V benchmark study, we were able to accelerate embedded benchmarks from Embench and MiBench by up to 2.47x with less than 24% area increase.

Existing post-training pruning methods primarily measure weight importance in converged dense models, often overlooking changes in weight significance during the pruning process, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, facilitating global performance optimization. We are the first to employ the product of weights and gradients as a pruning metric in the context of LLM post-training pruning. This enables accurate identification of weight importance in massive models and significantly reduces computational complexity compared to methods using second-order information. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber efficiently prunes models from LLaMA and OPT families (7B to 13B) on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks."

However, numerous iterations are inevitable due to design changes in components of a product such as different placement on PCBs. Traditional approaches to S-parameter extraction rely on computationally expensive electromagnetic simulations, becoming a bottleneck in the design process. To tackle this issue, we present PCBFormer, a novel deep learning framework that predicts S-parameters of PCBs with high accuracy and efficiency. Our framework effectively captures multiple traces’ electromagnetic interactions across multiple layers in 3D PCB structure, taking each layer’s properties into account. For realistic PCB examples with 10 traces and 25 layers, PCBFormer achieves 0.86 R2 score across 210 S-parameters and DC to 1GHz frequency range."

    "abstract": "Signum Coded Synthetic Aperture Radar (SC-SAR), also known as the one-bit SAR, significantly reduces the system complexity and data processing throughput by retaining only the sign information of the echo signal. However, this introduces severe quantization distortion, which degrades the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and generates a succession of false targets in sparse scenes. The theoretical analysis reveals that the SNR degradation is primarily caused by the phase harmonic distortion, while the false targets are brought about by the amplitude intermodulation distortion. To address these issues, a nonlinear frequency-modulated (NLFM) signal with a Hamming-windowed amplitude spectrum, termed Hamming Frequency Modulation (HFM), is proposed as the transmitted waveform. The matched filter for the HFM signal integrates the pulse compression and the low-sidelobe weighting, optimizing the output peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) to suppress the quantization noise. Concurrently, its nonlinear frequency modulation disrupts the periodicity of the intermodulation distortion, attenuating the peak power of false targets. Experiments utilizing both ideal point targets and real SAR raw data demonstrate that the proposed HFM method suppresses the quantization noise and the false target energy by approximately 0.8 dB and 4.8 dB, respectively, compared to the conventional Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) signal, thereby enhancing SC-SAR image quality significantly."

The agents track a reference trajectory in the expected configuration and perform scaling maneuver to optimize a time-varying global cost function. For online calculation of the formation scale that is optimal to the cost function, every agent is assigned a local scaling factor, and a distributed optimizer is proposed so that the local scaling factors are convergent to the consensual optimality of the global cost function. Then, the expected positions are derived based on the kinematics of the formation center, the nominal configuration, and the optimal scaling factor. A tracking controller is subsequently designed so that formation scaling maneuver is performed when the agents track the expected positions. Particularly, the optimizer follows the gradient tracking framework and is improved by adopting the dynamic average consensus and extended state observer techniques. An experiment on a cluster of quadrotor autonomous aerial vehicles is performed to verify the proposed method."

This study investigates how four learning materials– textbook, comic, video, and game– affect middle- and high school students' ability to interpret line charts, area charts, stacked area charts, and stream graphs. We conducted a comparative classroom study with 68 students, using pre- and post-tests, worksheet activities, and group discussions to assess learning outcomes and understanding. Our results show statistically significant improvement in students' understanding of stacked area charts and stream graphs, while no significant differences between the learning materials were found. This suggests that more factors than initially anticipated– such as engagement, motivation and active learning strategies– influence the learning outcome. The analysis of the worksheets revealed that while students could infer surface-level insights from charts, over 70% struggled to identify underlying patterns or relationships. Additionally, a common challenge across all learning materials was reading fatigue, which often led students to skim content, disengage, or misinterpret key information. These findings highlight the need for educational tools and approaches that foster deeper understanding of unfamiliar visualizations, reduce cognitive load, and encourage active engagement."

    "abstract": "Bearings are critical components in industrial machinery, making fault diagnosis essential for ensuring operational reliability. Due to the rarity of fault conditions, the resulting signal data are extremely scarce compared to normal signal data, resulting in severe class imbalance and biasing traditional diagnostic methods toward the normal states. Researchers have turned to data augmentation to address the aforementioned challenge. However, existing approaches often struggle to capture the correlations between spatiotemporal and conditional information and suffer from inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Spatiotemporal-Conditional information fusion Classifier-Free Guidance Rectified Flow model (SCIF-CFGRF). Specifically, the Continuous Wavelet Transform-based Feature Extraction Network block and the Residual Seaformer block, both carefully designed and integrated into the UNet architecture, enable high-fidelity modeling of high-dimensional Rectified Flow (RF) representations in 2D time–frequency domain signal feature heatmaps, while simultaneously embedding spatiotemporal-conditional information fusion. Furthermore, a dedicated loss function tailored to the characteristics of RF ensures fast and stable convergence during training. Finally, a novel spatiotemporal-conditional information fusion classifier-free guidance inference sampler and Quality Enhancer block complete the efficient and high-quality synthesis of samples. Experiments on two real-world bearing fault datasets and extensive ablation studies demonstrate that SCIF-CFGRF significantly outperforms mainstream methods in terms of synthesis quality and inference speed. Under a 1:5 class balance ratio, SCIF-CFGRF achieves a Cosine Similarity exceeding 0.94 and a diagnostic accuracy of 99.50% on synthetic samples while requiring only 6.7% of the inference time compared to the DDPM-based model.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-linearity third-order 3-bit continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) with 109 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for audio applications. The proposed modulator employs a cascade of integrators with feedforward structure using active RC integrators, a 3-bit flash quantizer, and resistor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) feedback. To address both DAC non-linearity and the tonal issues caused by conventional data weighted averaging (DWA), a new bi-directional advancing DWA (Bi-ADWA) with tone-suppressing and tone-transferring capabilities is introduced. Furthermore, the asymmetry in the rise/fall time of the DAC due to the additional paths introduced by Bi-ADWA is mitigated by optimizing the switch control circuitry and layout of the feedback DAC. Fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS technology, the modulator demonstrates a peak SNDR of 95.8 dB alongside a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DR</i> of 102.5 dB, consuming 0.58 mW at 1.8 V within an active area of 0.8 mm²."

    "abstract": "Conventional humidity sensors often experience performance issues or signal failure in saturated humidity environments due to surface condensation. This limitation significantly reduces their effectiveness in high - humidity industrial applications. To tackle this challenge, this study introduces a condensation resistant fiber Bragg grating (CRFBG) humidity sensor. The sensor comprises four key components: a fiber Bragg grating (FBG), modulus-gradient interfacial transition layer based on KH-550,<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sup> humidity-sensitive coating layer composed of poly(benzimidazole imide) (PBII), and a hydrophobic surface modification layer. The PBII coating layer functions as the humidity-sensing unit, and its surface structure is modified to significantly enhance the hydrophobicity of the sensor. To significantly enhance surface hydrophobicity, thiol silane is integrated into the covalently cross-linked network formed by PBII and polyacrylate (PAA) to establish a covalent interface, leading to the formation of a dense microscale surface structure with high hydrophobicity, which raises the water contact angle of the coating surface to 110°. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CRFBG-sensor exhibits excellent condensation resistance and rapid humidity response under high-temperature and high-humidity conditions. Benefiting from its muti-layer functional design, the sensor is well-suited for real-time relative humidity monitoring in saturated humidity environments, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cell(PEMFC) reactors."

    "abstract": "With the worsening of air pollution, the variety of airborne pollutants has significantly increased. Accurate monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere requires sensors with enhanced precision. If suspended particles in the airflow can be pre-sorted using microfluidic chips, the performance of most existing microfluidic PM detection systems could be significantly improved. In this study, a T-type optofluidic chip (TOPC) for particle sorting and collection was theoretically designed based on optical principles, and an analytical solution for the particle offset distance within the TOPC was derived. Building upon this, a dimensionless parameter S was introduced by incorporating characteristic parameters of the microfluidic chip to describe particle motion within the TOPC. Particle trajectories under varying conditions were calculated using numerical simulations and compared with theoretical predictions to validate the model. In parallel, an experimental platform was constructed. The results demonstrated that the particle offset errors were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.2\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m when compared with the theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, respectively. Furthermore, the particle sorting efficiency obtained from experiments showed strong agreement with the simulation results, confirming that the dimensionless parameter S effectively characterizes particle behavior in the TOPC. The innovation of this work lies in the novel introduction of the dimensionless parameter S and its experimental and numerical validation, providing a robust framework for optimizing TOPC design and enhancing PM sorting precision."

Traditional robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots."

Recently, sensing-assisted communication has gained attention for leveraging environmental sensing data to enhance wireless decision-making. However, existing works mainly focus on incorporating more modalities while neglecting the negative impact of modality redundancy. In practice, certain modalities may contribute little to target tasks and introduce unnecessary computational overhead. To address such issue, we will investigate the representational effectiveness of diverse sensing modalities. Driven by numerical observations, we design a novel model architecture, termed as LRCT-MS, that integrates low-rank fusion mechanism with cross-modal transformer to adaptively select the most task-relevant modality. Simulation results on a real-world multimodal dataset demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in achieving accurate and efficient beam prediction."

DNA sequences reassembly is one of the most expensive and computationally intensive tasks in molecular biology. To solve such complex applications specially conceived high computational power hardware architectures are required. The Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) – based accelerators play a major role in the efforts of shrinking as much possible the processing times related to genes reassembly. This paper focuses on two leading FPGA-based technologies that may be used for DNA reassembly hardware and software implementation purposes. One is the Xilinx EDK (Embedded Development Kit) Platform Studio software toolkit based on the 32bit MicroBlaze soft processor framework. The second one is the Vivado Design Suite toolkit specially developed to program the AMD Zynq 7000 SoC (System-on-a-Chip) family processing units. As well as, two general purpose development boards have been considered for experiments: a Genesys Virtex-5 development board that explores the MicroBlaze soft processor technology, and a ZyboZ7-10 board built upon the Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA hardware platform. On both of them the same DNA processing algorithm has been implemented, with the same gene reads and reference sequences as inputs. Then, the efficiency of the two different hardware architectures programmed under different software technologies has been analyzed. This study focuses mainly on the clock periods required to process the same gene sequences, respectively on the shortest execution times reached on the two development systems. In this way useful information may be collected regarding the utility, respectively the advantages or disadvantages of the above mentioned technologies. Possessing this knowledge, the user can decide then what technology looks more appropriate for its DNA reassembly purposes."

    "abstract": "Objective pain assessment remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the feasibility of detecting laser-induced experimental pain from electroencephalography (EEG) signals using machine learning. Utilizing an open dataset from 51 subjects, binary classification (‘pain’ vs. ‘no-pain’ epochs) was performed based on EEG data segmented according to recorded participant responses. A comprehensive set of time-domain, wavelet-based, and entropy-based features was extracted from each EEG channel. The LightGBM algorithm, a gradient boosting framework, was employed for classification, with accuracy serving as the primary performance metric, justified by the balanced nature of the dataset. The results demonstrate the potential for high accuracy in pain detection, exceeding 0.95 for some individuals. However, a detailed analysis revealed substantial inter-subject variability, indicating that model performance is highly dependent on individual characteristics, often outweighing the influence of specific EEG channels. Furthermore, the choice of features significantly impacted accuracy, with some features proving highly informative while others performed near chance level (accuracy $\\approx 0.5$). While predicting pain intensity faces challenges due to subjective reporting variability, the binary detection approach proved effective. The study highlights the importance of considering individual specificity and careful feature selection in developing EEG-based pain detection systems and discusses methodological considerations such as preventing data leakage and managing the influence of signal processing parameters."

However, the patterns of their distribution in normal and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the location of spines on dendrites in wild-type (Wt) and AD model hippocampal neurons exposed to low levels of beta-amyloid (Ab) toxicity. Spatial clustering methods such as mean distance to nearest neighbor, pairwise correlation function and Moran’s index were used to evaluate grouping, and spatial clustering and spine neighborhoods were also analyzed. The results showed differences in spine density, their mutual distances and clustering between WT and Aβ dendrites, indicating a change in spatial organization during neurodegeneration. The developed methodology allows us to quantify spine clustering and obtain a set of dendrite features, including a probability matrix of spatial arrangement of spines with different morphological features. The results of the analysis demonstrated that there are exact differences in the structure of Ab and Wt dendrites. In addition, a correlation between the morphological features of the spines and their relative position was found."

    "abstract": "Optical methods of glucose measurement in biological media are promising due to their high measurement accuracy. However, this accuracy is not sufficient to justify replacement of the invasive methods due to the radiation source instability caused by the temperature drift and low signal-tonoise ratio when recording attenuated radiation. In addition, the heating rate of the object under study also significantly contributes to the measurement accuracy due to the change in the optical properties as a consequence of the object heating up because of metabolism in tissues and irradiation by the radiation source. In this regard, taking the temperature indicators of the system into account is an important condition for reducing the measurement error. The study considers the influence of the accuracy dependence of non-invasive glucose measurement in a model solution on temperature characteristics of the radiation source, the detector, the object under study and the environment. The experimental setup has been developed, it includes an optical glucose sensor and a set of sensors for reading the ambient temperature, temperature of the radiation source, the detector and the object under study. The algorithm for compensating the influence of the measurement system elements’ temperature characteristics has been developed. A combination of digital filters has been selected to compensate for the noise of the optical pair. Experimental studies on aqueous solutions with various glucose concentrations were carried out. As a result, it was determined that the combination of the proposed technical and software methods can significantly reduce the measurement error."

By designing a hierarchical attention mechanism, the model learns both node attribute features and local/global topological features, and quantifies the differences in the impact of different relationship edges on credit status. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models such as logistic regression and random forest in terms of precision (0.911), weighted F1 value (0.883) and AUC-ROC (0.962), especially for high-risk enterprises, the recall rate reaches 96%, which verifies the effectiveness of graph structure modeling and attention mechanism in risk collaborative perception."

    "abstract": "Advancing technology nodes have significantly increased the complexity of transistor sizing in analog circuit design. Although artificial intelligence (AI) techniques show potential, their lack of integrated domain expertise often leads to slow convergence in practical applications. We propose ASTRA (Automatic Sizing of Transistors with Reasoning Agents), a novel optimization framework that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create structured reasoning pathways between Large Language Models (LLMs), domain knowledge bases, and Bayesian Optimization (BO). ASTRA introduces a two-stage process: first, MCP-guided design initialization that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to quickly identify feasible regions using gm/ID methodology; and second, BO-based optimization focused on critical transistors, identified through LLM reasoning with data-driven validation. A key innovation of ASTRA is its ability to seamlessly integrate with and enhance virtually any existing transistor sizing algorithm at minimal additional cost. Unlike purely data-driven or black-box LLM approaches, ASTRA maintains traceable decision processes that can be verified and refined. Evaluated on three real-world analog circuits, ASTRA enhances multiple classical optimization methods, achieving up to 4.35× fewer simulation iterations and 2.36× performance improvements, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general open-source framework for advancing analog circuit sizing. <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models to predict HF using a comprehensive dataset of 918 patients, compiled from five public sources. Eleven clinical features, including chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and electrocardiogram results, were analyzed for their predictive value. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed significant associations between HF and factors such as asymptomatic chest pain, elevated fasting blood sugar, and abnormal ST segment characteristics. Multiple ML algorithms were evaluated, with a primary focus on maximizing the recall for the No_Disease class of the target feature. While standard and pruned Decision Tree (DT) models exhibited substantial overfitting, ensemble approaches, particularly a pruned Random Forest (RF) model, demonstrated superior generalization, achieving a recall gap of less than 10% for the No_Disease class, and a weighted mean recall (WMR) gap of only 4.96% between the training and testing datasets. Feature importance analysis identified the slope of the ST segment, ST depression (old peak), cholesterol, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and maximum heart rate (HR) as the most influential predictors. These findings underscore the potential of carefully tuned ensemble ML models to enable accurate, early identification of HF, supporting timely clinical intervention and improved patient care."

    "abstract": "In modern digital chips with high power density, a substantial portion of energy is wasted in the power delivery network (PDN), causing thermal issues and voltage drops, which reduces system reliability. Voltage stacking mitigates this problem by connecting power ports of circuits with similar current profiles in series, reusing their charge, and enabling a reduction in PDN loss. Still, it suffers from voltage ripple and power delivery loss due to the current imbalance of stacked circuits. Even in identical circuits, these imbalances arise from activity variations in CMOS logic. To address this issue, this paper presents TickTockStack, a voltage-stacked vector processor designed through architecture-circuit co-optimization. A vector processor was selected for its synchronized instruction execution across lanes, which minimizes control-driven variation in stacked domains. To mitigate the remaining data-dependent imbalance, the datapath was implemented using clocked dual-rail domino (DRD) logic with constant activity factor and differential structure, the register file was realized as a fully differential latch-based structure with symmetrical multiplexers, and the single-ended control logic uses CMOS gates. The processor was evaluated using standard benchmarks, demonstrating a 6.2× reduction in stack voltage ripple and a 33.5% lower power delivery loss on average compared to a stacked CMOS baseline, enhancing stacking reliability. The area overhead of 18.4% was 4.9x lower than that of a switched-capacitor regulator for equivalent ripple reduction, and unlike subthreshold balancing, the proposed method imposes no limitations on maximum operating frequency."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces HyperEF 2.0, a scalable framework for spectral coarsening and clustering of large-scale hypergraphs through hyperedge effective resistances, aiming to decompose hypergraphs into multiple node clusters with a small number of inter-cluster hyperedges. Building on the recent HyperEF framework, our approach offers three primary contributions. Specifically, first, by leveraging the expanded Krylov subspace exploiting both clique and star expansions of hyperedges, we can significantly improve the approximation accuracy of effective resistances. Second, we propose a resistance-based local clustering scheme for merging small isolated nodes into nearby clusters, yielding more balanced clusters with substantially improved conductance. Third, the proposed HyperEF 2.0 enables the integration of resistance-based hyperedge weighting and community detection into a multilevel hypergraph partitioning tool, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments on real-world VLSI benchmarks show that HyperEF 2.0 can more effectively coarsen hypergraphs without compromising their structural properties, while delivering much better solution quality (e.g. conductance) than the state-of-the-art hypergraph coarsening methods, such as HyperEF and HyperSF. Moreover, compared to leading hypergraph partitioners such as hMETIS, SpecPart, MedPart, and KaHyPar, our framework consistently achieves smaller cut sizes. In terms of runtime, HyperEF 2.0 attains up to a 4.5× speedup over the latest flow-based local clustering algorithm, HyperSF, demonstrating both superior efficiency and partitioning quality."

    "abstract": "Yield analysis has grown in significance with the increasing integration of SRAM arrays. The post-layout simulation introduces strong inter-column correlations in SRAM caused by parasitic parameters, thereby complicating yield analysis. However, most existing methods only consider the pre-layout simulation of SRAM circuits. In this paper, we present BAGNet: a boundary-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) for SRAM yield analysis in post-layout simulation. We introduce a GNN module that learns the graph representations of SRAM arrays while generating feature vectors. We then construct an accurate surrogate model by the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to provide predictions for circuit performances. Given that delineating failure boundaries is vital for yield estimation, we propose an innovative nonlinear mapping strategy and an adaptive iterative strategy integrated with BAGNet, thus endowing our model with boundary-aware capability. After the model is built, we employ the importance sampling (IS) method on our surrogate model to deliver efficient and accurate yield estimation without time-consuming circuit simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method with 1.823.52x speedup, without losing accuracy."

Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose TOGGLE (Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without re-training or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3× reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware."

    "abstract": "With the rise of 3-D integration technology, the back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects start to play an important role in thermal analysis, as they inevitably occupy the main thermal dissipation path of the active devices in 3-D ICs. High-resolution full-chip thermal resistance extraction of BEOL interconnects is thus needed to obtain accurate temperatures of local hotspots, which renders rigorous numerical simulation based extraction methods unaffordable. Several analytical models have been proposed for efficient full-chip thermal resistance extraction of BEOL interconnects, but they are very inaccurate due to the inability to consider the detailed via connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical model based on the resistor network theory and the Woodbury formula. Our model takes the detailed via connectivity into consideration and achieves a 3.4× improvement in accuracy compared with the previous work, with negligible time overhead. Owing to the accuracy improvement in the extracted thermal resistances, we reduce the absolute percentage error of the maximum temperature predicted by further thermal analysis of a 3-D IC based on the extracted thermal resistances from 5.2% to 1.8%, compared with the previous work."

To overcome the limitations of prior technologies like 3D cross-point memory (3DXP), Selector-Only Memory (SOM) has recently emerged as a promising candidate for next-generation SCM. However, SOM devices face various reliability challenges that limit their ability to function as ideal memory devices. Among various non-ideal characteristics, threshold voltage (V<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</inf>) drift, which increases V<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</inf> over time, has been identified as a critical issue that raises the error rate of SOM. Moreover, device variation caused by immature manufacturing processes results in V<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</inf> discrepancies across devices, reducing the read window margin (RWM) and thus contributing to an increased error rate. In response to these issues, we propose Securer, consisting of self-error detection and correction techniques that inherently detect and correct errors for SOM, without relying on external methods such as error correction codes (ECC). The first technique effectively identifies all errors through a dual-polarity read operation, leveraging the unique features of SOM. For the second technique, an analytical drift estimation model is introduced to estimate the magnitude of V<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</inf> drift experienced by erroneous cells.

With an interactive interface, users can modify both data mappings and visual design elements while maintaining the original visualization's aesthetic quality.

    "abstract": "Robust registration of multimodal remote sensing images (MRSIs) remains a challenge due to nonlinear intensity differences (NIDs) and geometric distortions. Existing methods typically rely on maximum index maps (MIMs) to construct feature descriptors. However, MIM is sensitive to rotation variations, under which circumstance the number of correct matches decreases under severe geometric distortions. To address these problems, this study proposes an ingenious registration method (named as CSFD-AFM) based on a cyclic shift feature descriptor (CSFD) and an adaptive feature matching (AFM). The CSFD is a rotation-invariant descriptor that enables efficient orientation adjustment through cyclic shifts of a three-dimensional feature array constructed from a modified MIM. To achieve rotation invariance, a dominant-orientation-based method for cyclic shift is introduced. Based on the CSFD, we devise a matching strategy named AFM, which adaptively adjusts the scale and orientation of CSFDs for robust and accurate feature matching. Experiments were conducted on six MRSI datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed CSFD-AFM. The results suggest that the proposed CSFD-AFM outperforms the existing seven state-of-the-art methods including ReDFeat, MINIMA-LG, RIFT2, MS-HLMO, HOWP, POS-GIFT, and GLS-MIFT. In addition, our proposed CSFD-AFM achieves the accuracy within 2 pixels while maintaining its robustness against severe geometric distortions such as large rotations."

    "abstract": "To address the unresolved challenge of angle tracking performance degradation and potential instability in steer-by-wire systems under actuator input saturation and faults, this paper proposes a novel saturation-tolerant adaptive prescribed performance tracking control scheme. The approach uniquely integrates event-triggered mechanisms and adaptive auxiliary systems into a unified finite-time prescribed performance control framework, enabling adaptive compensation for saturation-induced errors and accommodating multi-task steering characteristics of “action-wait” intermittent control. Importantly, the inherent initial condition constraints and potential singularity issues found in conventional prescribed performance control are eliminated, ensuring tracking errors remain within the performance envelope while enhancing the system’s transient response. To simultaneously address time-varying disturbances and unmeasurable states, a new high-order finite-time extended state observer is developed, removing the need to design two separate observers. In addition, an adaptive angle tracking controller with disturbance compensation is constructed using the dynamic surface control technique, where a new finite-time convergent nonlinear filter is introduced to avoid cumbersome computations and error accumulation. Finally, hardware experiments verify the superiority and real-time capability of the proposed method, with a computation time of 0.24 ms confirming its suitability for embedded automotive applications."

Subsequently, reconstruction can be performed within the framework of snapshot compressive imaging from the resulting aliased measurement. This method bypasses the conventional power scaling issue, a critical limitation of current TDI-CCD sensors, ensuring that an increase in spectral bands does not lead to a corresponding increase in readout power dissipation. Numerical experiments performed on ten distinct scenes demonstrate the method’s capacity for robust reconstruction, achieving average scores of Q14 = 0.903, SAM = 1.729, ERGAS = 1.774, SSIM = 0.96, and PSNR = 34.7dB."

    "abstract": "The growing need for remote immersive collaboration across various societal fields like education, healthcare, and training has given rise to the emergence of Networked Collaborative Virtual Reality (NCVR), where users interact in shared virtual spaces over the network. In such context, the effectiveness of the collaboration will be determined by the quality of the interaction among the users and their perceived quality. However, understanding the user perception in NCVR is complex due to the interplay between network conditions, especially latency and individual user responses. Thus, there is a need for accurate modeling of user perception that could provide fast assessments of the user perception during the collaborative session. Traditionally, assessing user perception has been performed either by subjective studies, where users rank the perceived quality of the content after the session, or by objective metrics, which provide a measure of the quality of the content as compared to the original counterpart. These approaches fall short with NCVR, where not only the quality of the content, but of the interaction and the user’s well-being will be key. Physiological signals offer a promising pathway to capture the nuances of the user experience, yet their analysis is challenging due to their inherent complexity and individual variability. This paper makes two key contributions: first, it presents a thorough correlation analysis between user perception and physiological signals. Second, it introduces a novel machine learning method that integrates network performance metrics with physiological data to predict user perception in NCVR environments. The proposed approach was evaluated using an experimental dataset comprising heart activity and network performance data collected from users engaged in a collaborative VR task in the presence of latency-related impairments. Results indicated that combining network data with physiological signals improves prediction accuracy, achieving up to 84% accuracy for latency perception."

However, the occurrence of sensor faults with the cl-DBS system degrades the system accuracy and threatens patients from a safety perspective. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sensor fault-tolerant approach based on an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Neural Network-based Model Predictive Controller (IT3FNN-MPC) to handle the system faults during the stimulation operation. The proposed scheme is developed in two stages: i) a predictive controller based on IT3FNN with three-layer membership functions ameliorates the performance of the closed-loop system under measurement noises and faults while suppressing the effect of tremor signals under adverse situations, and ii) in this structure, a compensatory controller is adopted to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop DBS. Unlike the tolerant interval type 2-MPC (IT2F-MPC), which utilizes a two-layer membership architecture, IT3FNN-MPC is a three-layer hierarchical fuzzy membership mechanism that ameliorates the modeling precision of higher-order uncertainties and nonlinearities in system dynamics. The performance of the proposed sensor fault-tolerant scheme has been verified under various levels of fault scenarios. Comprehensive examinations reveal superior performance of the proposed sensor fault-tolerant for the advanced Parkinson’s disease treatment than sensor fault-tolerant IT2-MPC, H∞ fault-tolerant MPC, and fuzzy type-1 proportional integral (TFPI)."

Federated Domain Generalization (FDG) synergistically combines Federated Learning (FL) and Domain Generalization methodologies, enabling collaborative model development across distributed data sources while maintaining strict data privacy. However, achieving robust generalization performance under domain shifts in federated settings remains an open research challenge. In this paper, we propose FedDGKA, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained CLIP as a teacher model to guide the training of compact student models for improved cross-domain generalization. To address the substantial computational and communication overhead associated with deploying large-scale vision-language models in resource-constrained environments, we introduce a lightweight attention-based adapter module that efficiently distills domain-invariant knowledge while enabling task-specific adaptation with minimal client-side overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets—PACS, OfficeHome, and VLCS—demonstrate that FedDGKA not only achieves superior generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods but also significantly reduces both computational requirements and communication costs in the federated learning process."

It realizes the explicit modeling of the generation logic and process tracing. Through efficient parameter fine-tuning of DeepSeek-7B using LoRA, the aim is to adapt to the multi-stage generation mechanism of TriGen, clarify the semantic goals and output formats of each stage, and achieve model specialization adaptation in low-resource environments. Further, a multi-dimensional closed-loop feedback mechanism is introduced to support local correction and quality iteration. To support research in Chinese scenarios, a high-quality Chinese software requirement dataset containing 2120 labeled samples is constructed, covering scenarios such as functional descriptions and interaction logic. Experimental results show that TriGen significantly outperforms the baseline method in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. The semantic-level precision, recall, and F1 score reach 0.825, 0.819, and 0.801 respectively, with an hallucination rate controlled at 0.183, and the human rating is 0.94.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) decouples the control plane from data plane to shift the complexity from core network devices. Moreover, Intent-Based Networking (IBN), when integrated with SDN, provides a centralized and programmable platform to translate high level user intents into actionable network configurations. This paper proposes a hybrid quality of service (QoS)-aware routing framework that combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with adaptive Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support intentdriven decision-making in SDN. The AHP module interprets user-defined service intents into weighted QoS priorities, while the AI component dynamically refines these weights based on the network telemetry. This integration enables context-aware path selection that balances structure, adaptability, and explainability. Experimental results on real-world network topologies demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmark and state-of-the-art approaches in terms of end-to-end (E2E) delay, packet loss, jitter, throughput, and intent satisfaction. Moreover, the system achieves fast re-routing convergence and maintains a low controller overhead, making it suitable for scalable, transparent, and high-performance deployment in IBN-compliant SDN infrastructures."

A C-band 960 Gb/s (240 Gb/s/λ × 4λ) PAM4 WDM IM/DD transmission system was experimentally constructed using four independent lasers over 1.4 km anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (AR-HCF). Experimental results demonstrate the proposed MTL equalizer consistently outperforms single-task equalizers across the tested channels while reducing parameter count by approximately 57%, significantly improving both equalization performance and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Multimodal probability distributions are common in both quantum and classical systems, yet modeling them remains challenging when the number of modes is large or unknown. Classical methods such as mixture-density networks (MDNs) scale poorly, requiring parameter counts that grow quadratically with the number of modes. We introduce a Quantum Mixture-Density Network (Q-MDN) that employs parameterized quantum circuits to efficiently model multimodal distributions. By representing an exponential number of modes with a compact set of qubits and parameters, Q-MDN predicts Gaussian mixture components with high resolution. We evaluate Q-MDN on two benchmark tasks: the quantum double-slit experiment and chaotic logistic bifurcation. In both cases, Q-MDN outperforms classical MDNs in mode separability and prediction sharpness under equal parameter budgets. Our results demonstrate an advantage in probabilistic regression and highlight the potential of quantum machine learning in capturing complex stochastic behavior beyond the reach of classical models."

However, comprehensively evaluating these models in circuit design remains challenging due to the narrow scope of existing benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMCircuitEval, the first multimodal benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLM performance comprehensively across diverse EDA tasks. MMCircuitEval comprises 3614 meticulously curated question-answer (QA) pairs spanning digital and analog circuits across critical EDA stages—ranging from general knowledge and specifications to front-end and back-end design. Derived from textbooks, technical question banks, datasheets, and real-world documentation, each QA pair undergoes rigorous expert review for accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning, computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and complex computations, highlighting the critical need for targeted training datasets and modeling approaches. MMCircuitEval provides a foundational resource for advancing MLLMs in EDA, facilitating their integration into real-world circuit design workflows.

In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighted ranking for critical document selection and fine-tune a text generator to answer wafer-related questions.

In this work, we propose SubtreeLU, a high-performance parallel sparse LU factorization framework tailored for circuit simulation.

Extensive experiments on 46 circuit matrices demonstrate that SubtreeLU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in terms of accuracy, runtime, and scalability.

To improve resource utilization efficiency, the framework adopts non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology, enabling multiple vehicles to share the same resource block. Addressing the prolonged task offloading latency challenge in NOMA-based IoV systems, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach named DRL-RPSO (DRL-based Resource management, Power splitting, and Speed Optimization), which utilizes the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

The use of synchronous analysis allows us to identify and study in more detail the morphological features of the high-frequency signal recorded by ultra-high-resolution electrocardiography. The high-frequency cardiac cycle obtained as a result of the synchronous accumulation procedure has some morphological features indicating the presence of coronary heart disease, which appear earlier than the standard signs of this pathology recorded on a classic electrocardiogram. Calculation of the spectrum of the obtained cardiac cycles corresponding to different states of the biological object demonstrates the presence of the most clearly changing frequency regions. The study of these frequency regions allows for more accurate diagnostics of the development of markers characteristic of the presence of myocardial infarction. Further improvement of the method helps to improve the performance of diagnostically important markers of the presence of cardiac pathologies."

    "abstract": "The rapidly expanding size and computational complexity of AI models in the past several years has necessitated methods for managing growing memory footprint and matching the computational needs of these models. Novel AI accelerators, such as the Graphcore IPU, attempt to address these needs through expanding on-chip memory and enabling massive data parallelism with hundreds of compute cores. Even with more on-chip memory than GPUs, the IPU can suffer from costly on-chip/off-chip memory transactions. Lossy compression can mitigate this bottleneck, improving IPU performance.Our work explores the use of lossy compression of activation data as a means to improve memory utilization and reduce communication overheads within and across IPU devices. We make the following contributions: 1) We study limitations of the software stack of the IPU (and other AI accelerators) complicating the integration of compression in DNN pipelines. 2) To address these issues, we propose a tool that unrolls the backward pass of a DNN, facilitating activation access and enabling compression. Our tool converts a text-based model representation to a PyTorch-level representation with compression/decompression calls and custom gradient operations. 2) We integrate a DCT-based compressor and quantization to reduce activation sizes on the IPU. 3) We model multi-IPU performance with/without compression. 4) We evaluate activation compression performance across single IPU and multi-IPU configurations using different parallelism modes. When compared with using a single IPU with no compression, we observe 1.1-3.5X speedups on one IPU, 17-20X speedups using two pipelined IPUs, over 16X speedup using 16 data parallel IPUs, and over 185X speedup using 16 IPUs with a mix of pipeline and data parallelism."

    "abstract": "Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the quality of these choices—raising the question of whether they truly contribute to effective technology mapping. This paper introduces CRISTAL, a novel methodology and framework to constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, CRISTAL introduces a novel flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, includes representative logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with choice network construction and validation. Through these techniques, CRISTAL constructs fewer but higher-quality choices. Our experimental results demonstrate that CRISTAL outperforms the state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction implemented in ABC in the post-mapping stage, achieving average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and a 63.77% runtime reduction on large-scale cases, across a diverse set of combinational circuits from the IWLS 2005, ISCAS’89, and EPFL benchmark suites."

However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41× speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3× speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation."

The exact-match-based preseeding filter has emerged as an effective and general methodology to address this issue, capable of removing 70% to 80% of exact-matched genomic reads at the source and applicable to a wide range of alignment tools.

By harnessing the two-dimensional input capability of 3D NAND flash memory and integrating group testing methods, our design enables comparisons across hundreds of pages in a single read cycle and supports simultaneous multi-query searches. Combined with a Bloom filter for in-NAND search, our architecture significantly reduces data movement by 48% to 96%, achieves a speedup of 1.60× to 4.99× over GenStore, and delivers 30% higher energy efficiency with only a 4.5% circuit overhead."

In this work, we propose ZeroSim, a transformer-based performance modeling framework designed to achieve robust in-distribution generalization across trained topologies under novel parameter configurations and zero-shot generalization to unseen topologies without any fine-tuning. We apply three key enabling strategies: (1) a diverse training corpus of 3.6 million instances covering over 60 amplifier topologies, (2) unified topology embeddings leveraging global-aware tokens and hierarchical attention to robustly generalize to novel circuits, and (3) a topology-conditioned parameter mapping approach that maintains consistent structural representations independent of parameter variations. Our experimental results demonstrate that ZeroSim significantly outperforms baseline models such as multilayer perceptrons, graph neural networks and transformers, delivering accurate zero-shot predictions across different amplifier topologies. Additionally, when integrated into a reinforcement learning-based parameter optimization pipeline, ZeroSim achieves a remarkable speedup (13×) compared to conventional SPICE simulations, underscoring its practical value for a wide range of analog circuit design automation tasks."

    "abstract": "Late-stage placement optimization is where real PPA trade-offs surface, and where conventional heuristic passes tend to get trapped in small, local neighborhoods. We frame an invited \"Problem C\" contest that treats this stage as a global, multi-operator search over gate sizing, buffer/inverter-pair insertion, and legal cell relocation, with strict reproducibility and legality. Our core belief grounded in production experience is that GPU batching and differentiable guidance expand the tractable search space: you can score and steer thousands of coordinated moves per iteration, not just a handful, and do so under tight runtime budgets. Submissions must produce a replayable ECO changelist and a final legal DEF; a standardized evaluation flow computes timing, power, and wirelength and combines them with displacement and runtime into the contest score. The specification is designed to encourage pragmatic use of gradient signals and tensorized batching without mandating any single method, enabling participants to leverage novel GPU tools to deliver industrially deployable PPA gains."

    "abstract": "X-ray diffractometers using cryocooler are extremely useful instruments for identifying materials and determining crystal structures of crystalline samples. The physical properties of the samples are measured while varying external conditions such as temperature, pressure, and magnetic field. Although permanent magnets are used in X-ray diffractometers to apply magnetic fields, permanent magnets cannot change the magnetic field. While a normal electromagnet can change the magnetic field strength, the magnetic field strength is exceptionally low and generates heat due to the energizing current. Furthermore, a problem with current X-ray diffractometers is that the space available for installing magnets is limited. In this study, a two-axis superconducting split coil with a variable magnetic field angle that can be installed in a cylindrical space with a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 50 mm was studied. The target magnetic field strength is 0.5 T and field error in the sample size (1 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>) is 5%. Regarding the shape of the main split coil for the z-axis, two types of coils using LTS and HTS wires were designed, and their performance was compared. A compact 2-axis split superconducting coil using REBCO wire was fabricated, and the performance of the generated magnetic field (field strength and applied angle) was measured in liquid nitrogen. In the case of a compact 2-axis split coil wound with HTS wire, the target value of 0.5 T can be sufficiently achieved by operating it at 40 K."

    "abstract": "With the worsening of air pollution, the variety of airborne pollutants has significantly increased. Accurate monitoring of particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere requires sensors with enhanced precision. If suspended particles in the airflow can be pre-sorted using microfluidic chips, the performance of most existing microfluidic PM detection systems could be significantly improved. In this study, a T-type optofluidic chip (TOPC) for particle sorting and collection was theoretically designed based on optical principles, and an analytical solution for the particle offset distance within the TOPC was derived. Building upon this, a dimensionless parameter S was introduced by incorporating characteristic parameters of the microfluidic chip to describe particle motion within the TOPC. Particle trajectories under varying conditions were calculated using numerical simulations and compared with theoretical predictions to validate the model. In parallel, an experimental platform was constructed. The results demonstrated that the particle offset errors were <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4.2\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula>m and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.4\\mu $</tex-math> </inline-formula> m when compared with the theoretical calculations and numerical simulations, respectively.

The innovation of this work lies in the novel introduction of the dimensionless parameter S and its experimental and numerical validation, providing a robust framework for optimizing TOPC design and enhancing PM sorting precision."

    "abstract": "The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM’s perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Traditional methods use Zernike polynomials to fit the test surface form and indirectly infer the reference surface form, which can lead to error accumulation. In this article, we propose a neural absolute testing method that uses an advanced neural radiance field to directly model the reference surface form, thereby reducing error accumulation. The proposed framework includes an invariant surface branch and a variant surface branch; the sum of these two branches is expected to closely approximate the measured data under varying rotations and shifts. Consequently, a self-supervised training strategy has been developed to optimize the model parameters, eliminating the need for extensive training datasets with ground truth labels. Synthetic experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior absolute calibration accuracy compared to the traditional Zernike polynomial approach. Furthermore, real-world experiments performed using a Fizeau interferometer confirm that the proposed method produces a more robust reference surface form than the classical Zernike polynomial technique."

    "abstract": "Motion planning for autonomous vehicles in dense, complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. The key issues lie in the trajectory safety and the path-speed coupling. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Safety-Guaranteed Trajectory Planning algorithm (SGTP) using a gap-oriented spatio-temporal corridor. Firstly, the candidate lanes for the ego vehicle are determined based on road topology and navigation information. Then, considering the uncertainty of surrounding traffic, the risk of each surrounding vehicle is assessed, and their occupied areas are safety-guaranteed according to a calculated risk field, enabling the construction of a dynamic spatio-temporal gap distribution map. By evaluating the cost of gap transitions, a tree-search strategy determines the optimal gap sequence. Subsequently, a spatio-temporal safety corridor is generated around the target gap sequence. Within this corridor, a reference trajectory is initialized using an Intelligent Driver Model integrated with Dynamic Programming (IDM-DP), and a safe, feasible, and smooth trajectory is optimized under the corridor constraints. Finally, SGTP is extensively validated on the nuPlan benchmark dataset. Experimental results demonstrate its outstanding performance in collision avoidance and driving efficiency. Compared to existing methods, SGTP achieves significant improvements in overall performance and safety metrics, highlighting its effectiveness for reliable motion planning in complex, interaction-intensive traffic environments."

Unlike the traditional EV chargers that use interleaved boost converters and inductors to perform the charging functionalities, this new approach uses the vehicle’s motor as a coupled inductor. In addition, the inverter used to control the motor during propulsion is also used as an interleaved power factor correction (PFC) boost converter to charge the EV battery. With little to no hardware modifications, dual functionality is made possible by the motor's built-in capabilities, which ensure optimal power flow during the battery charging stage. This paper thoroughly examines the modeling and operational modes of the proposed charger. Mathematical analysis and simulations are also done on the motor to ensure the charger generates zero torque during charging mode. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed charger is evaluated, a controller is developed, and detailed simulation and experimental results are provided on a 3-kW charger. The research findings proved that the proposed charger is robust with a 93.9% experimental efficiency and a THD of 2.23%."

Existing studies face challenges in visualizing and analyzing combat tactics due to the complexity and the multifaceted characteristics of the decision-making data. To address these challenges, we introduce TactiVis, a visual analytics system designed for analyzing combat decision-making behavior. Using MOBA game as a representative case of team-based combat, TactiVis adopts a macro-to-micro tactics visual analytics framework consisting of three stages: match-level analysis, event-level understanding, and character-level comparison. In the TactiVis system, we introduce the v-storyline visualization, which encodes positions along the vertical axis to reveal tactical patterns. Case studies and a usability study demonstrate the utility and usability of TactiVis for helping analysts understand combat patterns and analyze tactics."

    "abstract": "Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework’s optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/ RINS-T."

    "abstract": "Secure implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptosystems (PQC) is becoming critical as the world migrates towards quantum-safe cryptography. Fault attacks (FA) are practical threats affecting cryptographic implementations on both embedded and native, multi-user systems. Although research on FAs targeting PQC algorithms is well-paced for embedded systems (typically with physical adversarial access), exploration of such threats for native systems (typically with remote adversarial access) requires further attention. The type of faults and, consequently, the attack algorithms differ significantly between embedded and native systems.In this paper, we present a systematic approach to evaluate PQC algorithms against Rowhammer – a remote, software-controlled fault injection vector in native and cloud-based systems. Unlike conventional ways in cryptography, where an attack is first developed in theory and then demonstrated on target platform(s), we take a system-specific approach by first characterizing the fault model of a target platform and then exploiting these faults to devise a suitable theoretical attack. This approach helps the attacker quickly converge to an attack optimized for the target system. Also, if exercised successfully for targets with low fault susceptibility, it finds attacks potentially affecting a large number of targets. Our approach is demonstrated for SPHINCS+, the NIST standard for stateless hash-based digital signatures. We discovered a novel Rowhammer-based forgery attack and demonstrated it for DDR3 and DDR4 DRAMs. The attacks were carried out on the standard implementation of SPHINCS+ and for the liboqs library. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing a forgery attack using Rowhammer on SPHINCS+."

Analog in-sensor (AIS) hardware architectures address this bottleneck by enabling analog processing directly within the sensor, minimizing digitization and data movement. However, AIS deployments face key challenges including stringent power, performance, and area constraints, susceptibility to hardware-induced noise and variations, and accuracy degradation from operating on unprocessed sensor outputs rather than refined image data. We address these challenges through a software-driven, hardware-aware analysis that distills actionable design guidance for AIS-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Drawing on prior literature and our own empirical studies, we derive design recommendations for AIS-friendly network topologies, training recipes that jointly improve noise and quantization robustness, and strategies for effective learning from emulated raw sensor data without a digital image signal processing (ISP) pipeline. This analysis provides insight into hardware-aware software-based techniques that complement cutting-edge circuit and architecture-level approaches, helping advance the limits of high-performance AIS systems."

Modern TFHE implementations support multiple plaintext encoding spaces, each offering distinct trade-offs between computational cost and the expressiveness enabled by larger plaintext domains. Smartly switching between encoding strategies to maximize evaluation efficiency remains challenging due to the lack of algorithmic support for determining when and where such transitions should occur. To address this, we propose a synthesis framework that enables encoding-switch-aware TFHE circuit generation. Our approach leverages the structural properties of the exclusive-or sum of products (ESOP) representation to partition Boolean functions into encoding-aligned regions, enabling cost-effective evaluation while minimizing switch overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our encoding-aware synthesis technique significantly accelerates homomorphic Boolean function evaluation – achieving up to 53.46% and 23.34% average evaluation time reduction on general-purpose Boolean benchmarks – compared to advanced synthesis baselines lacking explicit encoding-switch management. This work lays the groundwork for systematic encoding strategy management in TFHE circuits and highlights the role of logic-level design automation in advancing efficient homomorphic evaluation."

However, this advancement intensifies the challenges of multi-physics interactions, particularly the intricate coupling between electromagnetic (EM) and thermal fields. Thermal and EM optimizations of 3D ICs often require extensive and complex Partial Differential Equation (PDE) simulations. Neural network-based field solvers are renowned for their high efficiency and accuracy. However, existing approaches are often trained using results from traditional physical field solvers, which are time-consuming and lack compatibility with more complex design configurations. In this paper, for the first time, we propose 3D CoSim, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based simulator for multi-physics analysis with arbitrary 3D IC configurations. 3D CoSim has a sophisticated computational framework that learns the nonlinear functional mappings from geometrical and physical setups to multiphysics fields. Leveraging a Multi-input DeepONet architecture, 3D CoSim integrates multiple PDE configurations. This integration encompasses the heat equation, Maxwell’s equations, and a diverse range of boundary conditions, thereby enabling the derivation of a unified solution for both EM and thermal fields. This integration delivers a paradigm shift in simulation efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CoSim achieves a speedup of 844× to 7600× compared to traditional COMSOL while maintaining comparable accuracy of 97% for EM simulation and 99.8% for thermal simulation."

Introducing additional weight sparsity can further improve their energy efficiency when implemented in hardware. We propose SPARSH, a novel memory organization technique that uses sparse hashing to allow efficient storage and fast access while minimizing memory over-provisioning. Through SPARSH, we make the following four key contributions. First, we introduce an efficient hash function to evenly distribute nonzero weights to buckets that are optimized for an FPGA memory system and placed in a compact memory space to achieve storage efficiency. Second, we use a controller that integrates a Bloom filter to detect sparsity and skip memory accesses for weights and activations that are zero, and for neurons that are in refractory state. This improves memory bandwidth utilization. Third, we propose a scheduler that improves memory latency by prioritizing accesses that hit in the same bucket over other accesses. Finally, we propose an algorithm to select the design parameters of SPARSH based on the sparsity of a target SNN. We implement SPARSH for a recent SNN accelerator on a Virtex UltraScale and evaluate using seven SNNs models. We show that SPARSH reduces memory over-provisioning by 3.2×, access latency by 77%, and bandwidth utilization by 68% with a marginal increase in resource utilization."

Existing benchmark suites are frequently capped in size due to the time-consuming creation procedure, which limits the number of samples in a dataset. Profiling multiple characteristics for each benchmark in order to better characterize and understand its behavior results in a high feature-to-sample ratio. Traditional workload characterization techniques, such as those employing principal component analysis (PCA), can be challenging in high-dimensional spaces, particularly when dealing with limited sample sizes. This paper presents a novel multilevel PCA approach that addresses these issues. Our approach extracts information from three unique layers: microarchitecture-independent, compiler intermediate representation (IR), and source code layers, to provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of application characteristics.Our methodology, cross-layer multilevel PCA (CMPCA), applies PCA hierarchically at multiple levels to effectively reduce dimensionality while preserving crucial information. Furthermore, we integrate clustering techniques to identify representative benchmarks, significantly reducing the dataset size (53.8X). The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms standard PCA and single-layer characterization approaches, achieving higher accuracy in speedup calculations for representative benchmarks compared to the entire dataset.

Subsequently, we analyze the results and devise a static graphics scaling approach to adapt to the application behavior. Experimental results show a 43% reduction in energy consumption of the benchmark, while maintaining image similarity scores comparable to high settings."

We propose approaches by reusing existing LPDDR6 and HBM memory through a logic die that connects to the SoC using UCIe. We also propose an approach where the DRAM die natively supports UCIe instead of the LPDDR6 bus interface. Our approaches result in significantly higher bandwidth density (up to 10x), lower latency (up to 3x), lower power (up to 3x), and lower cost compared to existing HBM4 and LPDDR on-package memory solutions."

    "abstract": "Accurate wide area network (WAN) bandwidth (BW) is essential for geo-distributed data analytics (GDA) systems to make optimal decisions such as data and task placement to improve performance. Existing GDA systems, however, measure WAN BW statically and independently between data centers (DCs), while data transfer occurs dynamically and simultaneously among DCs during workload execution. Also, they use a single connection WAN BW that cannot capture actual WAN capacities between distant DCs. Such inaccurate WAN BWs yield sub-optimal decisions, inflating overall query latency and cost. In this paper, we present WANify, a new framework that precisely and dynamically gauges achievable runtime WAN BW using a machine learning prediction scheme, decision tree-based Random Forest. This helps GDA systems make better decisions yielding reduced latency and costs including WAN BW monitoring costs. Based on predicted runtime WAN BW, WANify determines the optimal number of heterogeneous parallel connections for data transfer among DCs. This approach improves performance without additional, or even at reduced cost, by fully exploiting available WAN capacities. In addition, WANify considers dynamics like network and workloads, and heterogeneity like skewed data, heterogeneous compute resources, and a varying number of DCs while making decisions. The WANify prototype running on state-of-the-art GDA systems is evaluated on AWS with 8 geo-distributed DCs. Results show that WANify enhances WAN throughput by balancing between the strongest and weakest WAN links, enabling GDA systems to reduce latency and cost by up to 26% and 16% respectively with minimal effort, all while handling dynamics and heterogeneity efficiently."

This is the primary goal of developing our device that will allow for the early detection of seizures and prevent the occurrence of serious injuries in patients. The developed wearable device performs long-term monitoring of the patient’s condition, the method is based on recording a Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and accelerometer data. Comprehensive assessment of photoplethysmography indicators combined with accelerometer data allows for the identification of predictive markers for an epileptic seizure.

    "abstract": "Optimizing power, performance, and area in IC designs remains a key focus. However, the limited functionality of standard cell libraries restricts further optimization. A promising solution involves developing customized complex gates that integrate multiple basic gate functions into a single gate at the transistor level. While prior research has extensively explored transistor network optimization of the complex gates, most studies still focus on 1-stage networks, limiting the potential for deeper optimization. Furthermore, existing methodologies often neglect considering transistor placement during network synthesis, potentially leading to suboptimal area even if the transistor count is reduced. To address these limitations, we propose MuSTNet, a SAT-based exact synthesis framework that minimizing transistor networks by incorporating two key innovations: (1) multi-stage hierarchy for deeper optimization, and (2) transistor placement constraints to simultaneously minimize both transistor count and physical area. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSTNet surpasses previous studies, achieving an 18% reduction in transistor count for 4-input P-class functions and a 12.9% reduction for multi-output functions. When applied to an industrial library benchmark, MuSTNet yields a 6.3% area reduction compared to the approach neglecting placement constraints. Moreover, MuSTNet has been applied to complex gate generation, allowing simultaneous functional and topological optimization at the transistor level. Compared to traditional cell-level design, this approach reduces transistor count by 12.3% and area by 21.4%, demonstrating its potential in advanced IC design."

Additionally, VeriSAT shows a 30x speedup over the popular CPU-based MiniSat solver for specific datasets, validating the effectiveness of our design optimizations.VeriSAT represents a significant leap forward in FPGA-based SAT solving, offering unprecedented efficiency through its hardware-tailored design.

As these models are increasingly deployed in shared Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) environments via Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), concerns around their security grow. In particular, the risk of side-channel attacks that reveal architectural details without physical access remains under-explored, despite the high value of the proprietary models they target. This work to the best of our knowledge is the first to investigate GPU power and thermal fluctuations as side-channels and further exploit them to extract information from pre-trained transformer models. The proposed analysis shows how these side channels can be exploited at user-privilege to reveal critical architectural details such as encoder/decoder layer and attention head for both language and vision transformers. We demonstrate the practical impact by evaluating multiple language and vision pre-trained transformers which are publicly available. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that the attack model achieves a high accuracy of over 89% on average for model family identification and 100% for hyperparameter classification, in both single-process as well as noisy multi-process scenarios. Moreover, by leveraging the extracted architectural information, we demonstrate highly effective black-box transfer adversarial attacks with an average success rate exceeding 93%, underscoring the security risks posed by GPU side-channel leakage in deployed transformer models."

The M3 framework employs the Mamba architecture, a recently emerging model regarded as a potential alternative to the Transformer. It combines model-based RL with a dynamic scheduling mechanism that adapts RL parameters to balance exploration (seeking novel designs) and exploitation (refining existing ones). Experimental results demonstrate that M3 successfully trains RL agents capable of simultaneously optimizing multiple circuits, having different topologies, to achieve target performance levels while prior RL-based methods are unable to do.

The process model’s linear approximation is derived through system identification based on experimental data from a high-fidelity digital twin of the actual process.

The system repeatedly detects environmental changes and reconstructs the recognized objects for use in both virtual and physical spaces. The proposed architecture addresses the need for a perception approach capable of understanding its environment, which is critical to ensuring flexibility and safety in industrial settings.

The origin and propagation mechanism of induced modulation ripple are analyzed, and a ripple suppression model is established, consisting of a ripple source model and a ripple transfer model. These models guide the design of circuit parameters to suppress induced modulation ripple effectively. Experimental results confirm the performance of the proposed transformer, demonstrating a measured output ripple as low as 0.77 μA.

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in smart manufacturing, necessitates intent-driven edge intelligence to provide highly reliable, low-latency computational services for a vast array of connected devices. However, inherent challenges such as the limited computational capacity of IoT devices and unpredictable wireless channels hinder the development of such networks. To address these obstacles, this paper presents an intent-driven optimization framework that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and wireless power transfer (WPT) into an IoT edge computing architecture. Following the principles of intent-based networking (IBN), our framework targets binary task offloading for energy-constrained devices by translating the specific high-level intent of maximizing the total computational rate into a concrete system-level objective. We formulate this objective as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and propose a Deep Reinforcement Integrated Optimization (DRIO) framework to solve it under dynamic network conditions. DRIO effectively decouples the high-dimensional action space, employing a double deep Q-network for coarse RIS phase control, a combination of gradient search and element-wise local search for fine-tuning RIS phases, and a dedicated deep reinforcement learning component for managing binary offloading decisions. Simulation results confirm that DRIO surpasses traditional and standard reinforcement learning methods by successfully fulfilling the intent of maximizing computational rate, showing adaptability to dynamic environments and energy harvesting fluctuations. This study enhances IBN for industrial IoT through AI-powered resource allocation, thereby boosting scalability and efficiency in next-generation communications."

    "abstract": "Driven by AI training, the power consumption and current required by HPC processors are increasing. This is causing changes in the power supply architecture and current delivery structure of HPC processors. The existing LLC DCX design based on LPD structure has only one-dimensional scalability and has not considered integrating the output terminals into the transformer, which will be detrimental to its application in the future VPD. In this paper, a planar transformer integration design with 2-dimensional scalability for vertical power delivery to HPC processors is proposed. A VPD structure is firstly introduced to explain the necessity of the proposed matrix transformer integration design approach. Then, it is demonstrated how to integrate the output terminals into the transformer and realize the two-dimensional seamless expansion of the transformer, which facilitates its application in the VPD structure and is compatible with the LPD design. A transformer design example and its footprint and loss optimization are also conducted. Finally, an 810W prototype was built and tested, achieving a peak efficiency of 94.4% and a transformer power density of 1660W/in<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>, which has a higher power density compared with the existing state-of-art DCX designs."

The proposed antenna design employs a multi-layer dielectric substrate and an upper dielectric layer consists of 4x4 periodic PRS unit cells to form a Fabry-Pérot-like cavity to achieve enhanced antenna parameters. The multi-layer structure consists of an FR4-PETG-FR4 sandwich model. The middle layer is printed by employing a 3D printer using PETG filament. The antenna structure is designed to operate within the 2.4 GHz ISM band offering enhanced bandwidth, directional radiation and gain. Simulation results indicate that the antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 23.45% and a maximum gain of 10.1 dBi at 2.45 GHz operating frequency. To validate the design, a prototype is manufactured and measured. The measurement results show good agreement with the simulation results in terms of both return loss and radiation performance. The produced prototype has 18.45% impedance bandwidth at 2.36 GHz center frequency within the ISM band. Due to its compact size, low cost and ease of fabrication, the proposed design can be integrated into different types of wireless communication systems."

A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 50 second-year medical students from a private university in Arequipa, randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. The experimental group participated in three 90-minute sessions over two weeks, using Hi5 Noitom 2.0 gloves and VR platforms (Hand Physics Lab and VR Surgery Simulator) to perform tasks such as suturing, forceps manipulation, and anatomical palpation. Three validated instruments were employed, a psychomotor rubric, a self-assessment questionnaire, and an observation checklist, all demonstrating strong reliability (α = 0.83–0.88). Statistical analyses (independent samples t-tests, ANCOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA) revealed significant improvements (p < 0.001) in movement precision, visuomotor coordination, technical sequencing, execution time, safety, and feedback in the experimental group, supported by large effect sizes (η² up to 0.86). Students also reported higher confidence and motivation, reflecting both objective and perceived benefits. Under controlled exploratory conditions, these findings suggest that haptic-feedback VR environments can foster realistic, safe, and engaging learning experiences that support the development of psychomotor competencies. The study highlights the pedagogical promise of immersive simulation as a complementary tool to traditional instruction and recommends future longitudinal and multi-site research to validate and generalize the results."

    "abstract": "Most tissue optical spectroscopy platforms use a fiber probe for light delivery and collection, while the inconsistent probe-sample contact could induce significant distortions in the measured optical signals, which consequently bring analysis errors. Moreover, it will be practically difficult to use a fiber probe for measurements in some cases such as oral cancer investigations using small animal models. To address the critical challenge, we report a portable, lens-based, optical spectroscopy device capable of quantifying key vascular and metabolic parameters in vivo without probe-sample contact. We combined lenses based diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy into one portable platform to enable multi-parametric functional characterizations of orthotopic tongue cancer models in vivo. We also implemented easy-to-use spectroscopic algorithms with the system for rapid quantification of the key metabolic and vascular parameters on biological tissue models. We then demonstrated our non-contact optical spectroscopy on tissue-mimicking phantoms and in vivo mouse tongue tumor models. Our phantom and in vivo animal studies showed that our non-contact optical spectroscopy, along with spectroscopic algorithms, could quantify the major metabolic and vascular parameters on in vivo tongue tumors with high accuracy. We also captured the diverse metabolic and vascular phenotypes of tongue tumors with different radiation sensitivity. Our new optical spectroscopy implemented with easy-to-use spectroscopic algorithms will provide a non-contact way for rapid and systematic characterizations of biological tissue metabolism and vascular microenvironment in vivo, which may significantly advance head and neck cancer research in the future."

    "abstract": "The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), particularly for chip placement, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. While existing machine learning (ML)-based approaches have achieved notable progress, they predominantly focus on generating optimal layouts in a single attempt, often producing solutions that require subsequent refinement. To address this limitation, we propose RollPlace, a novel and generalized macro placement framework. RollPlace adopts a two-stage optimization strategy: generating initial placement solutions via machine learning methods or heuristic-based strategies, and refining these layouts efficiently by adjusting specific macros derived from the initial stage. This strategy circumvents the sequential generation constraints inherent in traditional RL-based placement methods. Furthermore, RollPlace seamlessly integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to balance exploration and exploitation, and employs a rollout mechanism for efficient local search. Extensive experiments on the ISPD 2005 benchmark demonstrate that RollPlace outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, end-to-end experimental results based on OpenROAD across 19 benchmarks show that RollPlace excels in multiple metrics. The proposed framework offers a robust and scalable solution for addressing the growing complexity of modern chip design challenges."

    "abstract": "Hyspectral images (HSIs) are inevitably degraded by a mixture of different types of noise, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, stripes, and deadlines. Traditional methods exploit the global low-rankness and local smoothness by using two separate regularization terms for HSI denoising, which may be highly affected by the trade-off parameters between the two regularizers. In this paper, we propose to utilize the three directional tensor correlated total variation (3DTCTV) to explore the global low-rankness and local smoothness of HSIs simultaneously. More specifically, the three directional transformed tensor nuclear norm is employed to the gradient domain of the underlying HSIs along the spatial and spectral dimensions. And the tensor ℓ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> norm is used to characterize the sparsity of the noisy tensor. Moreover, a nonconvex approach is proposed to characterize the low-rankness of the underlying HSIs and enhance the sparsity of noisy tensor further for HSI denoising, where a family of nonconvex functions are employed onto the singular values of the three directional gradient tensors along spatial-spectral dimensions in the transformed domain and each entry of the sparse tensor, respectively. An alternating direction method of multipliers is developed to solve the resulting models and its convergence for the nonconvex model is established under some conditions. Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform various state-of-the-art methods both visually and quantitatively."

    "abstract": "Broad learning system (BLS), as an innovative type of neural network, has demonstrated exceptional performance in regression tasks. Nonetheless, the majority of BLS methods, which rely on the least squares criterion, are highly sensitive to outliers and noisy data, resulting in reduced prediction accuracy. To improve the robustness of broad networks, a sparse Bayesian BLS via adaptive Lasso priors (AL-SBBLS) is proposed in this article to handle regression tasks with data contaminated by outliers and noise. Specifically, adaptive Lasso constraints are first applied to enhance the adaptive sparsity of output weights, which facilitates the automatic selection of highly correlated features. Subsequently, a multilayer Bayesian framework is constructed to provide an adaptive Lasso prior to the output weights, allowing the model for the adaptive learning of regularization factors and the estimation of probability distributions for output values, while further sparsifying the network. By selecting highly correlated features and estimating the probability distributions of output values, the impact of outliers and noise can be effectively mitigated. To effectively train the networks, corresponding optimization algorithms are designed for AL-SBLS and AL-SBBLS using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) and variational Bayesian inference methods, respectively. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods are validated through robust regression experiments on 14 real-world datasets and complex nonlinear data. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed AL-SBBLS achieves the best performance on most datasets, attaining the lowest average ranking of 1.44 in Friedman tests compared with 11 state-of-the-art BLS variants, which confirms its superior predictive accuracy and robustness. The resource code of AL-SBBLS proposed in this article is available at: <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/taocheny/AL-SBBLS</uri>"

However, challenges persist in accurately estimating multiple soil properties simultaneously while handling high-dimensional spectral inputs. Hence, this letter proposes a novel multi-target learning framework—CAT-MTLNet (Concrete Autoencoder and Transformer-based Multi-Target Learning Network) to address these issues.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for high-precision navigation applications, traditional real-time kinematic (RTK) algorithm faces the problems of low ambiguity fixation rate and large error fluctuation in dynamic environment. In order to improve the accuracy and reliability of positioning algorithms, this paper proposes a covariance-driven ambiguity subset preference and adaptive threshold partial ambiguity resolution (CDAT-PAR) algorithm to address the low quality ambiguity interference problem in the ambiguity fixation process. To improve the success rate of ambiguity fixation, the covariance matrix factor is used to divide the quality of the ambiguity subsets, sort and select the ambiguity subsets that satisfy the low correlation, and establish new integer ambiguities and covariance matrices. In order to prevent incorrect ambiguity fixation, the ambiguity fixation threshold is optimized by constructing carrier motion state features and applying a polynomial coefficient algorithm. By integrating the two strategies, a complete set of ambiguity screening-fixation-verification optimization schemes is formed, and more robust relative positioning results are obtained. This paper carried out static, low-dynamics vehicle, and general aviation aircraft relative positioning experiments respectively. The experimental results show that in different experimental environment, the positioning accuracy of CDAT-PAR is improved by 26.40%, 27.78% and 59.46% compared with the RTKLIB algorithm, and the fixation rate is improved to 99.64%, 87.11% and 92.02%, and the dynamic positioning accuracy is improved to the decimeter level. The proposed algorithm effectively improves the ambiguity fixation success rate and positioning accuracy in dynamic environment, especially in environment with weak satellite geometry or poor signal quality."

    "abstract": "In recent years, more and more people have suffered from financial fraud, with the majority occurring in financial transactions. However, identifying fraudulent transactions is not an easy task for financial institutions because they have a small sample of fraud and are subject to interference from some untrue, malicious data. Moreover, in order to protect the privacy of user transactions, data between financial institutions is generally not shared, making it very difficult to train a suitable model. In order to address the issue of privacy protection regarding transaction data of financial institutions, we adopted the method of federated learning to construct the model. However, traditional federated learning can greatly reduce the stability of transaction detection under attacks from malicious data. Therefore, we choose to combine an enhanced clustering selection algorithm (ECS) with federated learning to improve the robustness of the model. Meanwhile, due to the non-sharing of data during federated training, the accuracy of the model may decrease. So, we chose to introduce meta learning as a clustering algorithm, which is called federated meta learning, along with federated learning, to improve the accuracy of our model. To test the effectiveness of the model, we conducted horizontal and vertical comparative experiments. Horizontally compare our model with other ordinary models to explore the accuracy of our model, and vertically set different proportions of malicious data attack intensity to explore the stability of our model. The experimental results show that our model combines ordinary federated learning with ECS algorithm and meta learning, demonstrating significant advantages in dealing with data imbalance and malicious interference."

    "abstract": "The rising cost and complexity of cutting-edge process nodes have impeded large monolithic System-on-Chip to follow Moore’s Law, forcing chip designers to embrace Multi-Chiplet architectures. Multi-chiplet designs achieve cost reduction while maintaining near-monolithic performance by disaggregating a large die into smaller chiplets and integrating them through advanced packaging. The payback of this Disaggregation-Integration paradigm critically depends on the efficacy of chiplet Partition and Placement framework. However, existing frameworks fail to harness the potential merits offered by Partition-Placement Co-Optimization. Serving as an input provider for placement, partition phase typically adjusts block-to-die assignments to guide subsequent placement. This sequential dependency implies an inherent Partition-Placement (P2P) Inconsistency problem: solutions optimal solely in partition or placement may finally cause an inferior solution. Hence, this paper proposes P2P-Chiplet, a Partition-Placement Co-Optimization framework for multi-chiplet designs. Firstly, an optimized ACG structure, named as HeteroACG, is introduced to aggregate topological partition and physical placement optimization spaces. Then, the sequential partition-placement flow is decomposed into interleaved fine-grained epochs and an alternating progressive optimization strategy is employed to preserve P2P Consistency and bring better co-optimized solutions. Finally, experimental results show that, compared with existing chiplet partition-placement frameworks, our proposed P2P Chiplet notably mitigates potential performance bottlenecks while effectively reducing costs within acceptable overhead."

For the first time, we identify required key components towards enabling AI-based topology-agnostic design knowledge transfer and demonstrate how such methodology can be developed for analog sizing optimization utilizing large language models (LLMs). The proposed framework, called Analog Design Optimization with Knowledge Transfer (ADO-KT) consists of three key integrated steps: 1) LLM-enabled knowledge graph (KG) generation for structured extraction of prior analog design knowledge, 2) LLM-enabled knowledge graph refinement for quality KG generation, and 3) topology-agnostic knowledge transfer for LLM-assisted optimization of new circuits. ADO-KT enables seamless summarization and transfer of quality knowledge flow between circuits of varying types and topologies, effectively mirroring human designers’ strategies. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in design quality and data efficiency, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for automated analog circuit design with generalized knowledge reuse."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have demonstrated superior performance in various fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. However, their enormous model size and high demands in computation, memory, and communication limit their deployment to edge platforms for local, secure inference. Binary transformers offer a compact, low-complexity solution for edge deployment with reduced bandwidth needs and acceptable accuracy. However, existing binary transformers perform inefficiently on current hardware due to the lack of binary specific optimizations. To address this, we introduce COBRA, an algorithm-architecture co-optimized binary Transformer accelerator for edge computing. COBRA features a real 1-bit binary multiplication unit, enabling matrix operations with -1, 0, and +1 values, surpassing ternary methods. With further hardware-friendly optimizations in the attention block, COBRA achieves up to 3,894.7 GOPS throughput and 448.7 GOPS/Watt energy efficiency on edge FPGAs, delivering a 311× energy efficiency improvement over GPUs and a 3.5× throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art binary accelerator, with only negligible inference accuracy degradation."

Within this solver’s algorithm, the idea of the augmented Lagrangian with a penalty parameter- a parameter which captures the relative weight-age on the objective function and the constraints of the problem in-hand- is utilized to develop an algorithm with so-called augmentation parameters. Although, the selection of these parameters is a crucial task, the optimal way to do the selection is not yet known. This work proposes a new method to select these parameters by utilizing the information of the conjugate directions of the coefficient matrix of a linear system of equations present in the algorithm. This selection makes it possible to cache these conjugate directions, instead of computing them at each iteration, resulting in a faster computation of the solution of the linear system, thus reducing the overall computation time. This reduction is demonstrated by a numerical example by comparing the total time it takes for the algorithms to converge sufficiently close to the optimal solution."

Therefore, accurate modeling of these non-idealities becomes significant. In this work, we present PDGM-IMC, the first physics and data co-driven generative framework for IMC non-idealities characterizing. Unlike traditional physical models that fail to model complex non-ideality behaviors, or black-box neural networks that lack interpretability and generalization, PDGM-IMC leverages normalizing flows with custom transformations directly derived from device physics principles. This novel approach enables explicit modeling of complex probability distributions, spatial correlations, and die-to-die variations that previous methods could not capture. Validated on multiple dies of a commercial eFlash-based IMC SoC, PDGM-IMC improves modeling accuracy by 4.6× for the input circuit and IMC array and by 2.0× for the output circuit, significantly outperforming existing approaches. By extracting the statistical signature of fabricated chips, PDGM-IMC enables accurate pre-silicon prediction of post-silicon behavior, fundamentally transforming hardware-aware neural network optimization for analog accelerators.

The major bottleneck of compound AI lies in frequent data movement due to the massive parameters and dynamic routing mechanisms. Compute-In-Memory (CiM) has demonstrated great potential to mitigate the memory wall. However, constrained by the rigid array structure, existing CiM accelerators struggle to meet more general and diverse model compression demands of compound AI, such as fine-grained pruning for expert models and outlier-aware quantization for LLM-based router models. The lack of support for agile model compression hinders the deployment of compound AI systems on CiM accelerators.To fully unlock the potential of CiM in accelerating compound AI, we present DANCE, a dual-side N:M sparse compressed digital CiM architecture with cross-layer co-optimizations: (i) At the circuit level, DANCE introduces a customized set-associative selection circuit to extract N:M sparse patterns for both weights and activations, maintaining high parallelism; (ii) At the architecture level, DANCE explores a novel design paradigm that integrates fine-grained pruning and outlier-aware quantization into a unified N:M sparsity compression framework. Experimental results show that DANCE achieves up to 4.36× energy efficiency improvement with <1% accuracy loss for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-100, and up to 2.59× energy efficiency improvement with <0.5 perplexity increase for Llama-7B on WikiText-2, compared to the conventional digital CiM baseline."

FPGA-based SmartNICs excel due to their programmability at hardware speed, enabling high-performance and customized offloading. Securing offloaded network functions on FPGA-based SmartNICs is a critical challenge in the cloud, as the sensitive user cannot fully trust the cloud service provider (CSP). CPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) protect software code, not FPGA hardware circuits. Existing FPGA TEEs fail to provide packet I/O protection, System-on-Chip (SoC) CPU utilization, and user-friendly memory access interfaces. To address this gap, we introduce SNO, the first TEE for FPGA-based SmartNICs with the secure boot, the SNO Manager for attestation and network function lifecycle orchestration, and the SNO Guard for I/O encryption and authentication. SNO increases SoC CPU utilization (+6.6% for 8-CPU SoC) by co-locating the SNO Manager with the CSP software while isolating the security-critical components of SNO Manager inside SoC CPU TEE, reduces performance overhead by integrating a fully-pipelined AES-GCM engine and overlapped execution, and offers a user-friendly (86.9% user code reduction) streaming interface. The experimental results show that SNO introduces a relative latency overhead of 7.7–143.2% (corresponding to absolute overheads up to 96 nanoseconds) across five network functions, significantly offset by microsecond-level latency savings from offloading."

However, the deterministic nature of the existing models fail to account for the spatial and temporal variability in the semiconductor supply chain. The absence of uncertainty modeling limits system designers’ ability to make informed, carbon-aware decisions. We introduce CarbonClarity, a probabilistic framework designed to model embodied carbon footprints through distributions that reflect uncertainties in energy-per-area, gas-per-area, yield, and carbon intensity across different technology nodes. Our framework enables a deeper understanding of how design choices, such as chiplet architectures and new vs. old technology node selection, impact emissions and their associated uncertainties. For example, we show that the gap between the mean and 95<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> percentile of embodied carbon per cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> can reach up to 1.6× for the 7nm technology node. Additionally, we demonstrate through case studies that: (i) CarbonClarity is a valuable resource for device provisioning, help maintaining performance under a tight carbon budget; and (ii) chiplet technology and mature nodes not only reduce embodied carbon but also significantly lower its associated uncertainty, achieving an 18% reduction in the 95<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> percentile compared to monolithic designs for the mobile application."

    "abstract": "Transpilation, particularly noise-aware optimization, is widely regarded as essential for maximizing the performance of quantum circuits on superconducting quantum computers. The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16 diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights: (1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing fidelity – offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows."

As its autoregressive generation process remains memory-bound, speculative decoding has been proposed that incorporates draft model generation and target model verification. However, directly applying speculative decoding to SSMs faces three key challenges: (1) hidden state backtracking difficulties, (2) tree-based parallel verification incompatibility, and (3) hardware workload mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose SpecMamba, the first FPGA-based accelerator for Mamba with speculative decoding, which features system, algorithm, and hardware co-design. At the system level, we present a memory-aware hybrid backtracking strategy to coordinate both models. At the algorithm level, we propose first-in-first-out (FIFO)-based tree verification with tiling to minimize memory access. At the hardware level, we customize a dataflow that computes linear layers in parallel and SSM layers in series to enable maximal overlapping. Implemented on AMD FPGA platforms (VHK158 and VCK190), SpecMamba achieves a 2.27× speedup over GPU baselines and a 2.85× improvement compared to prior FPGA solutions, while demonstrating 5.41× and 1.26× higher energy efficiency, respectively."

Given that CNN accelerators are already widely adopted commercially, this paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging existing CNN accelerators to handle NLP workloads—particularly decoder-only language models—thus avoiding the high cost of developing dedicated NLP hardware. However, direct use of CNN accelerators for language model poses several challenges due to the distinct characteristics of this network. These include non-computational operations in attention layers, such as head merging/splitting and tensor transpositions, as well as the need for floating point precision in nonlinear operations such as Softmax and RMSNorm, which CNN accelerators typically do not support. Furthermore, inference throughput drops significantly during the generation phase due to memory-bound operations, in contrast to the compute-bound nature of convolution. To address these challenges, we propose a set of minimal hardware extensions to existing CNN accelerators to enable efficient decoder-only Transformer inference. We propose a method to execute multi-head attention layers without relying on dedicated reshaping hardware and augment the architecture with a lightweight SIMD coprocessor to handle non-linear operations. Additionally, we present techniques to improve power efficiency during the generation stage. Our experimental results demonstrate that even low-power CNN accelerators can achieve NLP inference throughput comparable to GPUs, opening a promising path toward versatile and cost-effective embedded AI hardware."

Conversely, ZK-friendly hashes are designed for circuit efficiency but struggle on conventional hardware, often orders of magnitude slower than standard hashes due to their reliance on expensive finite field arithmetic. To bridge this performance gap, we present HashEmAll, a novel collection of FPGA-based realizations for three prominent ZK-friendly hashes: Griffin, Rescue-Prime, and Reinforced Concrete. Each offers distinct optimization pro les, with both area-optimized and latency-optimized variants available, allowing users to tailor hardware selection to specific application constraints regarding resource utilization and performance.Our extensive evaluation shows that latency-optimized HashEmAll designs outperform CPU implementations by at least 10×, with the leading design achieving a 23× speedup. These gains are coupled with lower power consumption and compatibility with accessible FPGAs. Importantly, the highly parallel and pipelined architecture of HashEmAll enables significantly better practical scaling than CPU-based approaches towards building real-world ZKP applications, such as data commitments with Merkle Trees, by mitigating the hashing bottleneck for large trees. This highlights the suitability of HashEmAll for real-world ZKP applications involving large-scale data authentication.

    "abstract": "A precise understanding of the manipulator model is essential for effective tracking control in robotic applications. Once the kinematic model of the manipulator is unavailable, the application of model-based methods may result in the inability to successfully accomplish a desired task. To this end, a hybrid learning control framework is proposed to enhance model accuracy and trajectory tracking performance, which integrates gradient fuzzy neural dynamics (GFND) with a varying-parameter predefined-time convergence term. With the aid of GFND, the Jacobian matrix of the manipulator is accurately estimated, and fuzzy logic systems are adopted to adaptively tune the learning rate. The incorporation of a predefined-time framework ensures that robotic control tasks are completed within a specified duration, regardless of the initial system states. To ensure adherence to joint constraints in practical settings, a nonlinear mapping function is designed, which in turn enhances the manipulator’s ability to accomplish designated control objectives. The proposed algorithm is proven to converge through comprehensive theoretical analyses, while its feasibility and advantages are demonstrated through simulation and experiment on a manipulator."

    "abstract": "Due to the low efficiency of manual inspection of pointer pressure gauges, numerous computer vision-based automatic reading recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. However, most existing work primarily focuses on using cameras or inspection robots for daily monitoring of gauges. Periodic calibration of gauges is equally important, as it ensures their optimal performance and imposes stricter precision requirements on inspections. To address these challenges, this study proposes a lightweight multitask interactive network (LMI-Net) and develops an intelligent robotic-assisted measurement system. LMI-Net, which generates a large number of feature maps through computationally inexpensive operation of a lightweight module, realizes multiple tasks via keypoint detection and instance segmentation branches. The keypoint detection branch identifies the position of the main scale and the center of the gauge, while the instance segmentation branch generates a segmentation mask of the pointer. Through our proposed multiple feature fusion (MFF) reading method, the value and order of the main scale are identified, the segmentation mask of the pointer is fitted to a straight line using a regional interpolation linear fitting method, and on the basis of geometric relationships, these pieces of feature information are fused to obtain a reading. Experimental results on a dataset containing multiple types of gauge demonstrate that with the proposed method, the reading error is controlled to within ±1/5 of the minimum resolution interval, which complies with the verification regulation for pointer pressure gauges."

However, existing efforts mainly focus on image quality, often overlooking a key point: the diffusion model represents a data distribution, not individual images. This introduces a low but critical chance of generating images that contradict user intentions, raising ethical concerns. For example, a user inputting a stroke painting with female characteristics might, with some probability, get male faces from SDEdit. To expose this potential vulnerability, we propose the Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA), whose objective is to force SDEdit to generate data distributions aligned with a specified attribute (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.,</i> targeted attribute like male), without changing the attribute of the input image. Empirical studies reveal that traditional adversarial noise struggles to achieve TAGA, while natural perturbations such as exposure and motion blur can easily influence attributes of the generated images. Inspired by the observation, we design attack method <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FOOLSDEDIT</small> to achieve effective TAGA against SDEdit. It aims to search for an optimized strategy to execute attacks within a weighted graph-based attack architecture, which is formulated to model diverse strategies derived from both exposure and motion blur perturbations. Comprehensive experiments on two commonly used datasets and three social attributes present that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FOOLSDEDIT</small> forces SDEdit to generate targeted attribute-aware distributions, achieving significantly more effective TAGA than the baselines. We also validated empirically that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FOOLSDEDIT</small> could induce bias in downstream tasks of SDEdit which rely on the generated data under attack. Our work reveals critical vulnerabilities in diffusion-based image generation models and paves the way for future research on model auditing and bias mitigation."

    "abstract": "Current studies struggle to achieve multiobjective optimization for overactuated electric vehicles. This article proposes a cohesive hierarchical architecture that integrates coordinated control with velocity optimization, enabling tracking of desired planar motions while ensuring ride comfort and energy efficiency. First, a velocity optimization strategy based on the deep deterministic policy gradient is developed to achieve comfortable and energy-efficient driving. Desired vehicle states are generated by a reference model. The stability of the coordinated control is then formulated as a tracking problem for these desired vehicle states. To account for parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, a port-Hamiltonian model is employed to describe nonlinear planar motions incorporating four-wheel dynamics of overactuated electric vehicles. A robust passivity-based control method with guaranteed stability is developed using this model to track the desired vehicle states. Furthermore, to reduce sensor costs and improve measurement reliability, a real-time nonlinear observer is designed to accurately estimate lateral velocity. The stability of the overall system is analyzed considering estimation errors. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing approaches across various driving scenarios."

To validate the feasibility of the PPE driving scheme, an analog pulsewidth modulation (A-PWM) pixel circuit was designed and fabricated using a-IGZO thin-film transistors (TFTs). The fabricated pixel circuit demonstrates a reliable PPE operation, and maintains a low driving current error rate below 2%, even under a TFT threshold voltage variation of ±3 V."

    "abstract": "Silicon photonics holds considerable promise for reducing long reach communication overheads in future computing systems. Similarly, waferscale integration promises dramatic improvements in performance and energy efficiency for scale out systems, but suffers from the long reach limitations of electrical interconnects. No prior work has looked at the performance benefits of silicon photonics over electrical interconnects to address the long reach challenges of waferscale integration, or at the overheads of silicon photonics for such systems across multiple implementations. In this work, we study a tile-based silicon photonics waferscale system for different implementations of waveguide networks and topologies, and across multiple applications and number of tiles. We find that the performance benefits of using silicon photonics instead of electrical interconnects at waferscale are highly application-dependent - benefits primarily come from reduced communication latency. The power and area overheads of implementation are high, especially for high connectivity topologies and when reconfigurability is considered. Some implementations are infeasible - the microring resonator maximum power limits are exceeded for these implementations. Custom waveguide networks address the problem and limit the overheads when supporting high connectivity topologies and reconfigurability. Overall, this is the first paper to analyze the performance benefits of silicon photonics vs electrical interconnects at waferscale and optimize the implementation overheads of waferscale silicon photonics systems."

However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6% and 12.7%, and saves at maximum 86% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly applied across various domains, including social media and recommendation systems. However, data privacy protection has become a critical issue for GNN applications. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which enables computation on encrypted data, has emerged as a mainstream solution for secure GNN inference. However, due to the high computational costs of FHE-based GNNs, dedicated accelerators are necessary to make them practical. Existing CKKS-based GNN algorithms require large encryption parameters, imposing high demands on hardware resources. The state-of-the-art design PPGNN is hardware friendly on memory by combining CKKS with TFHE, but TFHE’s SISD computing characteristic causes a dramatic increase in computational overhead, limiting its performance benefits. This paper proposes a novel software-hardware code-signed GNN accelerator architecture, Uranus, which integrates a hardware-friendly algorithmic framework with a matching accelerator design. The inference framework leverages CKKS and BFV schemes to enable efficient linear layer computations and SIMD-based nonlinear calculations with reduced encryption parameters suitable for hardware constraints. Additionally, the highly reconfigurable hardware accelerator maximizes utilization and performance. Key results demonstrate the following: (1) up to 92× speedup compared to CKKS accelerators; (2) achieves 3.3× to 4.2× performance improvement over the SOTA PPGNN architecture; (3) over 119× in energy efficiency improvement compared to PPGNN."

The coarse-grained models first predict the electrical potential and temperature distributions of the entire circuit under various boundary conditions, while the fine-grained models provide enhanced resolution for regions of interest.

Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy with 0.10-0.19% mean relative error and 3-4 orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency compared to the commercial tool."

    "abstract": "To achieve a successful microwave ablation of breast tumors, the determination of ablation settings via treatment planning is a critical step. These settings include the position of the microwave applicator, which depends on the skill and experience of the specialist. In this work, we introduce a morphology-driven planning strategy by using twenty-two digital models from a public breast tumor patient model repository. The proposed strategy extracts four candidate antenna positions along the three principal axes of each segmented tumor via principal components analysis (PCA) and then an additional one by using a differential evolution optimizer. For each candidate position, an equivalent volume ablation zone simulated for a micro-coaxial antenna was overlapped on the tumor, and three metrics were computed: non-ablated tumor volume percentage, ablated tumor volume percentage, and collateral damage percentage. By selecting the largest PCA axis, non-ablated tumor volume decreased by 4.6%–7.7%, ablated tumor increased by 4.6%–7.7%, and collateral damage decreased by 2.9%–7.0% compared to the other axes. Further refinement with the differential evolution algorithm yielded additional improvements of 5.98%, 5.95%, and 5.35% in these metrics, respectively, compared to PCA-based placement (paired t-test, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> = 0.0027 for non-ablated tumor volume; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> = 0.0028 for ablated tumor volume; <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> = 0.0015 for collateral damage).

It provides a quantitative, reproducible criterion for antenna placement to minimize the reliance on specialist skill and improve clinical outcomes in microwave ablation of breast tumors."

We investigate a feedback linearizing control approach with a lumostatic setpoint, which adjusts the dilution rate to maintain, at each time step, the biomass concentration that yields maximum productivity. To achieve this, we employ established radiative and kinetic models for Chlorella vulgaris from the literature. The radiative model describes light attenuation in the culture, while the kinetic model provides the growth rate for a given light intensity. The control strategy was tuned and tested using several idealized light profiles. We then evaluated the biomass productivity over an entire year of solar data and compared the results with those from a simple open-loop operation and a more complex model predictive control (MPC) strategy. The proposed lumostatic operation, under ideal conditions and with proper tuning, achieved production levels approaching those of the more complex strategies."

Utilizing a two-layer model of a semi-infinite horizontally-layered medium, the study explores the influences of skin, subcutaneous fat, and muscle activity on electrical impedance signals. This model allows describing the effects of internal and external compression of the electrode system by changing the thickness of the skin-adipose layer. As result the behavior of bioimpedance signals during muscle contraction is better described by a two-layered semi-infinite model, emphasizing the importance of considering more complex models for an adequate inverse electrical impedance problem solution. Changes in the resistance by blood flow and respiration can be disregarded. The results of the studies provide an idea of the mechanisms of forearm EIM signal formation during muscle contraction for prostheses or human-machine interfaces."

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injuries continue to pose significant challenges in modern surgical practices. Current neurostimulation devices rely on wired power supply systems. To reduce invasiveness and postoperative complications from wire leads, wireless stimulation was implemented, eliminating percutaneous connections while preserving therapeutic efficacy. To enhance the regenerative processes of nerve tissue, a specialized cuff device providing optoelectronic stimulation through organic semiconductors has been developed. This wireless device is activated by external light pulses at a wavelength of $\\mathbf{6 2 5 ~ n m}$. Its design incorporates a gold electrode and a semiconductor pixel (H2Pc/PTCDI), which are responsible for generating the stimulation signals. These materials were selected due to their high efficiency and biocompatibility. The device generates up to 250 mV, sufficient to trigger action potentials in cells. Experimental results demonstrated substantial stimulation effects on the surfaces of the organic semiconductor, with Neuro2A cell cultures exhibiting a 2.61-fold increase in population density and mpf cell cultures showing a $\\mathbf{1 . 5 7}$-fold increase compared to the control groups. In vivo experiments were conducted on the sciatic nerve of rats, with daily stimulation over a three-month period. The implant demonstrated immunological inertness, absence of local tissue damage.To quantitatively assess the extent of nerve regeneration, nerve latency was measured. Stimulation led to a significant reduction in latency when compared to the control group, which did not receive stimulation. The results obtained confirm that the developed cuff effectively accelerates the regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves, improving functional recovery and reducing the overall recovery time."

    "abstract": "Chart corpora, which comprise data visualizations and their semantic labels, are crucial for advancing visualization research. However, the labels in most existing corpora are high-level (e.g., chart types), hindering their utility for broader applications in the era of AI. In this paper, we contribute VISANATOMY, a corpus containing 942 real-world SVG charts produced by over 50 tools, encompassing 40 chart types and featuring structural and stylistic design variations. Each chart is augmented with multi-level fine-grained labels on its semantic components, including each graphical element's type, role, and position, hierarchical groupings of elements, group layouts, and visual encodings. In total, VISANATOMY provides labels for more than 383k graphical elements. We demonstrate the richness of the semantic labels by comparing VISANATOMY with existing corpora. We illustrate its usefulness through four applications: semantic role inference for SVG elements, chart semantic decomposition, chart type classification, and content navigation for accessibility. Finally, we discuss research opportunities to further improve VISANATOMY."

    "abstract": "As vias become narrower and deeper, to improve semiconductor performance, the demand for tungsten (W) with excellent step coverage is increasing. However, residual stress remains an important issue in the W thin film deposition process. This study investigated the residual stress of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) W thin films using two different reducing gases: diborane (B<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sub>) and silane (SiH<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>). Residual stress was quantitatively evaluated using the Stoney equation based-on wafer curvature measurements. As a result, the SiH<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>-W thin film exhibited higher residual stress than the B<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>H<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sub>-W film as the thin film thickness increased. It was found that the difference in residual stress depending on the reducing gas was mainly attributed to microstructural effects rather than impurity incorporation. In both cases, the intrinsic stress was dominant in the residual stress.

In this paper, we propose a unified motion planning framework for mobile manipulators. It consists of two parts: a sampling-based path planner with feasibility-aware focus regions for efficient path generation, and a WA-QN optimizer that adaptively filters and aggregates curvature information to enhance convergence in high-dimensional spaces. Comprehensive experiments in simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves faster planning, higher success rates, and superior path and trajectory quality, while exhibiting strong generalization across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "Accurate state-of-charge (soc) estimation of lithium-ion batteries is crucial, and whether the battery model parameters can be accurately identified will directly affect the results of soc estimation. In the field of soc estimation, recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm with a single forgetting factor is commonly used for battery parameter identification, which relies on defaulting to the same change rate for each battery parameter, whereas the change rate of each parameter is different during actual operation. After the model conversion in this paper, the input-output mapping contains three parameters with different change rates that need to be identified, therefore, a new method for parameter identification by three adaptive forgetting factors RLS is proposed, matching the three forgetting factors for three parameters with different change rates. To cope with the changing characteristics of the parameters, an adaptive strategy is proposed for adjusting values of forgetting factors, based on updating according to estimation error, the effects of influencing factors like soc are extended into the adaptive framework in the way of a function. Convergence analysis is provided, which can prove that the proposed algorithm can converge asymptotically with bounded error. Accurate soc estimation is further achieved using the noise adaptive Kalman filter algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of proposed method, experiments are conducted under different operating conditions, temperatures and aged batteries, whose results show that the proposed method can estimate the soc with an absolute error of less than 0.2%."

    "abstract": "The rise of multisection continuum robots (CRs) has captivated researchers and practitioners across diverse industries and medical fields. Researchers have devised a spectrum of model-based and learning-based strategies to conquer the modeling problem and elevate control performance. Despite the advancements in these approaches, they encounter challenges stemming from their complex design and intricate learning processes. This article introduces a simply structured, model-free fuzzy logic controller (FLC) for the closed-loop control of continuum robots. This controller boasts a built-in shape classification algorithm. This algorithm allows it to achieve robust control using only the feedback of end position and orientation, significantly reducing sensor dependence. It efficiently adapts to various nonlinearities such as hysteresis, cable elongation, and unexpected external disturbances. The experimental results conclusively demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed FLC. On a three-section, six-degree-of-freedom continuum robot, it achieved a minuscule trajectory tracking root mean square error from 0.31 to 1.00 mm, representing just 0.19% to 0.60% of the robot’s length. Additionally, the controller demonstrates robustness by successfully handling unexpected external disturbances during the trajectory tracking."

    "abstract": "In the era of big data, the demand for memory capacity in modern computing systems is surging. The CXL-SSD, NAND Flash-based memory expander using emerging Compute Express Link (CXL), has become a promising solution for efficient memory expansion. However, the memory-expansion scenario poses severe performance and endurance challenges for CXL-SSDs, and existing works fail to fully address them due to the usage of traditional SSDs as back-end media. To optimize these aspects, we propose LsCMM-H, a Total-Cost-of-Ownership (TCO) -efficient CXL-SSD architecture with Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs as back-end media for better latency and lifetime. LsCMM-H employs hardware-software co-designed log management, low-overhead data-tiering-based garbage collection mechanism, and read acceleration to leverage the benefits of ZNS. Based on our evaluation, LsCMM-H reduces tail latency by 49.9%, improves throughput by 41.9%, endurance by 280.5%, and saves TCO by 72.4% compared to vanilla CXL-SSD. The additional comparison also demonstrates the superiority of our proposed log structure."

    "abstract": "As the increasing demands of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) in advanced nodes, the rigid configurations of standard cells impose significant limitations on wirelength and area optimization. A more flexible alternative is to place transistors directly on the design canvas, allowing for precise transistor-level adjustments that reduce wirelength and minimize design area. In this paper, we propose DiSPlace, a novel diffusion-sharing-driven transistor-level placement algorithm beyond standard-cell boundaries to fully leverage DTCO. We first present an in-cell placement based transistor pairing method to pair PMOS and NMOS transistors with the same gate net, followed by incorporating Gaussian perturbations to generate an initial placement. Then, we propose the first diffusion-sharing-driven global placement framework. It begins with the construction of diffusion sharing nets to guide transistor placement, followed by an analytical model for simultaneously optimizing diffusion sharing, wirelength, and density. Besides, a nonlinear optimization with adaptive penalty adjustment is presented to solve the analytical model effectively and efficiently. Finally, we develop a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)-based detailed placement method to optimize design area and wirelength while ensuring legal placement. A diffusion-sharing-aware partitioning technique is also developed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the SMT-based method. Compared to a standard-cell-based placer and the state-of-the-art transistor-level placer, our algorithm achieves significant improvements, reducing wirelength by 18% and 11%, and design area by 24% and 4%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of DiSPlace in achieving high-quality placements for transistor-level designs."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "As technology scales and operating frequencies increase, achieving timing closure in digital circuits has become significantly challenging. Traditional post-placement optimization often fails to account for routing variations, leading to persistent timing violations and lengthy design iterations. To address this issue, we introduce a Spatially Embedded Graph Transformer (SEGT) for accurate timing prediction at the placement stage, considering the effects of subsequent processes. By incorporating distance-aware self-attention and a positional encoding scheme tailored to the geometric structure of circuit designs, SEGT effectively captures complex interactions between non-adjacency nodes and the positional context of circuits. Compared to previous timing prediction networks, SEGT improves the R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score from 0.915 to 0.959 in post-routing stage delay prediction and from 0.857 to 0.938 in post-routing path slack prediction. Leveraging accurate timing predictions of SEGT, a preemptive timing closure framework is developed to handle routing-induced violations proactively before post-placement optimization. Our framework identifies post-routing timing violation paths with slacks and adjusts the required arrival time by precisely the amount needed to clear each violation, thereby reducing additional design overhead. Experimental results of the proposed timing closure enhancement framework with SEGT predictions showed a substantial reduction in total negative slack across test designs while also lowering power and area overhead compared to previous works, demonstrating significant timing improvement and superior design efficiency. By enhancing the accuracy of timing prediction, this work enables a proactive and efficient timing closure approach, bridging the gap between placement and routing stages in physical design."

Reliable operation in such contexts depends on methods that account for environmental complexity, resource limitations, and energy efficiency.

This paper focuses on trajectory generation, a core aspect of autonomous motion planning. BiSpiral is a general-purpose method designed for complete area coverage in convex environments. The proposed approach constructs a spiral-shaped path by leveraging the geometric properties of convex shapes, enabling uniform coverage while minimizing redundancy and optimizing space usage.

    "abstract": "Transient execution attacks can exploit speculative execution to leak sensitive information through cache systems. Consequently, numerous cache-centric secure speculation defenses have been proposed. However, as we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically, these defenses remain vulnerable to data leakage because they neglect or fail to fully address the security issues posed by the hardware prefetcher, a critical component of modern cache systems, within the speculative execution path. In this work, we develop a new attack framework, SpectrePrefetch, which exploits hardware prefetchers as transmission mediums for leaking secrets during speculative execution. Specifically, we introduce two variants of SpectrePrefetch attacks that encode transient secrets into the prefetching patterns and prefetching confidence, respectively, and then recover secrets by probing the cache state or the prefetcher state. We launch SpectrePrefetch to attack several Intel CPUs and a Gem5 simulator, demonstrating its feasibility, robustness, bandwidth, scalability, and security implications on existing defenses. The results show that SpectrePrefetch can leak secrets at a high rate of 31.25 Kbps with an accuracy of 98.87%. More seriously, SpectrePrefetch undermines cache-centric secure speculation defenses or even secure cache designs, and is challenging to mitigate. Our experimental results show that simply restricting the prefetcher to update only on committed instructions, as proposed in MuonTrap, nearly loses all performance benefits provided by hardware prefetching. Finally, we propose a low-cost, scalable non-deterministic prefetching defense against transient execution attacks exploiting hardware prefetchers, while maintaining or even improving average performance on SPEC2017 benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) requires several elliptic-curve-based functions, including elliptic-curve scalar multiplication (ECSM), hashing to the curve, and pairing. Although these computations share underlying similarities, prior hardware designs have shown that distinct architectures yield better performance for each function. Consequently, it remains unclear which architecture offers optimal performance when supporting all required functions within a unified design. In this work, we present a design space exploration methodology in which the design is parameterized using a defined set of design parameters, and an automatic schedule generator is employed to estimate the cycle counts for each function. This allows us to identify the configuration that minimizes latency for both individual functions and complete cryptographic operations. The versatility of our approach is demonstrated through two case studies: 1) ECSM over Curve25519, Secp256k1, NIST-P256, and NIST-P384; and 2) multiple elliptic-curve functions over the BLS12-381 curve. In the first case, the optimal configuration implemented on a Virtex7 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) achieves up to a 15% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art designs. In the second case, the unified accelerator in its optimal configuration supports all core ABE functions and achieves superior latency or throughput-per-area (TPA), and in some cases both, compared to existing designs."

    "abstract": "Digital Twin-as-a-Service (DTaaS) has emerged as a transformative paradigm to deliver modular, scalable, and intelligent digital twin (DT) functionalities. Regarding this, several studies have investigated DT platforms and their enabling technologies. However, their focus mostly remains domain-specific, thereby limiting the potential for generalisation across diverse contexts. Furthermore, these studies lack a systematic framework to address both architectural elements and their performance evaluation required for an end-to-end DTaaS platform. To bridge this gap, in this survey, we present a comprehensive component-based taxonomy for DTaaS platforms, categorised into <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">core</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">supportive</i> components. As the core components, we review Data, Model, Service, and Communication, whereas the supportive components include Infrastructure, Orchestration, and Security elements. For each component, we analyse the state-of-the-art methods, enabling technologies, and associated design trade-offs. We further introduce a metric-driven perspective to design measurable and context-aware DTaaS platforms. In this regard, we present several DT performance metrics, including twinning rate, twin fidelity, and age-of-twin and map them to DTaaS components. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we present a case study based on our own DTaaS platform. We perform two metric-driven implementations, (i) Radio Access Network (RAN) management and (ii) Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection by exemplifying how DT-metrics can be integrated with the DTaaS components. Also, we outline key open issues for context-aware, interoperable, and secure DTaaS platforms. By jointly addressing an end-to-end architectural design and performance metrics, this survey demonstrates a foundational reference for the structured development, evaluation, and operation of DTaaS platforms."

    "abstract": "Recently, many drug-drug interaction prediction (DDIP) models based on graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged. While GNNs have proven effective in DDIP, existing methods face two significant challenges: the homogenization of drug features and the redundancy of drug pair features. Specifically, many drugs exhibit small differences in atomic structure but significant variations in potency. The propagation mechanism of GNN tends to homogenize all drug features within a substructure centered on each drug, leading to confusion in subsequent predictions. Subsequently, the homogenization problem makes it easy to integrate irrelevant features of neighbor drugs into the target node, which seriously threatens the prediction performance. Hence, we propose a Two-stage Graph information maximization model for Drug-drug Interaction Prediction, namely TGDIP. TGDIP mainly consists of two components: drug feature information maximization module and drug pair feature information maximization module. The first component uses contrastive learning with comprehensive graph augmentations and designs mutual information based constraints to ensure the uniqueness of drug features, alleviating the homogenization problem. In the second component, we design Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion based information bottleneck to compress irrelevant information between drug pairs, improving the representation of drug interaction. Multiple experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of TGDIP."

    "abstract": "Speech enhancement (SE) aims to preserve speech components while removing noise that degrades signal quality. However, existing methods often distort speech components by over-suppressing noise. This paper proposes a two-stage SE framework called the suppression and compensation network (SCNet) that estimates high-quality target speech by balancing noise reduction and speech preservation. In the first stage, the noise suppression module (NS-Module) removes major noise components by modeling a complex mask function that estimates both magnitude and phase information. The NS-Module distinguishes speech from noise based on the regular energy distribution of the speech spectrum, utilizing a time-frequency convolutional module (TFCM) that models long-range dependencies across both time and frequency dimensions. In the second stage, the spectral detail compensation module (SDC-Module) restores missing spectral details by focusing on the difference between the original spectrum and the enhanced spectrum from the previous stage. Additionally, the loss function includes an asymmetric component that penalizes over-suppressed spectra, guiding the model toward an optimal balance. The experimental results on the DNS-Challenge and VoiceBank + DEMAND datasets demonstrate that the proposed method more effectively captures and restores the inherent spectral structure of speech compared to existing SE models."

    "abstract": "Dynamic power analysis in digital integrated circuits (ICs) conventionally relies on gate-level synthesis and simulation, creating a critical bottleneck in iterative design flows. We propose VIRTUAL, a multi-modality learning framework for rapid post-synthesis dynamic power estimation directly from Register-Transfer Level (RTL) implementations and input waveform vectors, eliminating the need for gate-level synthesis and extensive simulation. By decoupling features from input port waveforms and RTL implementations, VIRTUAL employs a transformer-based encoder to extract temporal patterns from input port waveforms and a graph neural network (GNN) to capture structural and functional dependencies within RTL implementations. Through self-supervised contrastive learning across sequential and graph modalities, the framework learns robust power-relevant representations with minimal labeled data. Subsequently, VIRTUAL refines the multi-modality embeddings using a lightweight fusion module and a power prediction head, enabling dynamic power estimation for fixed clock periods within seconds or minutes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate approximately a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.842 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23.43%, while achieving 14.27×speedup compared to traditional gate-level power analysis workflows. Experimental results across diverse RTL designs and input port waveforms validate that our proposed learning-based approach maintains the accuracy while significantly reducing design iteration time, transforming hours of synthesis and simulation into minutes of direct prediction."

In this paper, we propose a novel CIM accelerator based on magnetic random access memory (MRAM) leveraging adaptive multi-sparse mode technology for optimized sparse matrix multiplication in MIMO communication systems. This architecture represents the first application of CIM technology for processing sparse matrices in MIMO precoding tasks, minimizing storage requirements and enhancing parallel processing speed. Experimental results demonstrate that, for a 32×256×8 MIMO downlink precoding task with 90% sparsity, the symbol error rate is reduced to 0.1% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, achieving 8.35× reduction in storage overhead, 39.4× power saving and 9.85× speedup.

    "abstract": "Fine-pitch hybrid bonding offers significant power, performance, and area (PPA) benefits for 3D ICs. However, existing electronic design automation (EDA) tools lack native support for multi-tier integration, prompting the use of pseudo-3D design flows based on conventional 2D tools. Still, these flows often overlook key 3D-specific constraints, such as via count limitations and overlap avoidance, resulting in 3D via overflow and design rule violations of 3D via pitch overlaps. Furthermore, in the context of heterogeneous 3D ICs with different technology nodes, prior works fail to incorporate critical design considerations, including timing-aware cell assignment, congestion management, and wirelength control. In this paper, we propose a unified 3D IC design framework addressing these limitations through four key techniques: (1) Generalized footprint contraction to support both heterogeneous and homogeneous 3D integrations; (2) A constraint-driven tier partitioning for pitch-based 3D via budgeting that reduces 3D via count by up to 62% and maintaining 3D via utilization between 45–89%; (3) A timing-aware gain to steer performance-critical cells to the faster die, improving final WNS and TNS by up to 62% and 74%, respectively. (4) A post-route 3D via legalization stage eliminates all overlapping 3D vias utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) that minimizes design quality degradation. Evaluations on various homogeneous and heterogeneous 3D integrations on representative benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves timing, wirelength, and power, while removing all 3D via violations compared to conventional pseudo-3D flows."

It enables face-to-face (F2F) die coupling via a custom bonding layer derived from the original technology file. For scalability assessment, we highlight its compatibility with commercial-level PDKs through specific manual handling, while this methodology proves implementable in proprietary EDA tools, with open-source EDA exhibiting superior 3D-aware potential. Leveraging Open3DFlow’s open-source advantages that facilitate AI integration, we demonstrate automated bonding pad placement and Tcl script generation using large language models (LLMs), thus enhancing design productivity.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial memory and computational demands. While low-precision quantization offers a promising solution, the presence of activation outliers severely degrades model accuracy. Existing approaches either compromise hardware efficiency through misaligned memory access or sacrifice quantization granularity through rigid bit-width allocation, particularly when handling non-uniform tensor distributions across and within layers. This paper presents a hardware-software co-designed framework resulting in an outlier-adaptive LLM inference accelerator with memory-aligned mixed-precision group quantization, named OA-LAMA. The framework comprises three key innovations: First, an outlier-adaptive memory-aligned mixed-precision group (OAMAG) format with a novel outlier reordering technique is proposed to preserve accuracy while maintaining DRAM-aligned memory access. Second, a distribution-aware group allocation strategy is proposed to address inter-layer outlier ratio variance. Finally, we design the OA-LAMA hardware architecture with a three-level accumulation architecture and timing-balanced processing elements to support the OAMAG format efficiently. Evaluations demonstrate that OA-LAMA achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art 4-bit quantization methods while delivering 1.21–3.09× performance improvement and 1.35–2.47× energy efficiency gains over leading LLM accelerators. OA-LAMA establishes new Pareto frontiers in accuracy-efficiency co-optimization for LLM inference. OA-LAMA is open-sourced at https://github.com/CLab-HKUST-GZ/ICCAD25_OA-LAMA.git."

A particularly interesting application of microfluidics are so-called Organs-on-Chips, i.e., microfluidic devices that mimic the structure and function of human organs and, therefore, allow studying the effects of drugs and diseases. Recent recognition of the need for standardization in this domain has led to the generation and uptake of new ISO standards—providing the basis of modular and reusable microfluidic building blocks that allow for various organ-on-chip setups. However, designing these building blocks, especially so-called routing blocks that interconnect pumps, cell cultures, and other modules is a cumbersome, repetitive task that is still conducted manually. In this work, we propose a design and routing method that significantly simplifies the design of such routing blocks by fully automating the process of interconnecting components of a microfluidic chip. The evaluation of physical, fabricated routing blocks that were designed using the proposed method showcases its feasibility in real-world applications and its potential to reduce design effort and time significantly. In order to make the work accessible to the microfluidic community, we provide implementations of the resulting methods in the form of a user-friendly, interactive online tool, provided as part of the Munich Microfluidic Toolkit (MMFT)."

Beyond ensuring privacy-preserving operation and resilience in connectivity-limited environments, edge deployment offers significant energy and cost advantages over cloud-based solutions. However, deploying large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks on edge GPUs faces critical challenges from strict latency constraints and limited computational resources.To navigate these constraints, developers must balance multiple design factors—choosing reasoning versus non-reasoning architectures, selecting appropriate model sizes, allocating to-ken budgets, and applying test-time scaling strategies—to meet target latency and optimize accuracy. Yet guidance on optimal combinations of these variables remains scarce.In this work, we present EdgeReasoning, a comprehensive study characterizing the deployment of reasoning LLMs on edge GPUs. We systematically quantify latency-accuracy tradeoffs across various LLM architectures and model sizes. We systematically evaluate prompt-based and model-tuning-based techniques for reducing reasoning token length while maintaining performance quality. We further profile test-time scaling methods with varying degrees of parallelism to maximize accuracy under strict latency budgets. Through these analyses, EdgeReasoning maps the Pareto frontier of achievable accuracy-latency configurations, offering systematic guidance for optimal edge deployment of reasoning LLMs."

    "abstract": "As technology advances, photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are rapidly scaling in size and complexity, with modern designs integrating thousands of components to meet the demands of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and chip-to-chip optical interconnects. However, the analog custom layout nature of photonics, the curvy waveguide structures, and single-layer routing resources impose stringent physical constraints, such as minimum bend radii and waveguide crossing penalties, which make manual layout the de facto standard. This manual process takes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable for large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted force-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with limited routability and scalability. To fill this fundamental gap in the electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain, we present Apollo, the first GPU-accelerated, routing-informed placement framework tailored for large-scale PICs. Apollo features an asymmetric bending-aware wirelength function with explicit modeling of waveguide routing congestion and crossings to preserve enough routing spacing for routability maximization. Meanwhile, conditional projection is employed to gradually enforce a variety of user-defined layout constraints, including alignment, spacing, etc. This constrained optimization is accelerated and stabilized by a custom blockwise adaptive Nesterov-accelerated optimizer, ensuring stable and high-quality convergence. To catalyze research in PIC layout automation, we also develop and open-source large-scale PIC benchmarks derived from real-world photonic tensor core designs. Compared to existing methods, Apollo can generate high-quality layouts for large-scale PICs with an average routing success rate of 94.79% across all benchmarks within minutes. By tightly coupling placement with physical-aware routing, Apollo establishes a new paradigm for automated PIC design—bringing intelligent, scalable layout synthesis to the forefront of next-generation EPDA.

CTDM replaces repeated logic patterns with a single logic pattern and register chains, which can take advantage of built-in shift register primitives. It reduces FPGA resource utilization more effectively than conventional multiplexer-based Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) approaches by minimizing logic overhead and routing congestion. The automated CTDM compiler supports various hardware design languages (HDL) including Verilog, VHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS), and Chisel, as well as a wide range of FPGA devices—from small on-premise boards to server-grade hardware simulators like Synopsys ZeBu. To extend the applicability of CTDM to multi-FPGA systems, we propose a block interleaving technique that hides inter-FPGA link latency and fully utilizes the pipeline in a high-speed serial I/O channel. When applied to NVIDIA Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA), CTDM achieved a 66% and 82% reduction in LUT and FF utilization, respectively, and enabled the successful deployment of the largest variant of NVDLA on a single AMD U250 FPGA device. This demonstrated a 3,653× acceleration in NVDLA simulation time over the Synopsys VCS simulator on a CPU.

The proposed MPC strategy uses the LSTM model within an optimization framework guided by Particle Swarm Optimization to minimize a cost function combining effluent quality and operational cost.

Despite promising results obtained in a number of studies, the method has not gained widespread adoption.

    "abstract": "This article presents a method for multi-channel localization of intervertebral disc pathology. The proposed approach focuses on identifying herniations and protrusions by analyzing changes in the electrical impedance of muscle tissue. Analytical studies of electrical impedance signals in the paraspinal muscles within pathological areas revealed variations in the pulsatile component of impedance. This phenomenon is associated with increased blood perfusion in affected muscles due to the diation of blood vessels responsible for their circulation. Increased blood filling will result in a decrease in the displayed electrical resistance of biological tissue measured on the surface of the skin of the back. Experimental validation was conducted using MRI images of the lumbar sacral region in volunteers, confirming the reliability of the proposed method. The developed diagnostic technique enables mass screening not only for patients experiencing pain but also for individuals unaware of their intervertebral disc herniation, as well as those at risk of developing the condition. This approach offers a promising, non-invasive tool for early detection and monitoring of spinal disc pathologies, facilitating timely medical intervention."

By employing massively parallel, event-driven processing, they overcome the inherent limitations of the conventional von Neumann architecture arising from serial processing and the memory wall problem. One of key requirements for implementing SNN hardware is the realization of artificial neurons, which generate spike signals once sufficient synaptic inputs are accumulated. This review summarizes and compares recent advances in single transistor neuron devices (1T-neurons), which offer excellent scalability and full compatibility with standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. First, the working principle of 1T-neurons is primarily described, followed by an overview of their various structures and advanced functionalities. Next, cointegration strategies with artificial synaptic devices and sensory neurons for in-sensor SNNs are introduced. Finally, the challenges and prospects of developing 1T-neurons are discussed."

    "abstract": "Backscatter communications, an emerging low-cost and low-consumption green communication paradigm, has received significant attention in both industry and academia. In recent years, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has also been integrated into backscatter communications to meet the requirements of transmission performance in IoT scenarios. However, due to the hardware limitations of backscatter tags, one of the main challenges for multi-antenna backscatter tags is to reduce the circuit complexity of space-time block codes (STBC) while maintaining transmission performance. Although low-complexity STBC for dual-antenna tags has been explored, to the best of our knowledge, research on high-performance, low-complexity STBC for four-antenna tags remains in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a 2×4 extended Alamouti code (EAC) with full-rate capability for MIMO backscatter communications. The results show that the required impedance of the proposed EAC on the backscatter tag is less than half of that of the conventional orthogonal STBC (OSTBC), which considerably reduces the complexity of the tag circuit. Additionally, we also derive the asymptotic closed form expression of the symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed EAC to obtain the system insights. The derivation results show that the achievable diversity order of the proposed EAC in 1×4×N backscatter channel is 2×min(2,N), which indicates that the proposed EAC can achieve the same diversity performance as the conventional OSTBC by setting an appropriate number of receiver antennas. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to validate the accuracy of our analysis and the superiority of the proposed EAC in SER."

    "abstract": "The lithium-ion battery is a complex multi-physics system, wherein real-time monitoring of its internal thermal behavior remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional thermal modeling approaches, especially those employing high-resolution simulations, have been widely adopted to capture detailed spatial temperature distributions. However, the substantial computational burden associated with such methods hinders their applicability for real-time thermal field reconstruction. In this study, we propose a Generative Thermal Reconstruction (GenTR) framework that synergistically integrates artificial intelligence with physics-based modeling to address this limitation. GenTR enables the real-time generation of dynamic, high-resolution thermal field distributions (128×128 pixels) directly from coarse-resolution physics-informed inputs (8×8 nodes). For the first time, the proposed GenTR framework enhances conventional Generative artificial intelligence approaches by integrating rigorous physics-based guidance, thereby enabling real-time reconstruction and visualization of internal temperature fields with only 150 iteration steps. The method supports high-resolution, image-based thermal field generation while preserving physical consistency. The effectiveness of GenTR is experimentally validated on practical battery cells under both static and dynamic operating conditions. Across all test scenarios, the mean absolute percentage errors remain below 1%, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability. Comparative analyses further reveal that GenTR not only resolves the convergence limitations inherent in conventional numerical models but also significantly enhances the fidelity and robustness of generative artificial intelligence-based thermal estimation approaches."

    "abstract": "The contraction high-order born approximation (CHBA) based on the three-dimensional finite volume method (3-D FVM) in the cylindrical coordinate system is implemented for logging while drilling (LWD) azimuthal propagation resistivity with a grooved drill collar. The rigorously convergent contraction operator of CHBA guarantees efficient and high-precision electromagnetic (EM) simulation of an arbitrary perturbed model under a known reference model. In addition, in the case of exponentially perturbed conductivity models, multi-model simulations are reduced to solving multi-transmitter EM fields in the known reference model by the CHBA. Due to the obvious advantages of CHBA in multi-model and multi-source simulations, it is applied to efficiently establish a correction library for drill collar and borehole environment. The efficiency is increased by more than 3 times when compared to the model-by-model method for the specific library. By investigating the numerical responses in the correction library, we find that the borehole with high-resistivity mud has little effect on the compensated responses, and only the calibration for drill collar effect is needed. However, the azimuthal response suffers from very strong nonlinearities, requiring specific corrections. On the basis of these findings, the air-hang calibration method is validated, and the accuracy of compensated resistivity proves the feasibility of the air-hang calibration method over different resistivity intervals, which provides a theoretical basis for practical application."

In the proposed structure, a broadband omnidirectional rectenna and a single-band dual-polarized rectenna with high-gain are designed and combined together. This makes the proposed hybrid rectenna can collect RF energy from a broad frequency range and realize dedicated high-efficiency WPT, simultaneously. For the broadband rectenna unit, it has broadband and omnidirectional characteristics. These two characteristics are beneficial for effectively RFEH. Besides, for high-efficiency dedicated WPT system, a 5.8 GHz dual-polarized rectenna with high-gain is developed. To validate the proposed design scheme, a prototype is implemented. The simulated and measured results show that the proposed hybrid rectenna has a high RF-DC power conversion efficiency (> 50%) over a wide frequency range from 1.55 to 3.61 GHz. Thus, the GSM-1800, UMTS-2100, ISM-2400, 5G-3500 and WLAN can be covered. In addition, the proposed single-band dual-polarized rectenna achieves a 12.73 dBi gain at 5.8 GHz. These two rectenna units have a high isolation. This ensures the proposed hybrid rectenna can work independently for WPT and RFEH modes."

    "abstract": "Power grids, photovoltaic (PV) systems, electric vehicles (EVs), EV charging stations, and lithium-ion storage solutions rely heavily on embedded systems, making them vulnerable to hardware and cyberattacks. As these systems become increasingly connected through digital control and data networks, their exposure to cyber threats also increases. For management, control, and communication, these systems depend on microprocessors and integrated circuits (ICs), which makes them susceptible to adversarial attacks. This survey provides a detailed discussion of hardware-based attacks, such as tampering, cyberattacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, data integrity attacks, denial-of-service attacks, side-channel attacks, and hardware Trojans (HT). It also examines how attackers might take advantage of weaknesses in the design, firmware, or supply chain of embedded hardware. The paper assesses the potential impact of these security threats on embedded systems across power grids, PV systems, EV infrastructure, and lithium-ion storage systems. Further, it highlights countermeasure techniques to secure these systems and mitigate the threats. Preventive and responsive methods, such as encryption, anomaly monitoring, secure hardware features, and trusted startup processes, are outlined. This paper aims to raise awareness of the importance of strong security strategies to develop robust EVs, renewable energy sources, and power grid infrastructure. The goal is to support engineers, researchers, and policymakers in building safer and more reliable energy systems for the future."

    "abstract": "The four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicle (4WID-EV) with typical redundancy characteristics provide a flexible control scheme, including functions such as active front steering (AFS), active rear steering (ARS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC). However, existing work lacks a reasonable method for obtaining the optimal slip ratio based on the 4WID-EV stability control inputs. This is due to the lack of a reasonable method to characterize the lateral stability of the 4WID-EV and the tire force is affected by a variety of parameters, making it difficult to calculate its optimal slip ratio in real time. Thus, this paper investigates methods for characterizing the lateral stability states of 4WID-EV and it incorporates real-time vehicle state monitoring to determine the optimal slip ratio under combined-slip conditions based on effective tire usage rate. Firstly, based on the sideslip angle-yaw rate (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">β-γ</i>) phase plane analysis, stability boundaries in the front and rear tire slip angle phase plane (α<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>ƒ</sub></i>-α<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><sub>r</sub></i>) are established, which are more suitable for the lateral stability assessment of 4WID-EV under DYC and ARS stability control inputs. Next, an optimal slip ratio calculation method based on lateral stability assessment and effective tire usage rate is proposed to improve the effective utilization of tire force under combined-slip conditions. Finally, based on the back propagation (BP) neural network, an identification model of the optimal slip ratio is established. The test results show that the mean square error (MSE) of the optimal slip ratio under various driving scenarios is 1.1305 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup> and the correlation coefficient (R-value) of the correlation coefficient is 0.9808."

    "abstract": "Sequence logic learning, an important research areas in logic learning, often exhibits characteristics such as high dimensionality, unknown data significance, and complex embedded logical patterns, and it is currently difficult for humans to accurately model all patterns related to prediction. In this paper, we propose a multi-view neural architecture search method for image sequence logic prediction (LogicNAS) in a data-driven way. Specifically, firstly train a set of feature extractors to extract multi-view features from sequence logic data. Secondly, define a super-network that is identical in architecture to the largest network defining the search space and shares a common set of weights among its sub-networks. Then, sub-networks are randomly sampled from the super-network, and the super-network is trained using batches of multi-view features. Thirdly, initialize a population with these sub-networks and conduct a neural architecture search for sub-network structures. Allow the sub-network to adaptively select the views and the fusion operators to be used, and then the sub-network is evaluated directly through the super-network parameters. Lastly, take the sub-networks obtained in the last step as a new population and repeat the last step until the optimal sequence logic prediction network is obtained. This network is then utilized for predicting the logic of image sequences. The experiment results on eight image sequence logic datasets show that our method is effective."

To address these gaps, we propose a generalizable and accessible cache security metric, the Cache Access Security Metric (CASM). CASM measures how much leakage is present in a given cache architecture using a variety of characteristics. We then incorporate CASM into the popular processor simulator, gem5. We evaluate the security of various cache architectures, secure and non-secure, using CASM to demonstrate its potential."

Processor-centric CPU and GPU architectures, commonly used for graph applications, often face bottlenecks caused by extensive data movement between the processor and memory units due to low data reuse. As a result, these applications are often memory-bound, limiting both performance and energy efficiency due to excessive data transfers. Processing-In-Memory (PIM) offers a promising approach to mitigate data movement bottlenecks by integrating computation directly within or near memory. Although several previous studies have introduced custom PIM proposals for graph processing, they do not leverage real-world PIM systems.This work aims to explore the capabilities and characteristics of common graph algorithms on a real-world PIM system to accelerate data-intensive graph workloads. To this end, we (1) implement representative graph algorithms on UPMEM’s general-purpose PIM architecture; (2) characterize their performance and identify key bottlenecks; (3) compare results against CPU and GPU baselines; and (4) derive insights to guide future PIM hardware design.Our study underscores the importance of selecting optimal data partitioning strategies across PIM cores to maximize performance. Additionally, we identify critical hardware limitations in current PIM architectures and emphasize the need for future enhancements across computation, memory, and communication subsystems. Key opportunities for improvement include increasing instruction-level parallelism, developing improved DMA engines with non-blocking capabilities, and enabling direct interconnection networks among PIM cores to reduce data transfer overheads."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a trend towards reconfigurable fabrics at the intersection between field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs): using FPGA-like interconnect but word-based and built around coarse-grained primitives. These architectures often employ complex clusters with far more heterogeneous resources than FPGAs or typical CGRAs— sometimes over a hundred primitives, most of which are bypassable. As a result, clustering, the problem of covering the application netlist with architecture clusters, is a key challenge for design tools targeting these fabrics. Clustering is analogous to the instruction selection problem in CISC architectures, albeit with orders of magnitude more complex \"instructions\". In this work, we propose a two-phase, architecture-agnostic clustering algorithm that scales to highly complex architecture clusters. The first phase enumerates potential cluster matches in the application netlist using a strategy based on an abstract decision tree. The second phase selects a cover from the enumerated matches. We show that our algorithm effectively prunes the search space for complex clusters, scales well to circuits composed of many clusters, and achieves better clustering quality than CLUMAP, a state-of-the-art CGRA clustering algorithm, for the simple cases that CLUMAP can handle."

    "abstract": "Digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) is playing an increasingly vital role in efficient AI computing due to its significant efficiency advantages. However, the combination of memory and computation logics in DCIM presents challenges for testing, including extra coupling fault between memory and logic, high overhead for golden result generation and indirect fault location. In this paper, we present a golden-result-free BIST structure together with a computation-coupled CIM BIST algorithm to reduce testing overhead and improve test coverage. In addition, we present CIMTester, a DCIM BIST compiler to adapt to swiftly changing test requirements and DCIM macro sizes and numbers in chips. The template-based generator generates BIST RTL based on proposed BIST structure and modifies the templates according to the architecture parameters of test chip. CIMTester’s iterator analyzes diverse sharing strategy of BIST components to satisfy user specifications of area, test time and fault coverage. We implemented and evaluated a series of TSMC 22nm DCIM macros with the generated BIST circuits, which achieves up to 99.48% fault coverage with only less than 2.44% area overhead."

    "abstract": "Exact feedback linearization serves as a fundamental method for nonlinear control, as it enables the construction of a reversible coordinate transformation which maps the original nonlinear system into a linear one. This thereby allows the application of standard linear control techniques. However, its application relies on certain prerequisites, notably the system’s relative degree, i.e., pole-zero excess, being well-defined and constant. A key challenge arises when this condition is not met, leading to so-called singularity cases, which can obstruct the straightforward implementation of the linearization technique. The scope of the current paper is to propose a composite control law, comprised in a state feedback linearization in addition to a control barrier function-type auxiliary command to compensate residual nonlinearities by avoiding such domains from the state-space. We use the classical ball and beam process benchmark from the literature. The development of the composite control law is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, leading to a convex solution. The potential of the method is illustrated through numerical simulation, by emphasizing problematic initial conditions for the ball and beam process."

    "abstract": "Even though robots have been developed that can create artistic paintings under the new developments brought by artificial intelligence, human painters, through the \"soul\" they dedicate to the artistic act, bring a certain uniqueness to the works, something that is currently unmatched by technology. However, the use of robots can help human artists to reduce their working time, which is largely occupied with operations in the preparation stage, such as multiplying certain models or cutting stone for mosaics. This paper studies the possibility of creating a low-cost robot for making templates, useful both for professional painters and for beginners who will be helped to learn certain elementary techniques. In the initial stage, an elementary model was simulated, based on an Arduino Uno development board. Starting from the simulated model, a new model was proposed by adding an SD card module on which the G-code files with the models to be drawn are loaded. An LCD display and buttons for selecting the desired file were also added. This model may be challenging for users without technical skills. Therefore, a new constructive variant was proposed, in which the Arduino board was replaced with an ESP32 development board, with a built-in WiFi module and can be connected directly to a smartphone, on which a dedicated mobile application runs. The robot was tested to multiply some templates for mosaic work. The results showed that the total working time was reduced by approximately 20 hours from 25 hours by using the equipment, compared to the situation of making the entire template only manually. As a future direction of research, the addition of a stone cutting module is considered, this being also an operation that, if done manually, takes up a lot of time."

    "abstract": "Superconducting Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) logic, characterized by low power consumption and high-frequency operation, has broad application prospects and holds substantial potential for future computing technologies. However, ensuring the correct operation of RSFQ circuits requires inserting numerous D flip-flops (DFFs), which substantially increase circuit area and energy dissipation. Recent studies have demonstrated that the multiphase clocking scheme can effectively reduce the number of required DFFs. Despite these advantages, existing placement tools do not support multiphase clocking RSFQ circuits. To address this limitation, this paper introduces J2Place, a novel multiphase clocking-oriented length-matching placement framework for RSFQ circuits. Our approach introduces two new RSFQ cells, TFFDO and TFFDE, to simplify the clock network in two-phase clocking designs. We propose a maximum flow-based method to generate the clock distribution column by column and utilize dynamic programming to minimize the total vertical wirelength while maintaining fixed placement orders. Additionally, to expand the solution space, we propose a length-aware reordering method to reduce the wirelength further. Experimental results on ISCAS85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of J2Place compared with state-of-the-art methods."

This paper focuses on the specifications, design (synthesis), implementation, and verification of event-driven systems. The OETPNs are further extended to process events that occur immediately between ticks. The OETPN executor algorithm is further developed to receive, process, and respond to events by adding a new kind of transitions, \"Asynchronous transitions\", those transitions are connected to input channels to receive events and are executed immediately, even between ticks. For verification, a new method for converting OETPN to Stochastic Time Petri Nets (STPNs) is proposed to assess the temporal behavior of the system so that the state class graph can be generated to detect the change of the program structure during execution time. An example of an event-driven system (Urban Vehicle System Traffic Jam Detection and Traffic Light Control Systems) is demonstrated starting from the specifications, design, and implementation with OETPNs and the verifications using the proposed method to transform OETPNs to STPNs."

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) provides strong privacy guarantees by enabling computation directly on encrypted data, but at the cost of substantial computational overhead. Despite recent advances in algorithms and hardware, a gap remains between theoretical feasibility and practical deployment. To close this gap, we advocate a new encrypted computing paradigm that integrates application-level insights with ciphertext encoding to maximize Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) efficiency. Specifically, it comprises (1) pattern-aware encoding along the dominant reduction axes to reduce rotations, (2) Interleaved Assembling to re-densify ciphertexts after dimension reductions, and (3) encryption-aware Rot-structural pruning to exploit weight sparsity in accelerating encrypted neural network computation. On GPUs, it achieves speedups of up to 191× (Cora), 96× (Citeseer), 27× (Pubmed), on graph neural networks (GNNs) and 7.8–27.6× (MNIST and CIFAR-10) on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as LeNet, VGG5, ResNet20, all without accuracy loss. We conclude with an outlook on extending this design to large language models and beyond."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity and integration of automotive electronic systems, driven by advancements in intelligent vehicles and autonomous driving, make functional safety (FuSa) verification critical for ensuring system reliability. Traditional fault injection (FI) methods face inefficiencies, scalability limitations, and interpretability gaps, hard to meet the stringent requirements of ISO 26262 standards for safety-critical automotive systems. This paper proposes an explainable Graph Neural Network(GNN)-based framework for FuSa verification in automotive electronics through three core contributions: graph neural networks for modeling circuit structures to identify critical fault nodes, gradient-driven feature importance analysis to optimize selective hardening with minimal resource overhead and GNNExplainer to visualize critical nodes and connections driving fault-criticality predictions through subgraph analysis. Validated across diverse circuits the framework achieves up to 99.6% precision and 99.8% F1-score in fault detection while significantly reducing the simulation time. Notably, the framework improves accuracy by approximately 5% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while requiring only half the fault injection data. Integrated explainable artificial intelligence techniques provide transparent decision traces, ensuring compliance with ISO 26262 traceability requirements. Through feature selection, the framework achieves comparable accuracy with a minimal feature set, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance. By bridging AI-driven automation with rigorous safety certification, this work establishes a scalable, efficient, and interpretable solution for FuSa verification in automotive SoCs."

    "abstract": "Complementary FET (CFET) is a promising device architecture that proceeds the CMOS scaling during the post-nanosheet device era. Among several CFET variants, Double-Row (DR) CFET further enables 15% track height scaling on standard cells, by sharing a middle row of vias, while sustaining an optimized Middle-Of-Line (MOL) process complexity. In this study, half-height double-row (hDR) CFET is proposed as a highly practical and impactful design style to overcome the cell and block level limitations of DR CFET architecture. First, hDR CFET introduces a high flexibility on standard cell layout design with significant area optimization. Secondly, hDR cell insertion in the backend physical design flow further optimizes the cell placement, and recovers block level area scaling to match the cell height scaling. Results on A7 CFET technology library show area reduction up to 50% on standard cell layouts. Moreover, block level PnR results after enabling only 6 types of hDR cells in standard cell library show 10% of area scaling on ARM Cortex-M0 32-bit core at 90% utilization, proving the strength of the concept. Finally, 14% of block level area scaling is further projected for an enriched standard cell library with an extended set of hDR cells."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to achieve exponential speedups over classical approaches. However, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum circuit scalability remains limited by gate fidelity and qubit counts, restricting physical implementations to small-scale circuits. While prior work has explored logic network structures for quantum circuit synthesis, these methods often neglect the spatial structure intrinsic to Boolean functions. In this paper, we leverage this spatial structure, encoded by parallelotopes embedded in the hypercube defined by the Boolean function, to access a broader optimization space, enhancing synthesis efficiency and reducing circuit complexity. We propose the Spatial Structure-based Hypercube Reduction (SSHR), a novel synthesis method tailored for small-scale Boolean functions (≤ 8). SSHR extracts global spatial features to minimize the use of Multi-Control Toffoli (MCT) gates. To further exploit spatial correlations, we introduce two variants: SSHR-H employs heuristic functions to accelerate synthesis runtime, while SSHR-I integrates an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to maximize spatial structure utilization. Our approach outperforms existing techniques in small-scale circuit synthesis, achieving 56% and 81% reductions in CNOT gate counts compared to the Exclusive Sum-of-Products (ESOP) and Xor-And-Inverter Graph (XAG) methods, respectively."

Many approaches rely on manually designed or domain-specific safety rules, which may limit adaptability or require extensive prior knowledge. This paper introduces an environment with action-dependent dynamics and partial observability, designed to test and compare safe RL methods. A classic unconstrained RL algorithm is evaluated alongside two safety-oriented techniques: hard action masking and a novel soft action masking method. The latter estimates empirical risk during training and uses an annealing schedule to gradually reduce the likelihood of unsafe actions, without relying on predefined constraints. Experimental results show that soft action masking provides a flexible and effective compromise between exploration and safety in both deterministic and nondeterministic settings."

    "abstract": "The importance of anomaly detection in time-series data is widely acknowledged in diverse sectors such as industrial processes, healthcare systems, and financial markets. Solutions to this problem are diverse but can be broadly classified as either classical statistical methods or more recent machine learning techniques that leverage data to detect anomalies. The primary goal of this paper was to examine the strengths and weaknesses of a specific type of anomaly detection that relies on data reconstruction using autoencoders. To this end, we sought to evaluate the relative performance of various latent space modelling strategies employing a consistent BiLSTM architecture for the encoding and decoding components. The results indicate that reducing the latent space dimensionality without additional structural modifications leads to degraded performance. This degradation is more pronounced in deterministic methods compared to stochastic methods, which demonstrate better generalisation capabilities even at smaller latent space sizes. Additionally, the study reveals that incorporating a GAN-based methodology into reconstruction methods does not significantly enhance performance but can help when the design is cohesive. Also, when an appropriate threshold is selected, reconstruction methods achieve a high degree of reliability in minimising false negatives, where anomalies are incorrectly classified as normal."

    "abstract": "Air quality has become a topic of growing interest in recent years, especially after the pandemic made people more aware of the environments they live and work in. While many studies focus on air pollution outdoors, the quality of indoor air is not explored as much, even though it affects people just as directly—particularly now, when working from home has become common. In this context, it's not enough just to monitor the air; what really matters is to act in time and try to prevent the quality from dropping too much. One way to do that is by predicting how air quality will evolve, so that systems like ventilation can be turned on earlier, before things get worse. This paper presents an analysis of several neural network models based on time series, trained to predict the indoor air quality index (AQI) 15 minutes ahead. The data used for training was collected over a period of one year and includes the concentrations of eight different gases measured in an enclosed space. Several Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) models with different layer configurations were trained using MATLAB, and their prediction results were compared to find out which setup performs best when it comes to forecasting indoor air quality."

Task dependencies are analyzed offline using a domain-specific language (DSL) to generate optimized schedules. At runtime, a hardware scheduler performs fast dependency checks and task dispatching. Experimental results show efficient parallel scheduling with minimal overhead, positioning the framework as a practical solution for latency-sensitive applications such as wireless baseband processing."

    "abstract": "Small air gap magnetic coupling wireless power transfer (MC-WPT) systems are subject to simultaneous variations in self-inductance and mutual inductance due to the influence of magnetic materials, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal efficiency operation. This article proposes an optimal efficiency tracking method for MC-WPT systems based on primary and secondary cooperative control, which comprehensively addresses variations in self-inductance, mutual inductance, and load parameters. The proposed method achieves secondary resonant loop tuning and optimal load matching through frequency adjustment and active rectifier (AR) control for optimal efficiency tracking. Additionally, the system maintains constant power output through primary inverter phase shift modulation. Furthermore, zero voltage switching operation of both the inverter and AR is realized by optimizing the primary resonance parameters and AR control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the system can achieve optimal efficiency tracking while delivering constant output power under concurrent variations in self-inductance, mutual inductance, and load. The system efficiency remains above 93.2%, with a peak efficiency of 95.7%."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a passive levitation design for long vertical motion by using two permanent magnets. The design consists of a stationary magnet with optimized concave profiles and a vertically movable magnet. Optimization is conducted through analytical computation of the interactive forces between two general magnets. Design examples show that a movable cubic magnet, with a payload exceeding 200 times its own weight, can maintain static balance at various heights within a vertical range of up to three times its side length. The gravity reduction can achieve 93% theoretically and 86% experimentally. Moreover, the study identifies an optimal side length ratio of 1:3 between the movable cubic magnet and the stationary magnet, with the bearing payload force scalable through dimensional upscaling. The presented magnetic levitation design offers potential applications in other fields, such as robot gravity compensation and constant-force generation."

    "abstract": "Currently, the remote sensing fine-grained rigid object detectors mainly face two challenges: fuzzy localization and inaccurate classification (including misclassifying and multi-classifying). Firstly, mainstream detectors based on the “dense prediction” paradigm suffer from a misalignment between anchor points (APs) and ground truths (GTs). Commonly, they adopt multi-stage regression as a solution, which brings an ambiguous sample definition problem and redundant computational costs. Secondly, two factors seriously affect the classification. They are the insufficient sample learning caused by the long-tail distribution of categories, and the difficulty in extracting discriminative features caused by slight inter-class variance. To address the issues above, we propose an efficient aligning and completing detector (ACDet) based on a single-stage structure. Firstly, the Adaptive Anchor Alignment Mechanism decouples the centripetal sampling bias in the categorical features and leverages it to learn the APs aligned with GTs. It is plug-and-play, requiring no additional supervision annotations. Secondly, a novel Online Tail-sample Supplementation algorithm is proposed. It dynamically maintains class balance during training and can be easily added as post-processing behind existing sample assignment strategies. Thirdly, an Adaptive Group Perceptron is designed to effectively enrich the diversity of features and enhance the model’s ability to extract discriminative features. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACDet achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) level, even surpassing competitive multi-stage detectors, with fewer computing resources and a faster inference speed. The code will be public after the paper is published."

    "abstract": "Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been driving modern advancements in artificial intelligence. With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion, leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory."

Our system employs a tailored dynamic time warpingbased similarity measure to enable comparison of interaction sequences. Based on the sequence similarities, we provide stepwise, interactive navigation of clustering results with contextual visual cues for refinement and validation. We further apply process mining to characterize derived clusters.

    "abstract": "Cloud-fog Federated Learning (FL) is promising for collaborative model training in large-scale edge networks. In cloud-fog FL with constrained communication resources, selecting high-quality client models for aggregation is critical to boost the global model. However, the clients in real world hold multimodal and heterogeneous data, while existing selection strategies rarely consider the imbalance of communication cost and model convergence rates across modalities, thus seriously degrading the efficiency of model aggregation. Moreover, most previous multimodal fusion methods require aligned multimodal samples. However, the data of modality-heterogeneous clients may be isolated and unaligned in FL, so these previous methods cannot be applied to such scenarios, thereby hindering the knowledge fusion across various modalities. To address the above issues, we propose a cloud-fog FL system named COOL, which achieves <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">unimodal aggregation</i> at the fog layer and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multimodal fusion</i> at the cloud layer. First, we propose a Modality-aware Online Client Selection (MOCS) strategy to assist unimodal aggregation. Unlike previous selection strategies, MOCS realizes the dynamic selection budget allocation for various modalities by monitoring the convergence gap of modalities, thus striking the performance balance among modality-heterogeneous clients. Second, to overcome the limitation of previous methods that require aligned multimodal data, we propose a Multimodal Fusion strategy with Feature Synthesis (MFFS). MFFS realizes multimodal fusion with isolated samples via adaptive feature synthesis and cross-modal attention training, thus building a more powerful multimodal predictor while preserving the client data privacy. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that COOL has superior performance compared to the existing algorithms."

    "abstract": "In 6G, unmanned vehicles (UxVs) have gained significant interest due to their potential for flexible and dynamic communication support. However, their mobility along trajectories requires the use of multiple antennas to maintain reliable links in dynamically changing channel conditions. This demand often leads to antenna overloading, which conflicts with the energy-constrained nature of UxVs, making it particularly challenging to jointly consider reliability and energy efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel antenna array architecture tailored for UxV communications: Quantized switchable array architecture (QSAA). This architecture is characterized by two key features: (i) switchable antenna modes and (ii) low-resolution quantization. It enables efficient operation with a limited number of antennas by dynamically switching each one between uplink and downlink modes based on traffic demands under strict energy constraints. Furthermore, the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which are known to be a dominant source of power consumption, further reduces power consumption. To fully exploit the benefits of this architecture, we develop an antenna switching algorithm based on a novel uplink/downlink sum capacity decomposition that accounts for quantization errors. Antennas are greedily switched according to their capacity contributions. Additionally, we design a linear downlink beamformer and an uplink filter that explicitly incorporate quantization effects to realize the full potential of the selected antenna set. The simulation results show that the proposed architecture, together with the switching algorithm and beamforming design, significantly improves both spectral and energy efficiency."

This paper proposes a closed-loop adaptive temperature control circuit for a single metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensor that automatically searches for the optimal catalytic oxidation temperature based on its real-time response characteristics. Implemented in a 0.18 μm CMOS process, this design integrates temperature regulation, comparison, and readout functions into a single loop, reducing circuit complexity and area . The overall die area is 1.2 mm × 1.2 mm, operating at 1.8 V, and it supports a wide sensing resistance range from 9 kΩ to 90 MΩ. Experimental results demonstrate that this system effectively identifies the optimal temperature for varying gas concentrations, achieving high selectivity and sensitivity. It shows great potential for portable gas sensing applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial safety, and non-invasive medical diagnostics.

The approach customizes advertisement strategies according to the particular needs of each firm towards maximizing campaign effectiveness while lowering costs. L2A model consists of an RL agent operating in the advertising system, receiving feedback on important performance metrics like click-through and conversion rates. From a repeated learning process, the agent acquires knowledge of ideal budget distribution, audience targeting, and creative ad selection. We test our framework using real-world advertising data from a set of small businesses. Our findings indicate that L2A performs better compared to conventional optimization techniques, attaining higher engagement and conversion rates. Further, the user-friendly graphical interface allows non-marketing users to implement successful campaigns directly, thus making L2A a viable option for small businesses to enhance their advertising performance."

Given their size, distributed training across multiple GPUs is no longer optional but required. As distributed training takes center stage, unlocking parallelism across devices is more important than ever. Still, even the best parallelism techniques face roadblocks imposed by limited memory capacity. Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) o˛ers a compelling solution by automating data transfers between host and device via demand paging, thereby supporting memory oversubscription. Despite its potential, the integration of UVM with various parallelism strategies in distributed training has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study explores new opportunities for leveraging UVM in distributed LLM training. Our analysis shows that finer-grained parallelism accelerates training performance under UVM, although the increased communication between small partitions demands careful attention. This approach also yields better memory efficiency with fewer page faults and contributes to improved scalability. As the first in-depth analysis of parallelism in distributed training with UVM, this work provides key insights into how UVM can be effectively integrated alongside diverse parallelism strategies for training large-scale LLMs."

Existing methods suffer from slow search convergence and inefficient exploration, especially in the multi-corner setting. We introduce SetupKit, a novel framework designed to break this bottleneck using statistical intelligence, circuit analysis and active learning (AL). SetupKit integrates three key innovations: BEIRA, a bias-enhanced interpolation search derived from statistical error modeling to accelerate convergence by overcoming stagnation issues, initial search interval estimation by circuit analysis and AL strategy using Gaussian Process. This AL component intelligently learns PVT-timing correlations, actively guiding the expensive simulations to the most informative corners, thus minimizing redundancy in multi-corner characterization. Evaluated on industrial 22nm standard cells across 16 PVT corners, SetupKit demonstrates a significant 2.4× overall CPU time reduction (from 720 to 290 days on a single core) compared to standard practices, drastically cutting characterization time. SetupKit offers a principled, learning-based approach to library characterization, addressing a critical EDA challenge and paving the way for more intelligent simulation management."

Quartz glass has recently emerged as a promising archival medium, offering multi-century durability, radiation and thermal resistance, and support for three-dimensional data encoding using femtosecond laser writing. However, the hybrid mechanical-optical architecture of glass storage—requiring mechanical movement along the X and Y axes and optical focal tuning along the Z axis—introduces unique performance bottlenecks during data access, which conventional I/O scheduling strategies are not equipped to handle.In this work, we present GAIA, a Glass-Aware I/O middlewAre designed to optimize data access in quartz glass storage systems. GAIA features three coordinated strategies: (1) Zigzag Data Placement, which aligns data with the mechanical stage’s natural motion to minimize direction-switching latency; (2) Z-Axis First Placement, which prioritizes low-latency optical traversal along the depth dimension; and (3) Shortest Moving Time First (SMTF) scheduling, which selects I/O operations based on predicted movement time rather than geometric distance. Through trace-driven simulations using enterprise-scale workloads and various glass sizes, GAIA reduces data read latency by up to 82% compared to traditional baseline schedulers. These results demonstrate the critical importance of middleware-level co-design in unlocking the performance potential of next-generation glass-based storage systems."

Existing pseudo-3D flows rely on 2D IC routing engines, combined with a 3D via legalization step to complete routing. The separation of intra-die and inter-die routing significantly degrades solution quality. To address this issue, we propose H3D, the first native 3D global router designed for face-to-face bonded 3D ICs. H3D constructs a heterogeneous routing grid to represent routing and hybrid bonding terminal (HBT) resources. We develop dedicated dynamic programming-based algorithms to optimize the HBT number and locations for 3D Steiner trees on the heterogeneous grid. Specifically, H3D minimizes the number of HBTs by traversing the Steiner tree in reverse depth-first order and relocates HBTs to legal locations with minimal wirelength in reverse breadth-first order, leveraging the convexity of L1 distance for efficient optimization. Experimental results on various real-world designs demonstrate that H3D achieves 12% shorter wirelength, 25% fewer HBTs, and 1.9× speedup compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM’s MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions."

    "abstract": "Modern VLSI layout pattern generation for design for manufacturability (DFM) at sub-3 nm nodes faces two challenges: 1) the rapid evolution of intricate design rules; 2) the scarcity of high-quality, rule-compliant layout data during the development of new process technologies. To address these challenges, we introduce a diffusion-based framework that re-frames complex layout synthesis as a sequence of template-guided inpainting tasks, which significantly reduces training sample requirements for legal pattern generation. This approach leverages the knowledge of a pre-trained image foundation model to generate layout variations that satisfy complex 2D metal interconnect design rule constraints, and introduces a novel template-based denoising scheme to eliminate residual noisy pixels. Through few-shot fine-tuning, our approach uniquely produces legal layouts conforming to a full sign-off rule deck at sub-3nm nodes while delivering superior pattern diversity, offering a production-ready, data-efficient solution for next-generation technology node development."

    "abstract": "For highly integrated, thermally constrained chiplets, the design process requires iterative shape optimization, making rapid thermal simulation across varying geometries critically important. Existing deterministic approaches, such as COMSOL and HotSpot require solving large-scale linear systems, incurring expensive computational costs. Stochastic methods suffer from slow convergence, demanding excessive resources for high-precision results. Current neural network (NN)-based methods necessitate retraining upon geometry modifications, limiting adaptability. Meanwhile, neural networks suffer from the absence of provable error bounds, introducing three fundamental risks in practical deployment. We enable the fast solution of heat equations for varying geometries and propose a novel solver that integrates operator learning with stochastic methods. By employing diffeomorphic mapping, our approach addresses the challenge of operator networks in handling shape variations. Furthermore, the network’s predictions guide the stochastic method for variance reduction, which extremely accelerates the traditional stochastic method, while the stochastic results provide error guarantees and corrections for the neural network’s outputs. Extensive experiments show that we achieve a speedup of 10.69-23.04× over commercial field solver COMSOL and a speedup of 5.20-11.87× over the traditional stochastic methods."

    "abstract": "A growing trend has emerged in designing high-quality Small Language Models (SLMs) with a few million parameters. This trend is driven by the increasing concerns over cloud costs, privacy, and latency. Considering that full parameter training is feasible for SLMs on mobile devices, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is employed to improve efficiency by reducing computational overhead and memory footprint. However, previous QAT works adopt fine-grained quantization methods to compress models with billions of parameters on GPUs, incompatible with current commodity hardware, such as mobile and edge devices, which relies on Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions. Thus, the generalization of these methods to SLMs on mobile devices is limited. In this paper, we propose Squat method, an effective QAT framework with deployable quantization for SLMs on mobile devices. Specifically, we propose entropy-guided and distribution-aligned distillation to mitigate the distortion of attention information from quantization. Besides, we employ sub-8-bit token adaptive quantization, assigning varying bit widths to different tokens based on their importance. Furthermore, we develop a SIMD-based Multi-Kernel Mixed-Precision (MKMP) multiplier to support sub-8-bit mixed-precision MAC on mobile devices. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements of our method compared to other QAT methods across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37× compared with its FP16 counterparts, signaling a great advancement. Code: https://github.com/shawnricecake/squant"

Its influence must be taken into account in signal processing algorithms when determining blood pressure values. Linear filtering methods promotes significant distortions in the morphology and the oscillations peak values. Under these conditions, it is advisable to use the methods of approximation theory. In order to reduce the respiratory component influence, segmentation of pulse waves sections and their approximation by splines using decompositions according to systems of orthogonal polynomials are proposed in the paper."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms demands efficient computing chips, positioning algorithm-hardware co-design as a crucial optimization strategy. However, automating the co-design process remains challenging due to the lack of a unified exploration framework for both algorithmic and hardware domains, as existing tools - hardware design space exploration (DSE) and compression neural architecture search (Compression NAS) - operate independently, relying entirely on manual collaboration. This paper presents CoXplorer, a co-exploration framework that connects model-compression optimization space and architecture design space. We make three key contributions: (1) a multi-staged co-design space decomposition method that enables systematic exploration of compression-hardware design choices with reduced complexity, (2) an AC-Copilot toolchain enhanced with multi-grained performance modeling driven by hardware simulation-compilation hierarchical cooperation to fulfill various evaluation requirements of co-exploration, enabling balanced simulation accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and (3) a co-exploration workflow with hierarchical and bottleneck-guided search for harmonizing optimization objectives of both model and hardware design spaces, resulting in improved search efficiency. We validate the CoXplorer on two edge chips, which achieve 53.7% throughput and 45.8% energy efficiency improvements for the CNN acceleration, and 7.5× speedup with 9.9× energy efficiency boost for the Transformer acceleration. A case study on large language model acceleration shows CoXplorer’s extensibility to emerging workloads, enhancing LLAMA2-7B inference throughput from 6.75 to 25.46 tokens/s via co-optimization with compression and near-memory computing architecture."

    "abstract": "The research focuses on a deep learning ensemble algorithms approach for classifying ovarian tumor stages, using medical images and specific annotations from the TCGA-OV dataset. Ovarian cancer, a particularly dangerous form of gynecological malignancy, is often diagnosed in advanced stages. After implementing transfer techniques on 5 individual neural networks, including ResNet-50, DenseNet-12, EfficientNet-B3, Vision Transformer (ViT), and MobileNetV2, the best 3 were chosen to create an ensemble model. The ensemble model (Weighted Voting Ensemble) demonstrated an enhanced 97.2% accuracy and an AUC-ROC of 0.985 compared to the best individual neural network performances obtained for Vision Transformer (ViT) -accuracy of 95.4% and an AUC-ROC of 0.971. This approach diminishes classification errors and enhances generalization. The research emphasizes the importance of dataset quality, interpretability, and clinical relevance, proposing future efforts in improving datasets and implementing clinical AI in real-time. The results indicate that AI can greatly enhance the staging of ovarian tumors, lessening diagnostic bias and tailoring personalized treatments."
