    "abstract": "In this paper, we design and fabricate cost-effective, electronics-free millimeter-wave (mmWave) fiducial markers that support clutter-free detection on radars. Fiducial markers are widely used in camera-based systems to provide spatial information in robotic navigation applications. QR-code-like fiducial markers can be readily printed on paper - low-cost, easy to produce, and electronics-free. Yet, an analogous mmWave solution is yet to appear, which stems from the unique challenge in the mmWave context: its vulnerability to clutter. Existing solutions either trade hardware simplicity for clutter resilience or stay simple but remain vulnerable to environmental multipath. This paper seeks to solve this dilemma."

    "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF) techniques have shown promise for continuous contactless healthcare applications. However, real-world indoor environments pose challenges for existing systems, which may struggle to detect subtle physiological signals. This paper proposes Medusa, a novel wireless vital-sign sensing system designed for multi-view setups. It enables users to deploy distributed Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) arrays into their daily living environments, facilitating vital-sign sensing in real-world settings. Unlike most existing single Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) radar-based systems that operate under controlled settings Medusa's primary novelty lies in the design of a first-of-its-kind flexible multi-view vital sign sensing system that is view-agnostic, pose-agnostic, contactless, and can sense basic human vitals with good accuracy. Through our well-engineered hardware and software co-design, Medusa enables real-time processing of large distributed MIMO arrays, while balancing the tradeoff between Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and spatial diversity gain across each of its four distributed 4 × 4 sub-arrays for increased robustness. This is achieved using our novel unsupervised learning model which effectively recovers vital sign waveforms by decomposing the received signals. Extensive evaluations with 21 participants demonstrate Medusa's spatial diversity gain for real-world vital-sign monitoring, enabling free movement and orientation of subjects in both familiar and unfamiliar indoor environments."

    "abstract": "Many devices are accessed and controlled through voice assistants today, a representative example being Echo smart speakers and other Amazon devices controlled by Alexa. These offer the convenience of accessing services through voice interactions, but also raise privacy concerns, as data can be stored and used for personalization, and voice biometric information is sensitive. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of transparency and control over the collection and use of this data. Although prior work has shown evidence of ad targeting based on data derived from voice interactions and user profiles/interests, it has so far been an open question whether voice biometric information itself is utilized for targeting. In this paper, (i) we build a general auditing methodology to answer this question for off-the-shelf commercial smart speakers, and (ii) we apply it specifically to Amazon Echo Dot. Our findings suggest that Amazon Music ad content is more strongly associated with attributes (gender and age) related to voice characteristics than would be expected by chance. This has important implications for compliance, since voice contains sensitive biometric information that is protected by several privacy regulations."

This leaves critical gaps in our understanding of how crises affect specific regions and alternative communication systems. Using PSKReporter's amateur radio data, we present two case studies where distinct signals of crisis events were captured, even when IP-based measurements alone may fall short. During the LA wildfires, PSKReporter spots dropped by 36%, with no comparable decline in IP-based data. For Hurricanes Milton and Helene, spot declines appeared several days earlier than IP-based indicators. These insights open new avenues for studying the resilience of diverse infrastructures during emergencies."

    "abstract": "In-home resistance training (RT) is a convenient and effective way to maintain health and well-being. However, incorrect exercise execution can result in unintended muscle engagement and an increased risk of injury. Without access to professional coaching, an accurate muscle-aware motion feedback system becomes essential for safe and effective training. However, existing visual language models (VLMs) struggle to provide accurate and effective muscle-aware movement guidance due to their limited understanding of RT motion and the absence of related expert knowledge. In this work, we introduce Myo-Trainer, the first vision-based muscle-aware motion feedback system that uses explicit muscle-aware motion analysis and domain-specific expert knowledge to provide corrective guidance on muscle engagement and movement execution. Also, we propose a novel DAGCN-Former network that integrates both spatial and temporal modeling capabilities to capture the complex dynamics of human RT motion. Experiments involving 26 subjects and 1000+ minutes of RT demonstrate that Myo-Trainer improves the accuracy of motion analysis by 17.22%, achieves a 2.5x reduced inference latency and a BertScore of 85.88% of generated feedback compared to those provided by experienced certified trainers, outperforming existing solutions. Additionally, Myo-Trainer received higher satisfaction ratings from participants compared to other AI trainers and video tutorials, highlighting its potential for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Vehicle detection in tunnels is crucial for traffic monitoring and accident response, yet remains underexplored. In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a millimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in tunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by multi-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false alarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to true vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus reserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in occlusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from limited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we develop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane constraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal path loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation method to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly reduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing."

To address this, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device assistant for privacy-preserving personalized smart homes with a tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user interaction while protecting privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional privacy-preserving serving for those users who are unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to remote servers. Experiments demonstrate HomeLLaMA provides satisfactory services while significantly enhancing user privacy."

The proposed method tracks the MTPA point in two stages. The first stage uses the SMESC for the convergence process, while the second stage employs the extremum seeking control without steady-state oscillation (ESC-SSO) for the steady-state process. The switching law between the two algorithms is also reasonably designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by both simulation and experiment."

    "abstract": "MOS devices interface defect density measurements such as the hi-lo CV method and the conductance method are extremely important and widely used. Interface defect response time is a key parameter in both measurements as well as in their interpretations. It is widely accepted that interface defects at energies close to the band edge have too short a response time to be measured properly by these techniques, unless very high measurement frequencies are employed, which greatly increases the experimental difficulty. Consequently, near band edge interface defects are deemed unreliable and generally not reported. Here we show that the time constant of band edge defects has been misunderstood. Specifically, we show that as the capacitor is biased into accumulation – a necessity to measure defect levels near the band edge, the defect response time levels off instead of continuing to decrease. As a result, the commonly available 1MHz measurement frequency is more than adequate even for defects near the band edge."

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of smartphones and other mobile intelligent devices, Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) is widely used. Typically, the real locations of the workers and tasks must be submitted to the service platform to complete the task allocation. Therefore, the protection of location information has become a key factor in influencing user participation. To address the issue of location information leakage, we propose a location information protection method based on local differential privacy, which can protect the location privacy of workers and tasks while generating approximately accurate task allocation results. Firstly, we divide the region into <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>*<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula> grids and merge girds with a similar dispersion to form clusters. Then, this paper utilizes the inverse sampling of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the flipped Huber distribution to generate a personalized noise location set for each cluster. Furthermore, the exponential mechanism is used to select the obfuscated location for each user. Finally, the platform selects workers based on the perturbed location to complete the task allocation. Theoretical analysis shows that our mechanism satisfies differential privacy and achieves an approximately accurate task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, this method exhibits superior performance across different datasets and effectively balances the utility of data and the protection of location privacy."

Segment Anything Model (SAM), as a universal image segmentation model, has been utilized in segmentation tasks. However, SAM’s training on natural images results in a lack of understanding of the general information specific to RSIs. Mamba, as a sequence modeling method grounded in the state space model, can directly capture the global dependencies inherent in RSIs. Its integration with SAM significantly enhances segmentation accuracy in complex scenes. Therefore, SFE-SAM is proposed to enhance Mobile SAM’s capability to comprehend complex scenes and capture global contextual information by introducing Mamba. In SFE-SAM, the SSM Tokening Adapter (STA) is employed to fine-tune the extractor of Mobile SAM, establishing long-range feature correlations. Meanwhile, the Dual Feature Enhancement Module (DFEM) is designed to fuse cross-dimensional features. Finally, the Semantic Information Enhance Module (SIEM) is utilized to improve multi-scale information extraction and dynamic feature enhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that SFE-SAM achieves superior segmentation performance compared to SOTA methods on the LandCover.ai and Vaihingen datasets."

    "abstract": "Magnetic anomaly signals are often severely corrupted by colored environmental noise, particularly in magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) applications. Traditional denoising methods, while effective for Gaussian noise, typically struggle in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and colored noise environments. In addition, conventional deep learning methods such as a single-step U-Net, although effective in moderate noise conditions, may fail to accurately distinguish weak anomalies from noise under extremely low SNR, often producing overly smoothed results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a progressive denoising framework based on a modified U-Net architecture, inspired by the iterative refinement strategies. This progressive U-Net model involves gradually adding noise to data and learning to gradually reverse the noising process step-by-step, which is especially effective at extracting clean data from noise-corrupted measurements under low SNR and colored noise environments. On synthetic data with colored noise and SNR ranging at -20 dB, the progressive U-Net achieves consistent denoising performance, with an SNR improvement up to 1.43 dB, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) improvement of up to 23.52 dB, and structural similarity (SSIM) improvement of up to 0.91. Field tests using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acquired magnetic data further demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in suppressing colored noise and preserving weak magnetic anomaly structures. Compared to the conventional U-Net, the proposed model produces cleaner outputs with clearer dipole features and fewer artifacts. While showing improved robustness to noise characteristics mismatched between training and test data. These results further confirm the robustness and generalization ability of our model, making it a promising approach for practical MAD applications with challenging noise conditions."

A endogenous AC parameters calculation methodology is developed for the case of reactive current injection in the low-voltage side arm (LV arm). Based on harmonic injection and reactive power injection in LV arm, an endogenous AC optimization strategy is formulated with the objective of minimizing required arm voltage. The proposed strategy demonstrates more than 20% voltage reduction compared with conventional methods in 32 kV/10 kV DC system simulations. Experimental validation through comprehensive case studies confirms the strategy's effectiveness in high-voltage side arm (HV arm) and internal common point multiplexing arm (MP arm) submodule failure scenarios."

In contrast, research in other design disciplines has emphasized the importance of framing—how designers define and redefine what the problem is—and the co-evolution of problem and solution spaces through reflective practice. These dimensions remain underexplored in visualization research, particularly from the perspective of expert practitioners. This paper investigates how visualization designers frame problems and navigate the interplay between problem understanding and solution development. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 11 expert design practitioners using design challenges, diary entries, and semi-structured interviews. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identified key strategies that participants used to frame design problems, reframe them in response to evolving constraints or insights, and construct bridges between problem and solution spaces. These included the use of metaphors, heuristics, sketching, primary generators, and reflective evaluation of failed or incomplete ideas. Our findings contribute an empirically grounded account of visualization design as a reflective, co-evolutionary practice. We show that framing is not a preliminary step, but a continuous activity embedded in the act of designing. Participants frequently shifted their understanding of the problem based on solution attempts, feedback from tools, and ethical or narrative concerns. These insights extend current visualization design models and highlight the need for frameworks that better account for framing and interpretive judgment. We conclude with implications for visualization research, education, and practice. In particular, we discuss how design education can better support framing and co-evolutionary thinking, and how visualization research can benefit from greater attention to the cognitive strategies and reflective processes that underpin expert design."

    "abstract": "Rotation-invariant recognition of shapes is a common challenge in computer vision. Recent approaches have significantly improved the accuracy of rotation-invariant recognition by encoding the rotational invariance of shapes as hand-crafted image features and introducing deep neural networks. However, the methods based on pixels have too much redundant information, and the critical geometric information is prone to early leakage, resulting in weak rotation-invariant recognition of fine-grained shapes. In this paper, we reconsider the shape recognition problem from the perspective of contour points rather than pixels. We propose an anti-noise rotation-invariant convolution module based on contour geometric aware for fine-grained shape recognition. The module divides the shape contour into multiple local geometric regions (LGA), where we implement finer-grained rotation-invariant coding in terms of point topological relations. We provide a deep network composed of five such cascaded modules for classification and retrieval experiments. The results show that our method exhibits excellent performance in rotation-invariant recognition of fine-grained shapes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is robust to contour noise and the rotation centers.

    "abstract": "Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BCFL) has attracted considerable attention in the intelligent IoT domain for its privacy-preserving and decentralized characteristics. Depending on their applicable scenarios, BCFL frameworks are categorized into two types: synchronous and asynchronous. However, synchronous BCFL struggles with low efficiency in heterogeneous IoT environments, while asynchronous BCFL suffers from slow convergence speed. In additional, Both BCFL incur significant resource consumption from blockchain consensus mechanisms which is unrelated to federated learning tasks, leading to resource wastage and poor scalability, making them unsuitable for large-scale IoT networks. To address these challenges, we propose CoCFL, a novel BCFL framework utilizing multi-chain collaboration. CoCFL introduces two lightweight sub-chains: PoCFL-CChain and PC-CChain, based on different FL strategy. PoCFL-CChain uses a synchronous FL strategy for learning devices with similar performance to generate high-accuracy models, while PC-CChain adopts an asynchronous strategy for heterogeneous devices, which can improving training efficiency. CoCFL assigns devices to suitable sub-chains based on their performance to carry out FL tasks and aggregates the sub-chain models into a global model. This multi-chain collaboration strategy enhances model accuracy and convergence speed and significantly improves the scalability of BCFL. In additional, the consensus mechanisms in CoCFL sub-chains not only maintain the blockchain ledger but also handle FL-related tasks such as detecting poisoning attacks, assigning roles, and distributing incentives. This design not only improving the efficiency of BCFL, but also enhances learning security and ensuring fair incentives. Experiments show that CoCFL improves learning accuracy by 6% and efficiency by 18% over existing BCFL frameworks. It also demonstrates excellent scalability, with time consumption liner decreasing as sub-chains increase, and can withstand up to 40% of poisoning attacks while ensuring fair incentives."

    "abstract": "Many practical engineering systems, classified as nondifferentiable sandwiched dynamic systems (NSDSs), pose significant challenges to controller design due to their inherent unknown nondifferentiable nonlinearities. Among these, gear transmission servo (GTS) systems constitute a prominent research focus, exemplifying the complexities associated with modeling and control in NSDSs. Specifically, gear backlash introduces internal dead-zone nonlinearities, causing detrimental effects such as vibrations, diminished control accuracy, and potential instability. Such systems, characterized by unknown parameters including dead-zone characteristics, form fourth-order nonlower triangular dynamic structures, further complicated by uncertainties and external disturbances that impede convergence and controller performance. To address these critical challenges, this article proposes a novel block-structured control framework (BSCF) integrating feedforward compensation, nonlinear extended state observers, and dynamic surface control techniques, all built upon system identification results. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to establish that the tracking error converges to a bounded neighborhood of the origin, with the ultimate bound being adjustable through suitable parameter tuning. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in eliminating the adverse effects of dead-zone nonlinearities and achieving satisfactory tracking accuracy. Furthermore, this control framework demonstrates broad applicability and can be extended to other sandwiched systems featuring nondifferentiable nonlinearities and/or nonlower triangular structures."

A multistage combination strategy enables wide bandwidth operation, overcoming the limitations of cavity resonators.

A detailed analytical framework is developed by modeling the temporal detection behavior of SPDs as a Markov process, capturing the effects of dead time across consecutive PPM symbols. Closed-form expressions are derived for slot-wise detection probabilities, symbol transition matrices, and symbol error rate (SER) under maximum-likelihood detection. To enhance spectral and energy efficiency, a probabilistic shaping scheme is introduced and optimized using a truncated Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, allowing the transmitter to adapt its symbol distribution to the nonlinear detection characteristics of the SPD array. The proposed model is validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Results show that probabilistic shaping significantly improves communication sensitivity, reducing the required number of photons per bit by up to 25% in photon-starved or high-noise regimes."

    "abstract": "We contribute an autoethnographic reflection on the complexity of defining and measuring visualization literacy (i.e., the ability to interpret and construct visualizations) to expose our tacit thoughts that often exist in-between polished works and remain unreported in individual research papers. Our work is inspired by the growing number of empirical studies in visualization research that rely on visualization literacy as a basis for developing effective data representations or educational interventions. Researchers have already made various efforts to assess this construct, yet it is often hard to pinpoint either what we want to measure or what we are effectively measuring. In this autoethnography, we gather insights from 14 internal interviews with researchers who are users or designers of visualization literacy tests. We aim to identify what makes visualization literacy assessment a “wicked” problem. We further reflect on the fluidity of visualization literacy and discuss how this property may lead to misalignment between what the construct is and how measurements of it are used or designed. We also examine potential threats to measurement validity from conceptual, operational, and methodological perspectives. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose several calls to action aimed at tackling the wicked problem of visualization literacy measurement, such as by broadening test scopes and modalities, improving test ecological validity, making it easier to use tests, seeking interdisciplinary collaboration, and drawing from continued dialogue on visualization literacy to expect and be more comfortable with its fluidity."

    "abstract": "Wireless Technology Recognition (WTR) and localization are essential in modern communication systems, enabling efficient spectrum usage, coexistence across diverse technologies, and accurate positioning in dynamic environments. Real-world deployments must handle signals from different sampling rates, capturing devices, frequency bands, and propagation conditions. Traditional methods, such as energy detection and conventional Deep Learning (DL) models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often fail to generalize across unseen technologies, environments, or tasks. In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based foundation model for both WTR and localization, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale unlabeled aciq and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) timeseries data. The model aims reusability and generalizability compared to single-task architectures. It leverages input patching for computational efficiency and employs a two-stage pipeline: self-supervised pre-training to learn generalpurpose representations, followed by lightweight fine-tuning for task-specific adaptation. This enables the model to generalize to new wireless technologies and unseen environments using minimal labeled samples. Evaluations across short-range and long-range datasets show superior accuracy in WTR (up to 99.99%), Line-Of-Sight (LOS) detection (up to 100%), and ranging error correction (reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by up to 50%), all while maintaining low computational complexity. These results underscore the potential of a reusable wireless foundation model for multi-task applications with minimal retraining."

Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the influence of these five tip clearance sizes on both the performance and the tip leakage flow within the endwall region of the transonic cascade. The results show that as the clearance increases, the cascade total pressure loss coefficient exhibits a trend of initially increasing, then decreasing, and then increasing again; the diffusion factor within the cascade endwall region initially decreases and then increases; and the blade loading coefficient decreases over approximately the front 40% of the axial chord. Secondary leakage flow is observed near the blade trailing edge, with an increase in clearance causing the counter-flow capability of this leakage flow to first increase and then decrease. Furthermore, the region of high turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) located between 60% and 70% axial chord exhibits a larger extent in the circumferential directions as the clearance increases."

The rise of eVTOLs in various fields has been accompanied by significant icing challenges in cold climates. Conventional anti-icing and de-icing methods have limitations in energy efficiency and sustainability. Superhydrophobic surfaces offer a promising solution due to their ability to delay icing and reduce water droplet adhesion. However, their effectiveness is limited in extreme icing conditions. To address this, this paper proposes an innovative composite anti-icing and de-icing technology. Through a series of experiments in the FL61 icing wind tunnel, the anti-icing and de-icing performance of the system was comprehensively evaluated. The results revealed that the superhydrophobic surface significantly reduced heat dissipation and achieved effective dry anti-icing at various wind speeds. When integrated with electrothermal elements, the system demonstrated remarkable energy savings and efficient ice removal. This study provides a new approach for the anti-icing and de-icing of eVTOLs with high efficiency and low energy consumption."

By comparing water entry velocity, cavity evolution characteristics, flow field parameters, and turbulence properties, the differences between scaled and full-scale models are analyzed. The results indicate that surface tension effects are enhanced in the scaled-down models, and different scaled models exhibit consistent dimensionless velocity at the same dimensionless time. The scaled-down models demonstrate higher local flow velocity, while the full-scale model shows a more uniform flow distribution. Additionally, the scaled-down models have lower turbulent viscosity, faster pressure wave attenuation, and a greater influence of viscous forces. Moreover, the water entry of the scaled-down models amplifies the scale effect on the Q criterion. These findings reveal the impact of scale effects on the water entry process and provide a reference for experimental design and numerical simulations."

Shoreline changes were evaluated using GIS tools, particularly the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), which calculated Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and End Point Rate (EPR). The findings show that the coastal area remained stable between 1938 and $1964\\left(\\sim 0.69 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}\\right)$, followed by significant erosion between 1964 and 1994, with a net loss of 0.2 $\\mathrm{km}^{2}(23 \\%)$. This erosion coincides with the Lebanese Civil War period and related illegal coastal interventions. From 2018 to 2021, an increase in area was observed, probably due to reduced tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic. DSAS results confirmed these trends, with NSM values reaching up to 118 meters and an average EPR of $1.42 \\mathrm{~m} /$ year. The results highlight the impact of human activities on shoreline dynamics and emphasize the need for informed coastal zone management to mitigate future risks."

    "abstract": "To enable deep-sea autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to perform docking and charging operations underwater while ensuring long-duration missions in harsh marine environments, an AUV docking system capable of prolonged underwater operation must be designed to achieve precise alignment between the AUV and the charging module. First, the overall structural design and docking procedure of the underwater docking system are analyzed, followed by the modeling of its control system. Second, to address the challenges posed by complex underwater conditions, a modeling and analysis of a 400-meter-deep underwater environment incorporating ocean current disturbances is conducted. Subsequently, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based disturbance observer is designed to enable real-time estimation of underwater disturbances. The modeled underwater environment serves as the input to evaluate the observer's tracking performance. Finally, a model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) algorithm incorporating the EKF disturbance observer is developed. Using the AUV boost-release process as an example, the AUV is controlled to perform uniformly accelerated linear motion. Simulation results demonstrate that the EKF-based disturbance observer achieves superior tracking and prediction performance compared to conventional disturbance observers, reducing estimation errors to 7.2% of those observed with conventional methods. The proposed EKF-based MRAC algorithm exhibits a maximum tracking error of 1.6% within the first 5 seconds, outperforming conventional adaptive control methods in terms of reduced error and enhanced precision during the docking process. The adaptive control strategy leveraging the EKF disturbance observer proves effective in adapting to complex underwater environments, ensuring precise AUV-to-charging-module docking alignment."

    "abstract": "For polar codes, perturbing received information can enhance the error-correction performance of successive cancellation (SC) decoding. This is an effective approach for realizing low-latency yet high decoding performance for long polar codes, since each perturbation-enhanced SC (PSC) decoding can be performed in parallel. This paper provides theoretical insights into the soft information perturbation. It first reveals that the PSC decoding can be equivalently viewed as perturbing the SC decoding a posteriori log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the information bits. Such a revelation enables us to reduce the perturbation complexity by only targeting the information bits, resulting in an improved PSC (IPSC) decoding. By better utilizing the a posteriori LLRs, a set of possibly erroneous estimations can be formed to be perturbed, further reducing the perturbation complexity. Our simulation results show that, for various codeword lengths, the proposed IPSC decoding can achieve a similar performance as the PSC decoding, while yielding significant perturbation complexity reduction."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel low-complexity discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) scheme designed to reduce computational overhead while maintaining robust performance in wireless communication systems. The core idea is to modify the signal processing chain by merging the computations of multiple functional blocks, resulting in a significant reduction in the complexity of conventional DFT-s-OFDM implementations. A comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the proposed scheme against traditional DFT-s-OFDM, using key metrics such as error vector magnitude (EVM) and computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional DFT-s-OFDM in terms of EVM under various system configurations, while significantly reducing computational complexity. This makes the proposed scheme a promising candidate for next-generation wireless communication systems, particularly in uplink scenarios involving battery-powered devices."

Aiming at low-complexity decoders, we study variants of noise-guessing decoders that use estimators for the probability of a noise sequence when the actual channel law is unknown. A deterministic version produces noise sequences in a fixed order, and a new randomised version draws them at random, until finding one that, subtracted from the received sequence, results in a valid codeword. In all cases, we give sufficient conditions on the family of parametric channels for the decoding strategies to be random-coding universal, and derive upper bounds for their complexity. We give examples of common families of channels in which these conditions are satisfied, and a numerical example illustrates the proposed method’s performance."

    "abstract": "Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, with their distributed vector thrust propulsion drive systems, can effectively enhance the flight quality and fault tolerance for manned vehicle. However, developing a tractable transition trajectory profile that satisfies practical constraints such as energy efficiency and passenger comfort remains an open problem. Especially when considering the disturbance of distributed rotor wakes on the local angle of attack of aerodynamic surfaces, the transition strategy and the resulting trajectory are inevitably influenced. This paper investigates the slipstream effects' impact on energy-optimal transition trajectories in full tilt-rotor eVTOL aircraft. By accounting for propeller-wing aerodynamic coupling effects, a nonlinear dynamic model for its transition phase is established using aerodynamic simulation parameters for an aircraft with six symmetrically distributed tilt-rotors. Under the constraints of actuators and passenger comfort, the numerical solution of the optimal transition trajectory was obtained using the HermiteSimpson direct collocation method with the objective of energy optimization. Simulation results reveal that rotor slipstream effects induce an over 9% increase in energy expenditure during forward-flight transition, alongside substantial trajec-tory deviations. The optimization results provide a reliable preset trajectory for slipstream-compensated control during the tiltrotor eVTOL transition."

This is where Federated Learning (FL) comes as a solution, enabling collaborative model training between several clients without direct data sharing. However, the varied data quality and computational capabilities of participating clients can significantly impact FL’s efficiency and performance in MRI reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive client selection strategy for federated MRI reconstruction. Our method dynamically assesses client contributions, considering factors like data quality, diversity, and computational resources. This allows us to prioritize clients that offer the most beneficial updates to the global model. Through extensive experiments on various MRI datasets, we demonstrate that our adaptive approach significantly improves reconstruction quality and accelerates convergence compared to traditional FL. Moreover, our method consistently outperforms both random client selection and training with all available clients."

Aided by the detection capability of cyclic codes on voted estimates of DD, the output decision is chosen sequentially from estimates given by different perturbations. Simulation results show that it can achieve 1.1 dB gain over DD-OSD for extended Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes, and performs closely to maximum likelihood decoding with moderate complexity."

While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering."

Nonetheless, it may become a spy on users' private activities such as password entry or intimate social interactions. Existing countermeasures include signal obfuscation and adversarial perturbations to hamper and confuse Wi-Fi sensing, yet they both require substantial changes in Wi-Fi hardware/firmware, and they at most stay at user level in protection granularity. This paper presents Poison2Cure, the first semantic-level privacy-preserving framework for Wi-Fi human sensing systems, with full compatibility to any underlying hardware. The innovation behind Poison2Cure lies in feeding poisoned training data from (privacy-sensitive) users to the neural model for Wi-Fi sensing, degrading only the sensing for private activities while retaining that for regular ones. Moreover, we tackle the harsh conditions where the neural model is kept confidential and/or preceded by data cleansing. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that Poison2Cure reduces over 76% of the accuracy for the private activities while keeping the accuracy for regular activities largely intact."

Rhone adopts a two-phase approach: i) an offline phase builds power, thermal, orbit, network, and computation models using real satellite telemetries and hardware-in-the-loop chip mirroring, and ii) an online phase executes container-based emulation integrated with these models. Evaluation shows Rhone's power and computation model errors under 5% and thermal model errors within 1.3 – 2.5°C."

In this paper, we provide and extended analysis on robustness of ChirpEye under varying multipath conditions or highly mobile scenarios. First, we prove that Chirpeye can preserve its accurate radar detection and characterization even under high mobility due to the unique tag structure that cancels out Doppler shifts.

    "abstract": "Knowledge tracing (KT) is a core technology in the field of intelligent education. Its primary goal is to accurately model changes in students’ knowledge states based on their historical answer data, predict their subsequent performance on questions, and thereby support personalized learning recommendations. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a key technical approach in KT research due to their strong capability in modeling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs-based KT models still suffer from three critical bottlenecks: insufficient accuracy in knowledge state updates, weak ability to extract high-order features, and gradient instability caused by parameter initialization.To address these issues, a graph neural network-based knowledge tracing model named DPDG-GKT is proposed. The model includes an improved knowledge tracing gating unit module, which enhances the adaptive control ability for different knowledge concepts through parameterized gating weights. This improved knowledge tracing gating unit module is designed with deeper dual pathways (Erase and Add), and adopts GELU activation and double-layer linear transformation to strengthen the ability of nonlinear feature extraction. Meanwhile, a dynamic gating mechanism is introduced, allowing the model to dynamically adjust the intensity of information updates according to inputs. All parameters are initialized using the Xavier method to improve training efficiency and model stability.Experimental results demonstrate that when the DPDG-GKT model is compared with DKT, DKVMN, DKT+, AKT, GKT, and DGEKT in terms of performance on the ASSIST_ments_2015, ASSIST_ments_2017, and Static_2011 datasets, the AUC values of the DPDG-GKT model’s prediction performance on the three datasets are increased by 1.5%, 3.8%, and 6.5% respectively compared with those of the current models. This fully verifies the superiority of the DPDG-GKT model in knowledge tracing tasks."

These attacks involve the insertion of hidden triggers into the model for malicious purposes during the training process. A variety of efforts have been made to detect backdoors to ensure model security. However, current approaches typically leverage trigger reverse generation and anomalous neuron analysis and are not effective and efficient in detecting various backdoor attacks. To tackle this issue, we present an offense-as-defense (OAD) framework that creatively employs adversarial sample attacks as an approach to backdoor detection. The OAD framework is based on our observation that the existence of a backdoor in a model may change the model behavior under an adversarial sample attack, either strengthening or weakening the robustness of the model against the adversarial sample attack. Therefore, by quantitatively evaluating the magnitudes of change in model performance under adversarial sample attacks, the OAD framework is able to not only detect backdoors in models but also identify the specific backdoor attack methods. The effectiveness of the proposed OAD framework in defending against existing backdoor attacks has been demonstrated through extensive experiments."

Through a combined approach of equivalent magnetic circuit analysis, 3D static magnetic field simulation, and thickness measurement experiments, this study systematically investigated the performance optimization principles of the proposed structure. The results demonstrate that both the magnetic field intensity and thickness measurement signal amplitude of this structure initially increase and then decrease with the enlargement of central magnet dimensions, reaching their maximum values when the magnet occupies 50% of the center.

Our results show that both low-level edges and high-level elements affect perceived VC in visualization images; the number of corners and distinct colors are robust metrics across visualizations. Second, feature congestion, a statistical information-theoretic metric capturing color and texture patterns, is the strongest predictor of perceived complexity in visualizations rich in the same continuous color/texture stimuli; edge density effectively explains VC in node-link diagrams. Additionally, we observe a bell-curve effect for texts: increasing TiR initially reduces complexity, reaching an optimal point, beyond which further text increases VC. Our quantification model is also interpretable-enabling metric-based explanations-grounded in the VisComplexity2K dataset, bridging computational metrics with human perceptual responses."

Extending this paradigm to the underwater domain gives rise to the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), where absorption-limited acoustic and optical links, long propagation delays, and three-dimensional (3D) mobility require specialized, energy-efficient approaches for localization, routing, and synchronization to ensure reliable subsea monitoring and control. However, the unique challenges of underwater environments, such as limited bandwidth, high propagation delay, nonlinear channel characteristics, energy constraints, and localization accuracy, make simultaneous optimization of localization accuracy and network lifetime a complex task. To address these issues, we present a 6G-Enabled Quantum-Aware Federated Reinforcement Learning (6G-QFRL) framework that jointly optimizes localization accuracy and energy efficiency in three-dimensional acoustic IoUT networks. In a 3000 × 3000 × 500 m³ field containing 40 sensors, 6 AUV anchors, and 4 sinks operating over 12 kHz / 2 kHz BPSK channels, 6G-QFRL achieves +32 % longer network lifetime, 25 %localization RMSE, and +18%packet-delivery ratio compared with recent baselines. The controller integrates physics-aware sensing (TOA/AoA + CRLB) with a constraint-aware PPO policy, federated aggregation through 6G edge links, and a quantum-inspired policy head that refines discrete transmission decisions. The approach sustains Jain’s fairness index J>0.9, delay near 1.2–1.8 s, and goodput around 1.0–1.4 kbps, demonstrating that quantum-aware federated intelligence can significantly enhance reliability and endurance in underwater sensing missions."

Growing cross-chain demands require value-exchange mechanisms, yet expose privacy risks during external interactions. Encrypting cross-chain information is necessary, requiring third-party verification of relations within the encrypted content. Existing privacy-preserving cross-chain research for consortium chains struggles to balance transaction efficiency, transaction validity verification, and complex trust assumptions for relays. We present VeCroToken, an efficient, verifiable, and privacy-preserving cross-chain model for consortium blockchains. VeCroToken introduces a dual-balance mechanism and designs four types of cross-chain zero-knowledge transactions based on zk-SNARKs. These transactions encrypt two types of balances and transaction amounts, effectively protecting participant privacy. The encrypted cross-chain data and zero-knowledge proof credentials are stored on participants’ consortium blockchains and the relay chain. Relay nodes and third parties can validate transaction proofs with public parameters, preserving privacy while ensuring compliance and validity. We give a security analysis in the UC framework that proves verifiability and balance safety. We also provide a privacy analysis establishing the amount, balance, and fund-correlation privacy. We implement a prototype on Hyperledger Fabric. Our experimental results show that VeCroToken has a lower overall zero-knowledge proof overhead than the state-of-the-art models and performs well in transaction performance."

    "abstract": "We contribute an autoethnographic reflection on the complexity of defining and measuring visualization literacy (i.e., the ability to interpret and construct visualizations) to expose our tacit thoughts that often exist in-between polished works and remain unreported in individual research papers. Our work is inspired by the growing number of empirical studies in visualization research that rely on visualization literacy as a basis for developing effective data representations or educational interventions. Researchers have already made various efforts to assess this construct, yet it is often hard to pinpoint either what we want to measure or what we are effectively measuring. In this autoethnography, we gather insights from 14 internal interviews with researchers who are users or designers of visualization literacy tests. We aim to identify what makes visualization literacy assessment a “wicked” problem. We further reflect on the fluidity of visualization literacy and discuss how this property may lead to misalignment between what the construct is and how measurements of it are used or designed. We also examine potential threats to measurement validity from conceptual, operational, and methodological perspectives. Based on our experiences and reflections, we propose several calls to action aimed at tackling the wicked problem of visualization literacy measurement, such as by broadening test scopes and modalities, improving test ecological validity, making it easier to use tests, seeking interdisciplinary collaboration, and drawing from continued dialogue on visualization literacy to expect and be more comfortable with its fluidity."

A parallel decoupling self-planning search-attack algorithm (PDSPSA) is designed to solve the uncertainty of the mission environment and the coupling of the search-attack. To this end, the proposed algorithm can be divided into four modules: a Beta distribution-based probability map module to obtain more information in uncertain environments, a distributed ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO)-based cooperative search module, a Dubins curve-based waypoints online optimization module, and a reward estimation-based parallel decoupling module. Therefore, the threat avoidance algorithm in the online optimization module is designed for possible threat areas and information exchange to update the feasible trajectory, and the parallel decoupling module based on reward estimation is composed of a short-term reward and expected future reward with a heuristic basis. Finally, the stability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through both simulations and physical experiments. Its performance is further confirmed by comparison with alternative algorithms commonly employed in the multi-UAV cooperative search-attack coupling problem."

Recently, tens of pathway-informed deep learning models in cancer research have been proposed due to their interpretability and high performance. However, there is still a lack of reviews that have a specific focus on the application strategy of pathway information in the pathway-informed deep learning models. Hence, we surveyed the pathway-informed deep learning models in cancer research. In this survey, the pathway information used in pathway-informed models was summarized into four categories; pathway-informed deep learning models were divided into three major categories and seven subcategories based on the pathway information utilized and the strategies employed for its application. For each subcategory, the application strategy of pathway information is illustrated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the pathway-informed models are summarized. Besides, the commonly used interpretability methods and pathway databases are provided to assist in the design of more effective models. Finally, the challenges faced in developing better pathway-informed deep learning models are presented."

    "abstract": "A novel global MPPT (GMPPT) technique for a partially shaded photovoltaic (PV) system based on an artificial intelligence strategy that hybridizes decision trees (DTs) with the classic perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is presented in this article. This hybridization ensures the best trade-off between both techniques, which means a fast response during steady-state with a low computational cost provided by the P&O algorithm and an outstanding response to variations in irradiance, even in situations of partial shading through the DT method. In this sense, the DT method requires a high demand for data with different irradiance cases for offline training. However, its implementation generates a straightforward structure that is easy to evaluate in real-time with a low computational cost, enabling deployment on low-cost microcontrollers. The proposed technique has been extensively validated with different experimental results using a photovoltaic emulator and a DC-DC power converter controlled by a low-cost microcontroller. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over two classical techniques designed to operate under solar partial shading conditions."

    "abstract": "With the explosive deployment of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), the computational complexity of network performance analysis is rapidly escalating. As one of the most suitable mathematical tools for analyzing large-scale network topologies, stochastic geometry (SG) enables the representation of network performance metrics as functions of network parameters, thus offering low-complexity performance analysis solutions. However, choosing between planar and spherical models remains challenging. Planar models neglect Earth's curvature, causing deviations in high-altitude NTN analysis, yet are still often used for simplicity. This paper introduces relative error to quantify the gap between planar and spherical models, helping determine when planar modeling is sufficient. To calculate the relative error, we first propose a point process (PP) generation algorithm that simultaneously generates a pair of homogeneous and asymptotically similar planar and spherical PPs. We then introduce several typical similarity metrics, including topology-related and network-level metrics, and further develop a relative error estimation algorithm based on these metrics. In addition, we derive an analytical expression for the optimal planar altitude, which reduces computational complexity and provides theoretical support for planar approximation. Finally, numerical results investigate how deployment altitude and region affect NTN modeling, with case studies on HAP and LEO satellite constellations."

    "abstract": "Solenoid valves, serving as critical actuators in automated control systems, require meticulous structural optimization to enhance operational efficiency. To address the computational inefficiency inherent in high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, this study proposes a Kriging surrogate modeling framework driven by Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and finite element analysis (FEA). This approach reduces computational costs while maintaining prediction accuracy, with the Kriging model establishing a robust nonlinear mapping between armature geometry parameters (H and L) and transient response metrics. A NSGA-II (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) multi-objective optimization framework was subsequently deployed, identifying a Pareto-optimal armature configuration (H=O.77 mm, L=4.17 mm) that minimizes both valve opening time (Tt=4.1 ms) and closing time (T2=6.8 ms). FEA validation confirmed the model's reliability, achieving Tt=4.3ms and T2=7.2ms with relative errors of 4.65% and 5.56%, respectively — both within the industrial tolerance threshold «6%). The optimized design offers a scalable methodology for energy-efficient electromagnetic actuator design in automotive and robotic systems."

This study investigated the strengthening and toughening mechanisms of 304 austenitic steel at different temperatures. The characteristics of gradient twin structure and gradient phase distribution resulting from pre-torsion under different temperatures were presented. The combination of twin and phase gradients leads to the strength-ening and toughening in 304 austenitic steel in the subsequent tension. The number of twin structure gradually increases from core to edge and the number of twin types also increases: in the central region, the main type of twinning is primary twinning, and a large number of secondary twins are observed at the edge with a large shear strain of 0.52. As temperature decreases, the grain size gradually refines and the number of twin structure increases respectively. Pre-torsion at different temperature re-sults in a significant increase in ultimate strength and yield strength at corresponding temperatures. The simultaneous at-tainment of both strength and ductility in 304 austenitic steel with pre-torsion is in striking contrast to the usual strength-duc-tility trade-off in steels."

Runtime assertions detect double-locking and orphaned synchronization states, stabilizing shared resource management in resource-constrained environments. Validation through adversarial fault injection and stress testing confirms the elimination of race-induced crashes, advancing reliability in safety-critical automotive middleware without requiring architectural overhauls of legacy components."

In this paper, a simulation model of the EPRE was built based on AMESim, and the start-up process of the system was simulated under design conditions. The results show that the system can achieve the expected design indicators. During the simulation, it was found that the mixture ratio fluctuated drastically in the climbing stage of the start-up process. Since the pump acceleration rate directly affects the flow rate of propellant components, it indicates that the acceleration rates of two pumps in the climbing stage of the start-up process are of certain research significance. Through simulation analysis, appropriately accelerating the acceleration process of the methane pump so that the acceleration rate of methane flow is slightly higher than that of liquid oxygen can effectively reduce the fluctuation amplitude of the chamber pressure in the climbing stage of the start-up process, making the process more stable and reliable."

    "abstract": "The Posidonia oceanica meadows and dead leaf accumulations along the Mediterranean seashores (known as banquettes), are key habitats for coastal marine environments, providing many ecological functions and ecosystems services. Despite their ecosystem services, the banquettes are still perceived as an “obstacle” to tourist and recreational activities, potentially unsafe for humans, trapping marine debris. This negative perception leads to ecologically and economically unsustainable management approaches, mainly removal and disposal in landfill with negative impacts on the environment (e.g. beach integrity alteration, biodiversity reduction) and increasing costs for beach cleaning. Despite their key ecological roles, banquettes are poorly investigated, concerning both their distribution and role as potential sink and source of contaminants (including microplastics). In this framework we investigated the Posidonia banquettes by using a multidisciplinary approach which includes: i) a GIS-based mapping of P. oceanica deposit sites along Italian coasts, and integration of other useful data (e.g. proximity to seagrass meadows, beach utilization, protected areas, etc.); ii) in situ survey of three selected sites; iii) physico-chemical characterization of banquettes samples for microplastic detection. Preliminary results contribute to improve scientific knowledge about the banquette (mapping and monitoring) and provide technical support for sustainable management of “Posidonia beaches”."

Most of these threats cut across the lengths of conventional cryptographic modes against the advance of quantum computing. The research paper introduces “Q-SafeAV”, which forms an altogether new quantum secure intra-sensor communication structure able to withstand threats specifically from autonomous vehicle (AV) networks. The approach incorporates quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in the formation of quantum secured channel for communication with informational theoretical security properties between vehicle sensors for ensuring information integrity and authenticity in real-time operational environments. The framework identifies important weaknesses today that exist in current automotive communication protocols while being able to meet stringent latency requirements that are extremely crucial for safety-critical applications. To test and validate the proposed methodology, extensive experimentation were conducted, and it was observed that “Q-SafeAV” shows processing latencies below 10 milliseconds provide it with enhanced security based on quantum mechanical principles, making it suitable for real-time applications in AVs. The experimental results provide quantum-safe protection against both current and future computational attacks. Overall, the research addresses a crucial portion of growing demands for quantum-resilient security frameworks in next-generation autonomous transportation systems."

Metoceanic information, such as tides, currents, wind, and ocean waves, is estimated using numerical models and validated, adjusted, or corrected from in situ real-condition measurements. However, the models for calculating these parameters, the adjustment methodologies, or data assimilation may not be accurately adjusted to specific local conditions. Regarding ocean wave forecasting, although the development of new technologies and artificial intelligence has contributed to reducing the error between the modeled variables from various numerical models validated worldwide and those recorded insitu, further work is still required. The present study performs corrections with Generalized Additive and XGBoost models between the corrected significant wave height obtained from different altimeter and in situ buoy missions in the Tyrrhenian Sea. In particular, adjustment methods are applied to output variables from numerical wave models, such as significant wave height and peak period. Results have shown improvements in adjustment through Machine Learning methods. Coefficient of determination has increased from approximately 0.30 to 0.65, and the root mean square error fell from 0.55 to less than 0.3 over the study region. Trained Machine Learning models are generated from the correction methods over the area of study in the Tyrrhenian Sea, which can be reused to correct data from alternative models or predictive wave models as an application of the present research."

    "abstract": "In the literature, it has been shown that feedback does not increase the optimal rate-distortion region of the dirty paper channel with state estimation at the receiver (SE-R). On the other hand, it is well-known that feedback helps to construct low-complexity coding schemes in Gaussian channels, such as the elegant Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) feedback scheme. This motivates us to explore capacity-achieving SK-type schemes in dirty paper channels with SE-R and feedback. In this paper, we first propose a capacity-achieving feedback scheme for the dirty paper channel with SE-R (DPC-SE-R), which combines the superposition coding and the classical SK-type scheme. Then, we extend this scheme to the dirty paper multiple-access channel with SE-R and feedback, and also show the extended scheme is capacity-achieving. Finally, we discuss how to extend our scheme to a noisy state observation case of the DPC-SE-R. However, the capacity-achieving SK-type scheme for such a case remains unknown."

    "abstract": "In spite of their broad popularity, blockchain systems are increasingly facing issues related to large storage overhead and computational cost. A commonly proposed solution to blockchain scalability is the inclusion of so-called light nodes. Light nodes are resource-constrained users who do not routinely download the full block of transaction data; rather, they rely on full nodes to broadcast fraud proofs if any transaction in a block is invalid. While this approach allows resource-constrained nodes to participate in a blockchain, it also exposes them to a so-called Data Availability (DA) attack. A DA attack is described by an event in which an adversarial block producer creates a block containing invalid transactions to be hidden from the rest of the network. Error-correcting codes are a promising solution to DA attacks by forcing the adversary to withhold a larger portion of the block (that holds invalid transactions), thus making adversarial actions easier to be discovered by honest nodes in the network. In a previous work by Al Bassam et al., it was recognized that 2D Reed-Solomon codes are a promising code construction due to their small fraud proof sizes. In this work, we develop new light node sampling strategies, tailored for 2D Reed-Solomon codes, that increase the resilience of the system against DA attacks. We compare our solution to the naive random sampling without replacement and demonstrate significant gains."

Based on the relative orbital elements between satellites, a task-driven multi-satellite formation configuration is designed. Considering the influence of various complex perturbations in the geostationary orbit environment comprehensively, a model predictive configuration maintenance control strategy based on virtual formation optimization is proposed according to the current formation state and the principle of fuel balance, to solve the problem of high-precision relative configuration maintenance of multi-satellites under fuel optimization. Through numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control strategy are verified. The results show that this method can maintain the relative stable configuration of the multi-satellite formation for a long time, providing important technical support for the engineering application of geostationary orbit multi-satellite formation."

To this end, Jinhyun So et al. recently developed a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation scheme using a secret-sharing strategy over finite-field arithmetic. However, such an approach can suffer from numerical errors and overflows when applied to real-valued model updates, motivating the need for secure aggregation methods that operate directly over the real domain.We propose FORTA, a Byzantine-resilient secure aggregation framework that operates entirely in the real domain. FORTA leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes for privacy and employs Krum-based outlier detection for robustness. While DFT decoder is error-free under infinite precision, finite precision introduces numerical perturbations that can distort distance estimates and allow malicious updates to evade detection. To address this, FORTA refines Krum using feedback from DFT decoder, improving the selection of trustworthy updates. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our modification of Krum offers improved robustness and more accurate aggregation than standard Krum."

    "abstract": "The Supersonic Separation Line (SSSL) nozzle plays a pivotal role in augmenting thrust vectoring performance by significantly turning the flow and amplifying the output angle. This amplification is facilitated by an intricate internal shock-expansion wave system. The interaction between this wave system and the fluid flow is a critical factor in the design of SSSL nozzles. In the present study, a three-dimensional numerical model was employed to simulate the internal flow dynamics within the SSSL nozzle. The model successfully resolves the shock-expansion wave structure, flow deflection induced by the wave system, and the amplification effect resulting from non-uniform velocity distribution. This research examines the non-uniform flow field generated by the complex wave system, with particular emphasis on the asymmetric flow characteristics and their influence on velocity profiles, flow deflection, and overall thrust vectoring performance. To assess the impact of varying design parameters, numerical simulations were conducted on a conical nozzle configuration under different swing angles. The findings reveal that the amplification is strongly dependent on shockwave positioning, with the amplification factor weakening as the mechanical deflection angle increases. The insights derived from this study contribute to a foundational framework for advancing supersonic separation line nozzles, with the potential to optimize shockwave utilization for enhanced lateral force generation."

The achieved return loss range is from 14 dB to 27 dB, with a bandwidth varying from 950 MHz to 5 GHz. In addition, its ultra-compact size of $(4.00 \\times 4.82 \\times 0.25) \\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ makes it a suitable candidate for next-generation wireless systems.

    "abstract": "The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), powered by large language models, has led to the emergence of real-time, voice-based conversational applications that enable dynamic, multi-modal interactions for everyday tasks such as checking the weather or planning a trip. These human-to-GenAI calling applications blend speech processing, generative intelligence, and real-time communication, presenting new challenges in latency optimization, network infrastructure design, and resilience under load. Despite their growing popularity, little is known about the operational characteristics and performance of these applications. This paper conducts an empirical measurement of six human-to-GenAI calling applications from Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, focusing on their input/output modalities, network behavior, latency metrics, and robustness. Our findings reveal key design choices and performance bottlenecks in these emerging applications. For example, the conversational latency often reaches several seconds, far exceeding the typical sub-second delays of human-to-human voice communication and potentially impairing interactivity. Moreover, voice-based GenAI traffic is inherently asymmetric: the uplink, carrying real-time human speech, benefits from streaming-based transmission, while the typically large downlink GenAI responses are better served through batch-based delivery."

Despite its popularity and the number of studies conducted on it, much less is understood about the way in which YouTube's Data API, and especially the Search endpoint, operates. In this paper, we analyze the API's behavior by running identical queries across a period of 12 weeks. Our findings show that the search endpoint returns highly variable results between queries. Specifically, the API seems to randomize returned videos based on the relative popularity of the respective topic during the query period, making it nearly impossible to obtain representative historical video samples, especially during non-peak topical periods. Our results also suggest that the API may prioritize shorter, more popular videos, although the role of channel popularity is not as clear. We conclude with suggested strategies for researchers using the API for data collection, as well as future research directions on expanding the API's use-cases."

    "abstract": "BGP is the de facto protocol used to manage a network's reachability on the Internet. Network operators announce and withdraw their prefixes on BGP to enable or to prevent communication towards their origin network, respectively. However, the withdrawal of a prefix could fail to propagate totally in the Internet and routes towards withdrawn prefixes could remain in the routing tables of routers. These routes are called stuck or zombie BGP routes, and their persistence can lead to performance degradation, or even partial or complete outage. In this paper, we first revisit existing work on BGP zombies using RIPE RIS beacons, identify the double-counting discrepancy, and revise the methodology to address this problem and detect zombies more accurately. Second, we point out limitations of the RIPE RIS beacons with respect to their periodicity, lack of diversity, and noise, and introduce and deploy our own beacons, which address these limitations. Using our beacons and the revised methodology, we analyze the lifespan of BGP zombies. We show that zombie routes can persist in RIBs for days, weeks, or even months. Furthermore, we document that BGP zombies can be announced months after their original withdrawal, affecting new ASes. Finally, we discuss interesting cases of long-lived zombie outbreaks that affected large ISPs with hundreds of ASes in their customer cones."

In this paper, we introduce PipHeap, a pipeline-friendly, binary-tree-based min heap that can enhance existing sketches without introducing additional errors. Through evaluation with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PipHeap can reduce the error of these integrated algorithms by 33% to 97% (78% on average) under the same memory allocation. We have successfully implemented PipHeap and its combination with six different sketches in our testbed, and successfully extended other approximate algorithms (e.g. Space-Saving) onto programmable switch platforms. We have made all code associated available as open-source."

    "abstract": "Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF) configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for SAGUIN."

The circuit was fabricated on a 27μm thick flexible polyimide substrate using a NMOS only, single gate amorphous-Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistor technology (TFT). Reliable response of the D-FF was noticed from measurements up to a clock and an input signal frequency of 20 MHz and 2 MHz, respectively. Further, with an output voltage swing of 60%, D-FF functionality was observed up to clock and input signal frequencies of 25 MHz and 3 MHz, respectively. This circuit has shown a power dissipation of 140 μW including buffers and the figure of merit (FOM) of 142 MHz/mW, which is almost a 52% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, this D-FF is employed in the implementation of an 11-bit up/down (U/D) counter. The U/D counter has shown a reliable operation up to an operating frequency of 8MHz with a power consumption of 4.8 mW. Both circuits were characterized at a low supply voltage of 3V, occupying an active area of 0.144 mm and 4.32 mm, respectively. These circuits would find potential application in biomedical wearable devices."

    "abstract": "The rise in frequency and severity of extreme weather events highlights the need for resilient power distribution networks. Microgrids can help improve the resilience of distribution grids by providing continuous power supply using local distribution generation (DG) when the distribution grid fails. In this paper, we propose an approach for optimal placement and sizing of DG to form multiple microgrids throughout the distribution network by restoration actions such as switching operations in case of distribution grid outages caused by extreme weather events. Considering the randomness of damaged distribution lines, the DG placement and sizing problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program, with the first stage determining the placement and size of DG, and the second stage focusing on minimizing the amount of load shedding through network restoration and microgrid formations for each scenario. Due to the large number of scenarios, the sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to solve the problem. The results of case studies on a modified IEEE 33 bus distribution grid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DG placement and sizing strategy in improving the resilience of distribution grids by allowing the formation of multiple microgrids. In addition, the robustness and accuracy of the SAA method are validated through various case studies."

This article presents a self-orienting wireless power transfer (SOWPT) system based on coupled magnetic fields. A novel gyroscope-inspired power receiving device (PRD) is designed to maintain the one-dimensional receiving coil (1DRC) inside the PRD axial alignment with the one-dimensional transmitting coil (1DTC), thereby enabling omnidirectional power transfer for the MCR. The theoretical model of power transfer for the SOWPT system is developed through theoretical analysis and finite element analysis. A finite element model for human electromagnetic exposure safety is developed, and the electromagnetic safety compliance of the SOWPT is validated. Finally, a prototype of the SOWPT system has been fabricated. An experimental testbed is constructed to evaluate the received power on the load. Experimental results demonstrate that under emulated practical conditions, the normalized standard deviation (NSD) and the maximum-to-minimum ratio (MMR) of the received power on the load are 13.86% and 163.41%, respectively. These values are substantially lower than those of conventional WPT systems, validating the enhanced robustness of the proposed SOWPT system. A temperature rise experiment is performed on the PRD, validating its operational safety under designated working conditions. Furthermore, the developed theoretical model of power transfer is experimentally verified, laying the theoretical foundation for subsequent optimization."

    "abstract": "As communication technologies evolve, the AI agent communication network (ACN) is expected to play a critical role in enabling future wireless services. These networks must meet diverse connectivity demands, provide enhanced intelligence, and provide reliable communication support for AI agents. In this work, we propose an integrated computation-communication (ICC) architecture that jointly addresses baseband signal processing and neural network (NN) inference within a shared computing framework. A unified modeling approach is established by combining multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) channel representation with neural network–based application modeling. On the communication side, we derive spectral efficiency and channel capacity expressions that incorporate quantization error, transmit power, and noise, thus characterizing hardware-induced constraints on channel performance. On the computation side, we analyze the model scaling in terms of depth, width, and input resolution. Building upon this framework, we formulate the joint resource allocation challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We introduce a learning-driven allocation algorithm that uniquely combines Gibbs sampling with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning agent to solve this MDP. This enables the system to dynamically distribute resources across communication and computation, adapting to variations in datasets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, model configurations, and scenario constraints. The proposed approach improves both task completion time and prediction accuracy compared to conventional fixed resource allocation schemes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, highlighting its potential for efficient cross-layer co-design in next-generation ACNs."

    "abstract": "This study presents a novel synergistic actuator integrating thermo-pneumatic actuation and shape memory alloy (SMA) springs, achieving distinct operational modes with a single energy input. Conventional artificial muscles typically rely on a single actuation mechanism, limiting functionality. By combining thermo-pneumatic and SMA-based actuation, this actuator achieves cooperative, composite, and antagonistic modes without the use of a pneumatic pump. The cooperative mode utilizes the simultaneous actuation of both mechanisms to increase force and displacement output. The composite mode enables distinct actuation tasks, demonstrated through a soft robotic gripper capable of shape-adaptive grasping. The antagonistic mode exploits the opposing force generation of the two actuation sources by using a vacuum-based thermo-pneumatic actuator, facilitating bidirectional motions without additional bias mechanisms. Experimental evaluations confirmed improved force outputs and controllability under payload conditions with the actuator lifting payloads up to 20 kg. A thermodynamic model was combined with a quasi-static force model to predict the behavior of the actuator. The proposed actuator concept enables pumpless actuation of an actuation with two actuation sources using a single energy input and increases the performance of the actuator versus using a single actuation source while increasing the versatility of the actuator through its various modes of operation."

    "abstract": "The distributed rooftop solar energy systems, in general, feed surplus power into the distribution network. To handle the power injection under a distorted grid condition, this work proposes a new method of synthesizing inverter modulation through grid-aligned and quadrature voltage amalgamation. Through analytical analysis, it is identified that the quadrature voltage is responsible for the grid power injection; however, the decoupling between the active and reactive power due to stray resistance is accomplished with the simple proportional regulator. Apart from the proportional regulator, the proposed current control does not require additional current regulators. In the proposed current controller, the grid power injection is achieved through the dc capacitor power balancing method, eliminating the need for resonant regulators. Conversely, the synthesized aligned voltage from the grid voltage with reduced delays helps to eliminate the grid current harmonics under distorted grid conditions. Apart from the grid power shaping, the proposed controller synthesizes the equivalent loop gain infinite with the formation of virtual feedback due to dc capacitor charge balance, ensuring zero tracking error. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of zero tracking error and enhanced power quality is verified experimentally on the lab prototype."

Visualizing the motion of 3D anatomical structures, such as organs and tumors, is critical for computer-aided interventions. However, conventional 4D volumetric reconstruction methods typically produce a limited set of volumes at discrete phases, suffering from low temporal resolution. Moreover, it often requires extensive segmentation of 3D structures or regions for visualizing volumetric data, making it challenging to segment and visualize dynamic volumes in real-time. To address these challenges, VolMoVis framework employs a continuous implicit neural representation that decomposes the dynamic volumetric data into a static reference volume and a continuous deformation field. This decomposition, along with an efficient deformation network, enables our framework to achieve real-time volume generation and volumetric visualization of continuous anatomical motions. We evaluate VolMoVis on both 4D digital phantoms and real patient datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate anatomical reconstruction and motion tracking. Furthermore, we highlight its capabilities in real-time simultaneous volume generation and tumor segmentation for visualizing dynamic volumes and 4D tumor tracking, showcasing its potential in image-guided radiation therapy"

    "abstract": "In wireless communications with high mobility, an interpolation-based channel estimation scheme shows the feasibility of windowed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) is mitigated by a wrap-around based frequency-varying Viterbi detection scheme. In the interpolation-based channel estimation, insertion of pilot and null subcarriers leads to a decrease in available spectral rate. To reduce null subcarriers and thus improve available spectral rate, we propose an iterative channel estimation and signal decoding scheme, which mitigates the ICI introduced by reduction of null subcarriers. In the proposed iterative scheme, an initial coarse channel estimation procedure is conducted before the iterative channel estimation and signal decoding procedure. Two procedures are skillfully designed to prevent error propagation. Furthermore, the properties of raised-cosine roll-off window function are exploited to design the proposed scheme, where repetition data transmissions are proposed to safeguard against decoding errors. Simulation results demonstrate that the available spectral rate increases at the price of tolerable performance degradation."

Three states of hovering, low-speed forward flight and high-speed forward flight, the noise composition, directivity and frequency domain characteristics of the coupling between the isolated parts and the whole aircraft were analyzed, respectively. The results show that during hovering, propeller noise is the primary component, with vortex shedding at the blade tips concentrating at the bottom of the fuselage to form intense interference, reaching a peak of 105 dB; during the low-speed forward flight phase, rotor vortices are the main source of interference noise, peaking at 104 dB near the lower side of the rotor disk plane on the forward side; in high-speed forward flight, rotor noise remains the dominant factor, with reduced interference from various components but increased sound source concentration, also located below the forward side away from the rotor disk plane, reaching a peak of 106 dB."

This enhancement improves resilience to packet loss while preserving the original Go-Back-N strategy to avoid the complexity of packet reordering on the transmitter side. We compare the performance of both versions in a multi-hop scenario, using emulated acoustic modems, in terms of the time required for successful file transfer under increasing packet error rates, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our optimized approach in challenging underwater communication conditions.

Traditional forecasting methods struggle with the fluctuation and uncertainty of renewable energy as it becomes more popular. Capturing complex data patterns, handling non-linear relationships, and responding to rapid environmental changes are these issues. This work suggests power forecasting using sophisticated deep learning architectures, notably the convolutional neural networkrecurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) model, to address these issues. This hybrid approach enhances prediction accuracy by combining convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for processing sequential data. Historical power generation data of Teuton City was used to examine the model. The proposed model results are evaluated and compared with the Xception network and ResNet50 network using mean absolute percentage error, $R^{2}$ score, and training time. The results indicate that the CNN-RNN model achieved a remarkable $R^{2}$ value of 0.99742, along with a low MAPE of 0.0042. It also demonstrated that CNN-RNN requires the least training time of $\\mathbf{1 8. 1 3}$ minutes. In contrast, ResNet50, though highly accurate with an MAPE of 0.00313, required longer training times. The findings indicate that the proposed CNNRNN model efficiently addresses the complexities of power forecasting while providing a computationally economical solution, positioning it as a promising prospect for future applications in the renewable energy sector."

    "abstract": "Matrix multiplication over the real field constitutes a foundational operation in the training of deep learning models, serving as a computational cornerstone for both forward and backward propagation processes. However, the presence of silent data corruption (SDC) in large-scale distributed training environments poses a significant threat to model convergence and predictive accuracy, particularly when such errors manifest during matrix multiplication. Due to their transient and non-intrusive nature, these errors often evade detection, allowing them to propagate and accumulate over time, ultimately leading to substantial degradation in model performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel error-correcting coding framework specifically tailored for matrix multiplication operations. Our proposed framework is designed to detect and correct multiple computational errors that may arise during the execution of matrix products. By leveraging a grid-based structural encoding scheme, our approach enhances error localization and correction capabilities across all participating matrices, thereby significantly improving the fault tolerance of the computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves deterministic correction of up to two erroneous symbols distributed across three matrices with 100% reliability, while incurring only a 24% overhead in computational time on GPU architectures. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the error-correction properties inherent to our coding scheme, establishing its correctness and robustness under well-defined fault models."

First, 5 wt% n-butanol was added during the HMPF fabrication process, and the preparation procedure was improved, enhancing fabrication efficiency while reducing material waste. The HMPF's acoustic recognition capability was validated through dynamic acoustic sensing experiments in flow fields. Experimental results demonstrate that within the 55–1350 Hz frequency range, the HMPF can discriminate acoustic signals of different frequencies. Wind tunnel tests verified HMPF's dual capability to simultaneously detect airflow parameters (velocity/direction) and acoustic signals. Under multi-directional airflow disturbances, the sensor's output signals exhibited an “8”-shaped relationship relative to the incident flow angle, confirming its dynamic response in flow fields with broad engineering application prospects."

Next, the influence of changes in the rudder angle of the cavitation device on the hydrodynamic delay characteristics was analyzed. The research results indicate that the designed control law for a cavitation device has achieved the “snake like” maneuvering process of a supercavitating vehicle. The maximum bag depth of the vehicle during this process was 0.75 meters, and the maximum horizontal displacement reached 25 meters. The tail flapping mode of the vehicle changes with the change of rudder angle. During the “lowering” motion stage, it is mainly a double-sided tail flapping motion, and during the “raising” motion stage, it is mainly a single-sided tail flapping motion. The lift of the vehicle has significant delay characteristics, and the delay time of fluid dynamics varies with changes in rudder angle and rotational speed, and is asymmetrically distributed during the tail beat period."

We present three bounds derived under our framework using Rényi, Hellinger p and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover to the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous $\\log (2\\sqrt n )/n$ slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter bounds. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic phased array detection signals are often mixed with experimental noise, making it difficult to ensure the accuracy of defect quantification. Traditional noise reduction methods for one-dimensional signal such as wavelet thresholding and modal decomposition rely on prior knowledge to determine parameters. Unsupervised noise reduction methods like autoencoders can remove noise to some extent through encoding and decoding structures, but are prone to over-denoising. A noise reduction model based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and autoencoder feature fusion is proposed. The signal is initially denoised by low-pass filtering and then 1D CNN is used to extract features from the denoised signal. The feature results are fused with the denoised output of the autoencoder to achieve final signal denoising. To adaptively enhance important signal channels weights, an attention mechanism is embedded in the 1D CNN. The results show that for 1D signal denoising, the 1D CNN-autoencoder with attention mechanism outperforms the traditional autoencoder and 1D CNN-autoencoder, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 5.02 dB and 0.56 dB respectively.

Due to its excellent ductility, NEPE propellant can withstand large deformation loads. The mesoscopic damage significantly influences macroscopic mechanical properties of propellants, therefore, revealing the mechanism of mesoscopic structures' evolution under large deformation is crucial for propellant performance design. This study introduces a non-invasive observation methodology leveraging in situ X-ray tomography for tracking mesoscopic damage progression in propellants subjected to large deformation loading.

Traditional approaches, which rely on individual WHOIS queries often suffer from unclear ownership structure of IP addresses and inconsistent organization names, resulting in ambiguous inferences. Alternative methods that map BGP prefixes to Autonomous Systems Numbers (ASNs) and ASNs to organizations are also inaccurate since ASes often originate prefixes on behalf of their customers. This paper introduces Prefix2Org, a comprehensive prefix-to-organization mapping framework. We introduce a taxonomy for the holders of IP addresses and a methodology to map IP addresses to organizations, based on the operational rights over them. We develop string processing heuristics and leverage RPKI Certificates and routing data to address inconsistencies in organizational names and aggregate prefixes under unified management. Our public dataset covers 99.96% (99.99%) of IPv4 (IPv6) prefixes. We validate 9.3% of routed IPv4 addresses with a 99% recall, and 5.6% of IPv6 prefixes with a 99.34% recall. For the two large organizations where we obtained complete ground truth, Prefix2Org produced no false positives. Finally, in two case studies, (i) we characterize organizations that hold address space without an ASN and (ii) demonstrate how RPKI adoption measured through Prefix2Org differs from the previously used AS-centric view."

To fulfill the requirements for parallel communication, this work introduces network coding, which enables relay nodes to perform coding operations while forwarding data. The main work of this paper is as follows: First, this paper proposes an enhanced network coding scheme tailored for the sparse links of UASNs by integrating opportunistic routing with a classical protocol. Second, it proposes a cross-layer scheme called opportunistic routing enhanced network coding (ORENC), optimized for multi-source, multi-destination scenarios, which outperforms conventional opportunistic routing. Both schemes for sensor information exchange are based on a listening mechanism, thereby incurring no additional overhead for the exchange of control information. This approach resolves challenges posed by equitable scheduling within a decentralized protocol. Furthermore, this design effectively addresses the challenges associated with mobility and asynchronous communication in UASNs. The simulation results, based on a network comprising four sources and four destinations, quantify the throughput improvements of our proposed method compared to three well-established benchmark protocols: vector-based forwarding (VBF), depth-based routing (DBR), and focused beam routing (FBR). The improved coding scheme achieves an average throughput gain of approximately 10% over all three benchmarks, while the ORENC protocol demonstrates a more substantial average improvement of 20%."

Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, enables mobile devices to collaboratively learn a shared prediction model while keeping all training data on devices. However, a key obstacle towards practical cross-device FL training is the huge energy consumption, especially for lightweight mobile devices. Prior literature mostly optimizes the convergence speed and network communication cost. In this work, we first perform the experimental analysis of improving FL performance through low-precision training with energy-friendly Digital Signal Processor (DSP) on mobile devices. Then, we demonstrate that directly integrating the state-of-the-art INT8 (8-bit integer) training algorithm and classic FL protocols will significantly degrade the model accuracy.

This work empirically demonstrates that the domain-specific knowledge from MIMO-OFDM systems can be incorporated into RNN by configuring the input and recurrent weights and achieve better MIMO-OFDM detection performance than ESN and traditional RNN trained via backpropagation through time (BPTT), while maintaining low computational complexity suitable for efficient real-time online learning. Our findings show that with increasing training data, BPTT gradually aligns the RNN’s spectral distribution with that of the configured RNN, but saturates thereafter, validating the efficiency of domain-informed weight configuration. Furthermore, to address the issue of increased generalization error as model complexity grows, this paper introduces a two-stage training strategy for the configured RNN, enhancing its generalization capability and reducing error variability across unseen data."

    "abstract": "Electric vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions and advancing sustainable mobility; however, their adoption remains limited in developing countries, creating a clear research gap in understanding the contextual factors that influence user acceptance. This study addresses this gap by proposing an integrated technology adoption model that combines constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and other related frameworks in the context of an emerging country. Data were collected from a sample of 400 individuals in Ecuador and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed that perceived behavioral control and emotions significantly influenced users’ attitudes toward EVs, whereas emotions, social influence, and hyperbolic discounting significantly affected users’ purchase intentions. Conversely, factors such as perceived risks, personal moral norms, and social influence on attitude were not statistically significant, likely due to contextual limitations such as inadequate infrastructure and a lack of policy incentives. These findings provide valuable insights into consumer behavior in emerging economies and contribute to a validated model for predicting EV adoption, with clear implications for policymakers and stakeholders to design effective strategies and incentives to promote sustainable transportation."

    "abstract": "As adversarial attacks become more sophisticated, AI-driven intrusion detection models are increasingly at risk. Adversarial evasion typically originates from data leakage, allowing attackers to infer training data and generate adversarial examples that evade detection. This study proposes a Privacy-Preserving Adversarial Training Framework (PPATF), a robustness-enhancing architecture that combines adversarial transfer learning optimized with differential privacy—to ensure data privacy—and data smoothing techniques—to reduce the sensitivity of both input and output data. Experiments were conducted using LightGBM-based models, trained on the MQTTset and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Model robustness was evaluated under black-box scenarios using Zero Order Optimization and HopSkipJump attacks. To validate practical applicability in constrained environments, both training and inference times were considered. The results confirm that the proposed ensemble framework, which integrates DP-SGD–optimized shadow models with data smoothing, achieves significant gains in robustness while maintaining original performance levels."

The proposed approach simultaneously adjusts the proportional and integral gains of both current control loop and phase-locked loop based on the sampled output current. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for online parameter tuning without relying on theoretical modeling or impedance measurements. First, particle swarm optimization is utilized to iteratively determine near-optimal control parameter combinations on a detailed circuit model. These parameter combinations are then assigned multiple labels for offline training of the AI model. Then, a novel feature-fusion model, combining long short-term memory with artificial neural network, is trained to extract both temporal and global features from the sampled currents so as to fit the target label. Finally, during online implementation, the feature-fusion model is triggered only when the d-axis current deviation exceeds a predefined threshold. Then it will output a label to retrieve control parameters from a lookup table and update the control loops. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an input window width of 10 ms for feature-fusion model, a positive outcome rate of 98.21%, a stability recovery rate of 84.95%, and an average settling time of 61.59 ms. Moreover, the trained feature-fusion model demonstrates strong adaptability to paralleled grid-following inverters operating with different current references."

A kinematic model of the robot and a quasi-static force analysis are used to optimize the design and evaluate its motor requirements. Experiments demonstrate that combining the sprawling mechanism with FBEM enables the DSTAR to both crawl and drive, overcome a wide range of challenging obstacles, and improve its climbing capability by 66% compared to symmetric FBEM designs (such as RSTAR). The robot can crawl and maneuver over rough terrain using its unique turtle-gait method, roll sideways to surmount wall obstacles up to 20 cm high, travel horizontally across uneven ground, and switch between wheels and whegs to adapt to different terrain types, including dirt, stones, and grass.

Despite recent advancements, such as dual branch cross-attention (CA) mechanism, existing methods struggle to differentiate ambiguous emotion categories effectively.

To address these challenges, this article introduces a novel approach, the multimodal spatiotemporal semisupervised transformer (MSST). First, we propose a multimodal spatiotemporal transformer to encode spatial features, capture temporal dynamics, and fuse information from three modalities effectively. Second, a semisupervised learning (SSL) strategy leverages unlabeled data, enhancing robustness against noise and outliers. Last, a two-stage classification strategy and consistency loss are introduced to improve the model’s ability to handle category ambiguity and ensure robust predictions for similar samples. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark GER datasets demonstrate that MSST either considerably outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing GER research and overcoming the limitations of existing approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a model predictive trajectory optimization and control method for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) replacement in close formation flight. When a UAV in close formation fails and needs to be replaced, the replacement UAV must compute a collision-free trajectory to reach the specific relative position previously occupied by the failed UAV. In close formation flight, the replacement UAV must navigate in a densely packed environment, which increases the risk of collision. To reduce this risk, trajectory optimization is performed with constraints that enforce a minimum safe distance between UAVs. However, due to the confined space, the replacement UAV may become trapped in a local minimum during optimization, preventing it from converging to the desired relative position. To address this issue, this paper presents a model predictive trajectory optimization and control method that incorporates a potential field to generate 3D collision-free trajectories that are close to the global optimum for UAV replacement. In addition, a simplified collision avoidance constraint and convergence conditions for UAV replacement are derived. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method ensures trajectory convergence while maintaining stability throughout the replacement process. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) test environment was developed based on 3D robot simulator Gazebo and multiple single-board computers to closely replicate real-world hardware tests. The results of the HITL tests show that the proposed method effectively enables UAV replacement in close formation flight in various scenarios."

    "abstract": "Single-stage inverters are gaining more attention nowadays due to its lesser power conversion stage, which will improve the efficiency. Conventional single-stage inverters are buck-boost derived types, which have the drawbacks of low voltage gain and discontinuous DC input current. Also, to boost the voltage level in single-stage inverters, step-up transformers or coupled inductors are used, which will make the system bulky. So, in this paper, a novel high-gain switched capacitor single-stage inverter is proposed which will utilize only one inductor and a single DC source which is shared in both positive and negative halves of the output AC voltage. This sharing will eliminate mismatch and asymmetry in the AC waveform. Since the duty cycle of the proposed inverter varies in each switching cycle, the linearized state-space averaged model deviates from its performance. To overcome this constraint, a novel low frequency average based model is proposed in this work. A comprehensive mathematical analysis of the proposed inverter is validated with MATLAB simulation and hardware prototype."

    "abstract": "This study introduces case adaptive detection models for detecting asbestos-containing building materials employing short-wave infrared hyperspectral images. The models are optimized for indoor and outdoor conditions, which could be applied to asbestos detection in interior and exterior building materials. Samples were collected from the most probable types and forms of building materials for both asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) and non-asbestos-containing materials (non-ACMs) to represent real-world conditions, utilizing the largest and most diverse dataset to date (11 types, 4 directions, and 4 forms). X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses demonstrated that chrysotile was the main asbestos mineral in the most of ACMs, as evidenced by characteristic chrysotile diffraction peaks, fibrous serpentine morphology, and coincident Mg-Si elemental distributions. The spectral characteristics of building materials are manifested by mineral components for ACMs and non-ACMs, where asbestos absorption (Mg-OH) identifies ACMs. The indoor RF model identified critical absorption features at 2299-2350nm, 1923-1967nm, and 2366-2426nm, corresponding to Mg-OH, OH, and CO₃²⁻ absorptions, achieving 95.3% accuracy. The outdoor RF model incorporated additional Fe-OH and Al-OH bands, achieving 96.5% accuracy. Real-world validation at three asbestos abatement sites and one large-scale site demonstrated practical applicability including scalability and computational efficiency with overall accuracies of 92.1% for indoor and 92.5% for outdoor conditions. Comparative analysis with existing benchmark methodologies confirmed superior performance, with our models significantly outperforming previous approaches. The models successfully detected ACMs across various material conditions, scales and effectively verified complete removal post-abatement with high computational speed. This approach delivers immediate practical value for compliance verification and quality assurance in real-world abatement scenarios and large-scale surveys, providing objective documentation for regulatory compliance while substantially reducing costs compared to conventional destructive sampling methods."

By employing a multimodal model with a joint image and language embedding space, we propose a novel language-guided MSDA approach, termed LanDA, based on optimal transfer theory, which facilitates the transfer of multiple source domains to a new target domain, requiring only a textual description of the target domain without needing even a single target domain image, while retaining task-relevant information. We present extensive experiments across different transfer scenarios using a suite of relevant benchmarks, demonstrating that LanDA outperforms standard fine-tuning and ensemble approaches in both target and source domains."

The DSO first solicits the participation of flexible loads, including EVs and BESSs, which can either accept or reject the request. Considering the agreed state of charge of participating resources, a flexibility market is then formulated, incorporating the user contribution index and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The proposed mechanism is tested under various load conditions, price tariffs, and EV penetration levels. The results demonstrate significant cost reductions for DSOs, as they purchase less energy from the upstream market operator compared to scenarios without flexibility management."

In this work, we explore whether modern learning-based approaches can offer a complementary path forward by revisiting the DPC problem. We propose a data-driven solution in which both the encoder and decoder are parameterized by neural networks. Our proposed model operates without prior knowledge of the state (also referred to as \"interference\"), channel or input statistics, and recovers nonlinear mappings that yield effective interference pre-cancellation.

Traditional healthcare models are reactive, responding to events after they occur rather than predicting and preventing them. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework that leverages patient health records to predict four critical health outcomes for CP patients: emergency department visits, medication needs, diagnostic trends, and procedure requirements. Our approach utilizes deep learning models trained on synthetic FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data from over $\\mathbf{4, 0 0 0 ~ C P}$ patients to create comprehensive patient timelines with rich clinical features. The emergency visit prediction model achieves $97.5 \\%$ AUC on test data, demonstrating strong discrimination between high and lowrisk patients. The multi-label prediction models show varying performance based on dataset size and label frequency, with Top20 models significantly outperforming Top-50 models: medication prediction achieves F1-scores of 0.78 (Top-20) versus 0.19 (Top50), while diagnosis and procedure prediction models achieve 0.72 versus 0.018 (Top-50) and 0.75 versus 0.22 (Top-50) F1scores, respectively. Feature importance analysis reveals that recent healthcare utilization patterns, medication regimens, and diagnostic history are the strongest predictors of emergency care needs. We also present a novel timeline-based feature engineering methodology that captures temporal trends in patient health. Ablation studies demonstrate that the inclusion of derived features, such as healthcare utilization metrics and medication complexity indicators, significantly improves model performance. The framework can assist healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients who would benefit from preventive interventions, potentially reducing emergency visits, improving quality of care, and decreasing healthcare costs. The system’s architecture accommodates continuous learning with new patient data, making it adaptable to evolving clinical patterns and individual patient histories."

Most existing inversion strategies involve arbitrary initial hypotheses, such as filtering techniques, to identify the dominant features in the radar spectrum. That is necessary due to the nonlinearities introduced by tilt and shadow modulations in radar images. In this study, we implement the linearized Least Squares with Regularization (LSQR) approach. This method is based on the first-order linearization of the tilt model, followed by its inversion using least squares techniques: the inversion process is herein addressed towards a high computational efficiency by adopting the Tikhonov method with Cholesky decomposition. The result is the generation of a linear discrete reconstruction characterized by a composition of harmonic components. This approach has been extended to constant noninfinite and discontinuous bathymetry offshore with excellent results for $2 D$ sea wave reconstructions, particularly where the wave elevation can be described as a linear phenomenon (e.g., absence of wave breaking)."

    "abstract": "Accurate trajectory control during the high-speed water entry of trans-media vehicles faces significant challenges due to complex cavitation dynamics and highly nonlinear fluid-structure interactions. This paper proposes a robust underwater trajectory stabilization strategy leveraging a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. First, a computational hydrodynamic model is established using the slicing method: the axisymmetric vehicle geometry is discretized into longitudinal segments, and time-varying wetted regions are dynamically determined by analyzing the geometric interaction between the expanding/contracting cavity and the vehicle surface. This model, integrated with six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body motion equations, enables efficient full-trajectory dynamic simulation from cavity navigation to fully wetted phases. Second, an optimal LQR controller is designed to generate horizontal, vertical, and differential rudder deflection commands. A saturation function explicitly constrains rudder angles within physical actuator limits, ensuring feasible control inputs while achieving stable underwater attitude regulation. Finally, comprehensive simulations validate the controller's performance across diverse entry conditions. Key results demonstrate: Compared to a conventional PID controller, the LQR achieves an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{8 1. 2 9 \\%}$</tex> improvement in the ITAE (Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute Error) metric for depth tracking under high-speed/large-angle entry (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$150 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}, 90^{\\circ}$</tex>), reducing pitch angle convergence time to under 2 seconds.

    "abstract": "This paper shows that projection-aggregation (PA) decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes can decode up to half the minimum distance d efficiently. By generalizing the false vote matrix from 1-dimensional to higher-dimensional subspaces, we prove that projecting onto disjoint subspaces, regardless of their dimensions, provides at most d/2 − 1 false votes for each codeword bit. Thus, d disjoint subspaces guarantee the correction for errors of d/2 − 1 or less. Moreover, the flexibility in subspace dimensions allows projecting into repetition codes directly, resulting in decoding efficiency. Finally, we prove that PA decoding with d disjoint subspaces decodes up to half the minimum distance in $O(n\\sqrt n )$ for RM codes of length n and half rate or less."

This paper proposes a series of best practices and design patterns based on Open Universal Data Definition Language used in Future airborne capability environment, which make the data models easier to design, reuse and understand. Furtherly, using the proposed pattern in data modeling of the onboard warning system demonstrates the feasibility of the data modeling pattern in engineering practice."

    "abstract": "To address the inherent contradiction between maneuverability and impact accuracy during the dive phase of high-speed flight vehicles, a novel maneuver guidance law based on optimal control theory is proposed. Altitude-decaying S-shaped and sine maneuver signals are introduced into the line-of-sight angle to generate spiral and sinusoidal maneuver trajectories, respectively. The amplitude and frequency of these signals are modulated by altitude-dependent decay functions, which enable effective evasive maneuvers during flight while ensuring terminal guidance accuracy through the gradual attenuation of maneuver signals as the vehicle approaches the target. The guidance law is derived using Pontryagin's minimum principle under multiple constraints, including impact point, impact angle, overload, angle of attack, and control authority limits. Simulation results show that compared with non-maneuver optimal guidance, the proposed method significantly enhances vehicle maneuverability under multiple constraints. The average overload is increased to 3.98g and 7.35g for spiral and sine maneuvers, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that both maneuver guidance laws achieve sufficient robustness and accuracy, with miss distances and impact angle errors meeting engineering requirements. Furthermore, the influence of maneuver switching altitude on miss distance is analyzed, and it is revealed that the relationship is nonlinear and depends on the maneuver signal type."

The method adaptively adjusts the watermark bit strength with proper pixel value modification, embedding it into the middle-frequency band of DCT coefficients and selected DWT subbands. The embedding strength is dynamically tuned based on local coefficient magnitudes, ensuring minimal visual distortion while maintaining high resistance to common image processing attacks-particularly filtering, compression, and noise. To improve security and unpredictability-unlike traditional random bit generators with fixed seeds-our proposal uses a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) device, which provides a hardware-rooted source of entropy that is extremely difficult for attackers to predict. This approach dynamically inserts watermark bits, satisfying all core properties of a robust watermarking benchmark. The proposed method is fully blind, and the experimental results show an outstanding Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR $\\gt80 \\mathrm{~dB}$), making our scheme a powerful method in terms of robustness and imperceptibility. Additionally, the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) reaches near-perfect levels, and the Bit Correction Rate $(B C R=100 \\%)$ confirms the method’s efficiency and visual fidelity."

To effectively inform conservation efforts in this degrading environment, this study utilized high-resolution ROV video transects to characterize and map the shallow coastal biocenoses across five areas within its two inlets. Our findings revealed distinct spatial patterns, with Cymodocea nodosa meadows consistently occupying the shallowest depths. Rhodolith beds often present in slightly deeper waters, their absence in specific areas was potentially linked to higher sedimentation rates or lack of neighboring mussel farms. Furthermore, vertical metallic poles, residual from mussel farming activities, emerged as important biodiversity hotspots, while thanatocoenoses highlighted localized presence of active mussel farms. This detailed finescale mapping provides crucial baseline data for understanding coastal habitat heterogeneity, supporting conservation strategies for vulnerable communities and species inhabiting this unique and stressed ecosystem."

This module uses a multi-hole block to realize the system integration of various hydraulic components, eliminating intermediate connection pipes, and has a faster response speed. At the same time, the module uses the self-function of hydraulic system and the internal mechanical structure of hydraulic components to protect the test pieces under the condition of electricity and no electricity, reducing the accidental impact damage to the test pieces. Finally, the performance of the protection module was verified by the test to meet the requirements of aircraft strength test, and can be used in subsequent aircraft strength test."

We derive a minimax theorem applicable to this setting that does not require any finiteness or deterministic policy constraints. Using this theorem, we show that any Bayesian regret bound can be used to bound the minimax regret within our framework. We then apply the minimax theorem to obtain an information-theoretic upper bound for the minimax regret, leveraging a general Bayesian regret bound. The derived minimax regret bound inherits key properties of the Bayesian regret bound, including its ability to isolate factors such as the information ratio, the mutual information between the learning target and the environment, and the Bayesian regret of the target policy. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our bounds in various settings, including linear bandits, episodic reinforcement learning, and linear Markov decision processes, recovering known results for the minimax regret."

Up to the present, abundance indices based on the density of this species are evaluated by visual inspection of underwater imagery and through manual counting of the observed burrows. A novel approach is proposed, based on the integration in the processing pipeline of a supervised learning model in charge of detecting the burrows. The model is trained exploiting underwater videos that experts annotate by identifying the frames where burrows are present and specifying the related features. To pursue such a goal, the proposed automated procedure must cope with several environmental issues, such as high underwater turbidity, uneven illumination, heavy colour distortions, as well as complexities arising from the presence of ambiguous objects and morphological features that may affect the misclassification rate. The proposed method was developed on video material collected in a specific area, but has the potential to be applied throughout the species’ distribution range. Preliminary results concerning the analysis of data captured in the central Adriatic Sea are presented and discussed."

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising method for FVV construction due to its superior reconstruction quality. However, its real-time rendering on untethered HMDs remains challenging due to high computational demands. To address this challenge, we propose EdgeGaussian, a novel edge-client collaborative framework for real-time FVV rendering. Our approach employs decomposed static-dynamic 4D Gaussian splatting (SD-4DGS) to separately reconstruct static and dynamic components of a scene. We further introduce a hybrid mesh-4DGS neural representation, where static components are modeled as textured meshes for local rendering, while dynamic components are offloaded to edge servers as 4DGS. This decomposition significantly reduces the computational burden on the client device while maintaining high rendering quality. Our testbed experiments demonstrate that Edge-Gaussian achieves up to 128 FPS, outperforming state-of-the-art local rendering methods by 4x and edge rendering methods by 5x."

To overcome these limitations, we propose automatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic scenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road street view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms, and a large-scale lane line dataset is constructed to provide a robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line detection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network model is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of lane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane information. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map matching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused with the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service platforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level simulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated with data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of simulation road network generation. It provides reliable data support for urban traffic simulation, autonomous driving navigation, and the development of intelligent transportation systems, offering a novel technical pathway for the automated modeling of large-scale urban road networks."

Conventional artificial muscles typically rely on a single actuation mechanism, limiting functionality. By combining thermo-pneumatic and SMA-based actuation, this actuator achieves cooperative, composite, and antagonistic modes without the use of a pneumatic pump. The cooperative mode utilizes the simultaneous actuation of both mechanisms to increase force and displacement output. The composite mode enables distinct actuation tasks, demonstrated through a soft robotic gripper capable of shape-adaptive grasping. The antagonistic mode exploits the opposing force generation of the two actuation sources by using a vacuum-based thermo-pneumatic actuator, facilitating bidirectional motions without additional bias mechanisms. Experimental evaluations confirmed improved force outputs and controllability under payload conditions with the actuator lifting payloads up to 20 kg. A thermodynamic model was combined with a quasi-static force model to predict the behavior of the actuator. The proposed actuator concept enables pumpless actuation of an actuation with two actuation sources using a single energy input and increases the performance of the actuator versus using a single actuation source while increasing the versatility of the actuator through its various modes of operation."

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning (RSICC) plays a critical role in automated environmental monitoring by generating natural language descriptions that provide intuitive interpretations of changes between bi-temporal remote sensing images. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) static encoding architectures fail to account for scene complexity and semantic diversity during feature extraction, leading to inflexible representation learning; and (2) symmetric computational structures are inherently unsuitable for modeling the asymmetric temporal dependencies inherent in “before-to-after” image pairs. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Asymmetric Encoder (DAE), which introduces two key innovations. First, we design a difference-guided dynamic convolution module that adaptively adjusts convolutional parameters using input-driven scaling factors and offsets, thereby enabling scene-aware intra-image feature enhancement. Second, we develop a Multi-expert Temporal Interaction (METI) module that establishes an asymmetric computational topology: the “after” image branch actively perceives change information relative to the “before” image through three heterogeneous interaction experts, followed by feature fusion. This design allocates greater computational capacity to the “after” image branch while preserving temporal coherence. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-level Feature Aggregator (MFA) that enhances the representation of salient changed regions across multiple scales via an iterative reinforcement mechanism. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark RSICC datasets. We publicly release our code repository at https://github.com/TTXiann/Dynamic-Asymmetric to facilitate future research."

However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization.

    "abstract": "Most tissue optical spectroscopy platforms use a fiber probe for light delivery and collection, while the inconsistent probe-sample contact could induce significant distortions in the measured optical signals, which consequently bring analysis errors. Moreover, it will be practically difficult to use a fiber probe for measurements in some cases such as oral cancer investigations using small animal models. To address the critical challenge, we report a portable, lens-based, optical spectroscopy device capable of quantifying key vascular and metabolic parameters in vivo without probe-sample contact. We combined lenses based diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy into one portable platform to enable multi-parametric functional characterizations of orthotopic tongue cancer models in vivo. We also implemented easy-to-use spectroscopic algorithms with the system for rapid quantification of the key metabolic and vascular parameters on biological tissue models. We then demonstrated our non-contact optical spectroscopy on tissue-mimicking phantoms and in vivo mouse tongue tumor models. Our phantom and in vivo animal studies showed that our non-contact optical spectroscopy, along with spectroscopic algorithms, could quantify the major metabolic and vascular parameters on in vivo tongue tumors with high accuracy. We also captured the diverse metabolic and vascular phenotypes of tongue tumors with different radiation sensitivity. Our new optical spectroscopy implemented with easy-to-use spectroscopic algorithms will provide a non-contact way for rapid and systematic characterizations of biological tissue metabolism and vascular microenvironment in vivo, which may significantly advance head and neck cancer research in the future."

Compared with existing methods, MLPM integrates copula Granger causality analysis with gated recurrent unit to accurately pinpoint root causes of faults within nonlinear dynamic interactions and diverse statistical distributions. Additionally, the proposed MLPM framework incorporates a novel Cauchy-Schwarz statistic and an interval fault location method to facilitate the dynamic monitoring of abnormal system states. Finally, two industrial cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of MLPM."

    "abstract": "Recent foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in monocular depth estimation. However, directly applying these models to Full Surround Monocular Depth Estimation (FSMDE) presents two major challenges: (1) high computational cost, which limits real-time performance, and (2) difficulty in estimating metric-scale depth, as these models are typically trained to predict only relative depth. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge distillation strategy that transfers robust depth knowledge from a foundation model to a lightweight FSMDE network. Our approach leverages a hybrid regression framework combining the knowledge distillation scheme–traditionally used in classification–with a depth binning module to enhance scale consistency. Specifically, we introduce a cross-interaction knowledge distillation scheme that distills the scale-invariant depth bin probabilities of a foundation model into the student network while guiding it to infer metric-scale depth bin centers from ground-truth depth. Furthermore, we propose view-relational knowledge distillation, which encodes structural relationships among adjacent camera views and transfers them to enhance cross-view depth consistency. Experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to conventional supervised methods and existing knowledge distillation approaches. Moreover, our method achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency, meeting real-time requirements."

    "abstract": "Recent research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization has focused on enhancing accuracy by incorporating angle information. However, this requires array antennas on UAVs, which increases costs and reduces flight endurance. To address this, we propose a distributed, collaborative localization method for UAV swarms, integrating Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface(RIS) with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). This method relies solely on inter-UAV ranging and a subset of UAVs equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS). The proposed algorithm improves localization by leveraging inter-UAV ranging, RIS, and GPS-equipped UAVs. After swarm patching, an improved node selection algorithm, based on the Nyström approximation, directs RIS-equipped UAVs to designated areas. The UAV distance matrix is refined using the 3σ Gaussian principle and Rice distribution criteria, while MDS computes relative coordinates within each patch. Simulations show that the algorithm reduces localization error, achieving over 10% improvement using multiple RIS-equipped UAVs. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm reduces GPS-equipped UAV requirements by deploying passive RIS-equipped UAVs, extending swarm operation duration and enhancing localization accuracy."

    "abstract": "Guided image synthesis methods, like SDEdit based on the diffusion model, excel at creating realistic images from user inputs such as stroke paintings. However, existing efforts mainly focus on image quality, often overlooking a key point: the diffusion model represents a data distribution, not individual images. This introduces a low but critical chance of generating images that contradict user intentions, raising ethical concerns. For example, a user inputting a stroke painting with female characteristics might, with some probability, get male faces from SDEdit. To expose this potential vulnerability, we propose the Targeted Attribute Generative Attack (TAGA), whose objective is to force SDEdit to generate data distributions aligned with a specified attribute (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.,</i> targeted attribute like male), without changing the attribute of the input image. Empirical studies reveal that traditional adversarial noise struggles to achieve TAGA, while natural perturbations such as exposure and motion blur can easily influence attributes of the generated images. Inspired by the observation, we design attack method <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FOOLSDEDIT</small> to achieve effective TAGA against SDEdit. It aims to search for an optimized strategy to execute attacks within a weighted graph-based attack architecture, which is formulated to model diverse strategies derived from both exposure and motion blur perturbations. Comprehensive experiments on two commonly used datasets and three social attributes present that <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FOOLSDEDIT</small> forces SDEdit to generate targeted attribute-aware distributions, achieving significantly more effective TAGA than the baselines.

    "abstract": "Manipulating a deformable linear object (DLO) such as wire, cable, and rope is a common yet challenging task due to their high degrees of freedom and complex deformation behaviors, especially in an environment with obstacles. Existing local control methods are efficient but prone to failure in complex scenarios, while precise global planners are computationally intensive and difficult to deploy. This paper presents an efficient, easy-to-deploy framework for collision-free DLO manipulation using mobile manipulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging standard planning tools for high-dimensional DLO manipulation without requiring custom planners or extensive data-driven models. Our approach combines an off-the-shelf global planner with a real-time local controller. The global planner approximates the DLO as a series of rigid links connected by spherical joints, enabling rapid path planning without the need for problem-specific planners or large datasets. The local controller employs control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints, maintain the DLO integrity, prevent overstress, and handle obstacle avoidance. It compensates for modeling inaccuracies by using a state-of-the-art position-based dynamics technique that approximates physical properties like Young’s and shear moduli. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world demonstrations. In complex obstacle scenarios—including tent pole transport, corridor navigation, and tasks requiring varied stiffness—our method achieves a 100% success rate over thousands of trials, with significantly reduced planning times compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments include transportation of a tent pole and a rope using mobile manipulators. We share our ROS-based implementation to facilitate adoption in various applications."

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning-based spatiotemporal fusion (STF) methods for remote sensing images primarily denoise low-frequency features. They neglect the impact of noise in high frequency features, often resulting in fused images with poor visual quality and excessive smoothness. To address this, a two-stage STF network based on wavelet denoising and conditional diffusion enhancement is proposed. Firstly, a dualsparse attention denoising network is designed to process high and low frequency image features via high and low pass filters, respectively, enhancing detail representation. Subsequently, a conditional enhancement network is introduced, using the preliminary fusion results as conditional input to enhance features and iteratively denoise during diffusion stage, thereby improving noise robustness. Finally, Fourier-based frequency domain modulation module is introduced to balance the frequency distributions of the backbone and skip branches within the denoising network, achieving further noise reduction. Extensive experiments on CIA and SW benchmark datasets demonstrate that WDCDiff outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple metrics."

In addition, doping with KH570-TiO₂ enhances the electrical properties of RTV, with maximum increases in surface and volume resistivity of 8.36% and 15.64%, respectively. After simulated cultivation with green algae for 96 hours, the wet flashover voltage of the 5 wt% RTV sample increases by 8.1 kV compared with the pristine RTV.

    "abstract": "Frequency-domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS) has emerged as a critical nondestructive technique for diagnosing the insulation condition of power transformers due to its rapidity and effectiveness. However, variations in testing temperature due to environmental factors significantly affect diagnostic accuracy, posing a key challenge for practical applications. To address this, a multi-polarization relaxation process extraction method based on the first-order differential spectrum of the real part of complex capacitance was proposed. The method divides the frequency range into subbands using differential spectrum features across a broad frequency range, enabling quantitative analysis of the temperature characteristics of various microscopic dielectric processes. Furthermore, the double-well potential model calculates barrier heights, while frequency-temperature characteristics determine correction coefficients for different dielectric components. This allows the reconstruction of frequency-domain dielectric spectra at a standardized temperature. Experimental validation on samples with different temperatures and aging levels demonstrates that the proposed method eliminates deviations in traditional temperature normalization approaches, significantly improving the accuracy of frequency-domain dielectric spectra normalization. Moreover, it provides a reliable theoretical framework for field testing of power transformer insulation conditions."

According to developing requirements of high efficient cooling performance of ramjet combustor heat shield, the heat transfer coefficient distribution on the lower surface of the impingement plate in ramjet combustor was studied by using CFD simulation. Effects of the gap distance, the opening rates of the impingement plate (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sigma=0.5 \\%, 0.6 \\%, 0.7 \\%, 0.8 \\%$</tex>) on the heat transfer characteristics were investigated numerically. The results indicate that the Nusselt distribution on the lower surface on the impingement plate is mainly related to the flow state of upper jet flow, and the distribution of high heat transfer region is affected by the flow space and velocity. The Nusselt number in the regions between the impingement holes along the span-wise direction is the lowest. In the cases of low Reynolds number, low gap distance and small opening rate, the high heat transfer region mainly distributes along the direction of flow, while other cases tend to distribute along the diagonal direction of the impinging hole. As the jet Reynolds number and opening rate increase, the Nusselt number on the surface of impingement plate is enhanced, and the relative growth rate of Nusselt number is more than 180% and 20%, respectively. As the gap distance increases, the heat transfer on the lower surface of the impingement plate tends to decrease, and the relative Nusselt number decrease is less than 37%."

The privatizer ensures the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold. The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach."

The approach characterises the surface and double-bounce scattering mechanisms to calculate Fresnel and Bragg reflection coefficients. A hybrid model uses Stokes parameters to estimate contributions from surface, double-bounce, and volume scattering. Dielectric properties of materials are estimated from polarisation signatures using both Fresnel and Bragg models. Field experiments were conducted on flat, low-vegetation terrain, imaging four plastic objects with the dual-polarimetric UAV SAR. The final version of the paper will involve a scenario with plastic objects in the coastal area and floating plastic objects.

This model has been foundational to writing studies, yet has lacked large-scale computational validation. This paper presents a novel methodology to address this gap. Using 135,178 minute-by-minute observations from 4,618 sessions in the KLiCKe keystroke logging corpus, we first used the Elbow Method to empirically confirm that the optimal number of behavioral clusters is three. We then applied K-Means clustering to partition the data. The resulting three clusters mapped precisely onto the theoretical phases, and provide empirical percentages of time spent in each phase in argumentative writing: Planning (43.5% of writing time), Translating (46.3%), and Revising (10.2%). Post-clustering analysis confirmed that the clusters matched their expected behavioral signatures; for example, the Planning cluster was characterized by extensive pause time (94.7% of the interval), while the Translating cluster was dominated by word production. To our knowledge, this study represents the first large-scale, unsupervised machine learning validation of the Hayes and Flower model, and provides empirical support for a foundational idea in writing theory, and provides a scalable, nonintrusive method for future writing process analysis."

In order to compare the ignition process characteristics between multisector combustors and an annular Combustor, this work, employs numerical simulations to compare the ignition and flame propagation processes in a multi-injector combustor consisting of 3, 5 and 12 swirlers at different inlet temperatures (300 K and 500 K). Firstly, the influence of inlet temperature on flame propagation is analyzed. By tracking the flame leading point, the flame trajectory and azimuthal velocity distribution inside the annular combustor are examined. The results indicate that the flow field in the annular combustor is initially dominated by azimuthal velocity during the early ignition stage. However, one of the sector burners with 5 swirlers failed to ignite at 300 K. The ignition failure occurs because the burner walls reduce recirculation intensity, decreasing both the strength and size of the recirculation zone. This recirculation suppression weakens local fuel-air mixing and ultimately compromises flame stability. Furthermore, the temperature and velocity distributions at different axial heights are studied after the ignition process."

The design of MDP codes has attracted significant attention from the research community. However, only limited attention was given to addressing the complexity of encoding and decoding operations. This paper aims to reduce encoding complexity by constructing partial unit-memory MDP codes with structured and sparse generator matrices. In particular, we present a matrix completion framework that extends a structured superregular matrix (e.g., Cauchy) over a small field to a sparse sliding generator matrix of an MDP code. We show that the proposed construction can reduce the encoding complexity compared to the current state-of-the-art MDP code designs."

This setup is suitable to be employed onboard small vessels in open water sites such as lakes due to compact size and ease of operation of its components. A particular geometry is adopted so that sound waves produced by the source which are reflected by the free surface are added coherently to the direct wave by varying source depth with frequency, enabling propagation conditions at shallow depths equivalent to free-field and simplifying constraints on device handling and positioning. Results are presented of the calibration of autonomous recorders in a lake with approximately 100 m water depth, which prove the method to be reliable for frequencies ranging from 63 Hz up to 20 kHz."

    "abstract": "In recent literature, when modeling for information freshness in remote estimation settings, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators, meaning the remote estimate at any time is equal to the most recently received update. This is mainly due to its simplicity and ease of analysis. However, these martingale estimators are far from optimal in some cases, especially in pull-based update systems. For such systems, maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimum, but can be challenging to analyze. Here, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which retain useful characteristics from a MAP estimate while still being analytically tractable. Our proposed estimators move seamlessly from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator."

FCCs aim to protect the function evaluation of data against errors instead of the data itself, thereby relaxing the redundancy requirements of the code. Later R. Premlal et al. [4] gave new bounds on the optimal redundancy of FCCs and also extensively studied FCCs for linear functions. The notion of FCCs has also been extended to different channels such as symbol-pair read channel over the binary field by Xia et al. [2] and b-symbol read channel over finite fields by A.Singh et al. [3]. In this work, we study FCCs for linear functions for the b-symbol read channel. We provide the Plotkin-like bound on FCCs for b-symbol read channel which reduces to a Plotkin-like bound for FCCs for the symbol-pair read channel when b=2. FCCs reduce to classical Error Correcting Codes (ECCs) when the function is bijective. Analogous to this our bound reduces to the Plotkin-bound for classical ECCs for both the b-symbol and symbol-pair read channels [5], [6] when we consider linear bijective functions."

This study explores the polychaete assemblages’ structure and functional traits along a $\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ k m}$ inshore-offshore transect in the Gulf of Manfredonia (Southern Adriatic Sea), spanning depths from 3 to 423 meters. A total of 28 polychaete taxa were recorded at 31 sampling stations, most of which were low in abundance yet ecologically significant. Multivariate analyses revealed a clear shift in community composition between continental shelf and slope stations, mainly driven by depth gradients rather than sediment type. Eight trophic-functional groups were identified, reflecting a broad range of feeding strategies, motility levels, and substrate interactions. Despite taxonomic differences, the distribution of trophic-functional groups - encompassing a wide range of feeding strategies, mobility, and sediment interactions - remained broadly consistent, indicating functional redundancy. Diverse trophic-functional roles even among rare species suggest a complex and resilient benthic food web. These findings reinforce the ecological relevance of rare polychaete species and advocate for long-term monitoring programs to better capture the dynamics and role of rare benthic fauna. Ultimately, rare polychaetes emerge as sensitive ecological indicators, shedding light on the health of benthic habitats."

The obtained results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces Eve’s decoding ability over the MIMO systems. Therefore, it is effective against passive eavesdropping attacks.

    "abstract": "The error exponent in lossy source coding characterizes the asymptotic decay rate of error probability with respect to blocklength. The Marton’s error exponent provides the theoretically optimal bound on this rate. However, computation methods of the Marton’s error exponent remain underdeveloped due to its formulation as a non-convex optimization problem with limited efficient solvers. While a recent grid search algorithm can compute its inverse function, it incurs prohibitive computational costs from two-dimensional brute-force parameter grid searches. This paper proposes a composite maximization approach that effectively handles both Marton’s error exponent and its inverse function. Through a constraint decoupling technique, the resulting problem formulations admit efficient solvers driven by an alternating maximization algorithm. By fixing one parameter via a one-dimensional line search, the remaining subproblem becomes convex and can be efficiently solved by alternating variable updates, thereby significantly reducing search complexity. Therefore, the global convergence of the algorithm can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments for simple sources and the Ahlswede’s counterexample, demonstrates the superior efficiency of our algorithm in contrast to existing methods."

In this work, we present an information-theoretic framework for two key applications of QPUFs: secret key generation and secure data storage. We rigorously characterize the trade-offs between achievable key and storage rates under various privacy leakage constraints—unconditional, conditional, and zero-leakage—extending classical results into the quantum domain. We derive single-letter capacity expressions based on Holevo information and analyze the impact of shared private randomness on achieving zero privacy leakage.

Many studies have been conducted on porous materials as core materials, for which it is crucial to study rational design methods and the construction of porous structures.

The core pores were generated by secondary development of Abaqus after Monte Carlo random deletion mesh modeling. The effects of the core layers with different porosities, the impactors with different diameters and masses on the low-speed impact behavior of sandwich plates were studied by finite element simulation. The results of simulations show that the larger the core layer porosity is, the smaller the overall stiffness of the sandwich plate is, which proves that the modeling form of porous structure is of practical guidance significance. The larger the impactor diameter, the larger the maximum impact force and the shallower the impact depth. The larger the mass of the impactor, the larger the maximum impact force. The impact depth is independent of the impactor mass and is related to the impact shape and material structure."

In this work, we present the first systematic study of spaceborne event-based space object detection. To address the scarcity of event data, we construct a large-scale dataset named Event-based SPAcecraft Recognition leveraging Knowledge of Space Environment (E-SPARK) by applying affine transformations and advanced event simulators to existing datasets.

Existing methods often focus on extracting discriminative global geographic features. Nevertheless, the substantial appearance variations across different viewpoints can hinder effective localization. Additionally, the consistency between dual-perspective features is frequently overlooked, resulting in mismatches and inaccurate localization. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Supervised Contrastive Orthogonal Fusion framework (SCOF) tailored for cross-view geo-localization. SCOF comprises a Supervised Contrastive Learning Module (SCM) and an Orthogonal Fusion Module (OFM). Supervised Contrastive Learning Module (SCM) leverages semantic labels to enforce consistent feature representations across different perspectives, effectively mitigating the issue of misalignment. The integrated Orthogonal Fusion Module (OFM) extracts orthogonal global components from local features, fostering a synergistic fusion of local and global information for enhanced discriminative capability. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets (University-1652, SUES-200 and DenseUAV) demonstrate that SCOF achieves state-of-the-art performance in drone-view target localization and drone navigation tasks, surpassing existing approaches in accuracy and robustness. By effectively bridging the gap between local and global feature representations while ensuring cross-view consistency, SCOF offers a significant advancement in the field of cross-view geo-localization."

    "abstract": "Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments show that GradMLMD maintains comparable or better performance than MLMD and outperforms existing detectors. Among defenses based on the off-manifold conjecture, GradMLMD presents a novel method for capturing manifold changes and provides a practical solution for real-world application challenges."

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility."

    "abstract": "Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

The proposed filter is named as the hyperbolic tangent Geman-McClure quaternion Kalman filter (HTGMQKF). Two case studies are used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed HTGMQKF. A three-dimensional (3-D) target tracking problem, which considers the process noise with different distributions such as Gaussian, Gaussian-mixture, and Laplacian, while the measurement noise is considered as a Gaussian-mixture distribution. The proposed HTGMQKF performs well for the three types of noise in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and average RMSE (ARMSE). The second case study deals with the filtering of a quaternion signal, in which the proposed HTGMQKF is found to outperform the state-of-the-art quaternion filters."

    "abstract": "Pseudonym certificates play a crucial role in providing authorized access in vehicular networks with fine-grained privacy demands. However, the revocation of pseudonym certificates in large-scale, resource-constrained context has posed a significant challenge. The global revocation status is susceptible to disruption by localized anomalous events. Moreover, as the scale of revocation grows, the synchronization process becomes increasingly vulnerable to attacks and incurs high overhead. To decouple the global revocation status from local revocation events, we propose a spatial-temporal pseudonym revocation and verification framework that supports batch pseudonym revocation within resilient revocation cycles. Revoked pseudonyms within the event area are locally filtered, while other pseudonyms are characterized by maintaining a proof to attest their consistent and legitimate status. To improve the efficiency of revocation status updates and mitigate centralization risks, a distributed caching and proof update strategy assisted by edge nodes is presented. Extensive simulations based on real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that PV-STR scheme significantly reduces the vulnerability window, communication overhead, and memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the joint transceiver design, including pilot transmission, channel feature extraction and feedback, as well as precoding, for low-overhead downlink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems. Although deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in tackling this problem, existing methods often suffer from poor scalability in practical systems, as the solution obtained in the training phase merely works for a fixed feedback capacity and a fixed number of users in the deployment phase. To address this limitation, we propose a novel DL-based framework comprised of choreographed neural networks, which can utilize one training phase to generate all the transceiver solutions used in the deployment phase with varying sizes of feedback codebooks and numbers of users. The proposed framework includes a residual vector-quantized variational autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) for efficient channel feedback and an edge graph attention network (EGAT) for robust multi-user precoding. It can adapt to different feedback capacities by flexibly adjusting the RVQ codebook sizes using the hierarchical codebook structure, and scale with the number of users through a feedback module sharing scheme and the inherent scalability of EGAT. Moreover, a progressive training strategy is proposed to further enhance data transmission performance and generalization capability. Numerical results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superior scalability and performance of our approach over existing methods."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Nearest-State Interleaved Discontinuous PWM (NSIDPWM) strategy for three-parallel interleaved three-phase converters. Prior work in parallel systems has largely targeted reductions of zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) and common-mode voltage (CMV)—often in two-parallel settings and via modified carrier schemes. In contrast, NSIDPWM retains fixed interleaved triangular carriers and applies subsector-dependent dynamic offset voltages to realize Nearest-Three-Vector (NTV) synthesis. A positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence (PNZ) filter is employed to suppress ZSCC, allowing the modulation to prioritize output-current harmonic quality and switching efficiency. The method is evaluated through simulation and experiments against ILPWM, 60DPWM, and EPDPWM. Performance is assessed using a Total Cost Index (TCI) that combines switching loss, total harmonic distortion (THD), and first-sideband magnitude. Results show that NSIDPWM reduces sideband/THD relative to ILPWM and 60DPWM, while avoiding the high switching activity associated with EPDPWM. Although ZSCC may increase modestly, it remains at a few-ampere level and is effectively handled by the PNZ path, whereas output-side harmonics dominate filter sizing. Overall, NSIDPWM achieves a favorable balance between harmonic performance and efficiency without carrier modification, supporting simple, scalable implementation in multi-parallel converter systems."

Additionally, rate-distortion optimization (RDO)-based rate control remains largely unexplored in range image-based LPCC. To address these limitations, we introduce D-Compress, a new framework for detail-preserving, fast, and precise compression of LiDAR range images tailored for real-time streaming. D-Compress focuses on preserving fine-grained range image details while achieving both high compression speed and geometric accuracy. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) codecs, our approach delivers superior geometric precision, high compression ratios, and robust rate control."

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this paradigm by reimplementing three existing applications: RIO [1], Keystub [2], and RF-EATS [3]. Compared to original signal-based implementations, our approach shows significant improvements in accuracy and robustness across diverse environments. Furthermore, By integrating antenna engineering with advanced materials science, we also transform antennas into innovative sensors for pressure, temperature, and UV light sensing. This interdisciplinary methodology pushes the boundaries of battery-free sensing, opening new avenues for IoT applications."

Practical Salinity is obtained traditionally by measuring the electrical conductivity of seawater using appropriately-designed conductivity cells incorporated into submersible probes and other similar instruments or instrument packages. Such cells are usually calibrated to allow salinity to be measured in the $2-42$ range of the Practical salinity Scale of 1978. The MINKE project has been the framework for an interlaboratory comparison of the calibration of a SBE 37 CTD probe at different salinities. The goal was to test the validity of a calibration made with a seawater of salinity 35 when the probe is used in seawater of a different salinity.

The pipeline includes pre-processing, discovery, and post-processing, measuring accuracy via global motif alignment and tracking runtime on uniform hardware.Results highlight a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Weeder achieved the highest accuracy but was prohibitively slow and failed on dense datasets. MEME and MEME-CHIP showed strong performance with long runtimes, while STREME was the fastest but least accurate.

Every node serves a set of users who can request any file in the network. If the requested file is not available at the node, it communicates with other nodes to obtain the file, thus causing the user to experience latency in obtaining the file. The files can be placed uncoded, where each node stores exact copies of the files, or in coded fashion, where certain linear combination of files are placed at each node. We aim to obtain an optimal file placement on the nodes with respect to minimizing the worst-case latency at each node, as well as the system-average latency. The prior literature considered the case of equiprobable file demands at the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the generic case of non-uniform file-demand probabilities at each node. The scheme presented here is optimal within the family of uncoded schemes. It is obtained first by modeling the worst-case latency constraint as a vertex coloring problem, and then converting the system-average latency optimization to a problem of balanced-assignment."

The first approach emerged from the field of network science where multilayer community detection algorithms such as maximizing multilayer modularity or minimizing the normalized cut have been proposed. The second approach emerged from the field of signal processing where tensors have been used to model high-dimensional networks where different low-rank tensor decomposition models are employed to reveal the underlying latent factors. While both research thrusts have provided valuable insight to the topology of brain networks, the equivalencies between the two approaches have not been studied in a systematic fashion up to date. This paper reviews the major community detection approaches for unraveling the topology of multilayer functional connectivity networks from the perspective of both network science and tensor decomposition. We show mathematical equivalencies between different tensor generative models and well-known graph partitioning objective functions. Finding these equivalencies can result in computationally efficient algorithms with optimality guarantees and inform the choice of different design parameters such as the number of communities."

It is well known that some cyclic codes constructed based on finite geometries form a special class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, which perform well under the sum-product algorithm. In this paper, we study the derivative structure of Euclidean geometry (EG) codes, with a special interest in EG-LDPC codes. It is proved that for µ = m −2, the derivative ascendant of the extended (µ,s)th-order EG code of length 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ms</sup> is the extended (µ+1,s)th-order twofold EG code of length 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ms</sup>. As a subcode of EG-LDPC code, the derivative descendant of the extend (1,s)th-order twofold EG code is characterized in terms of the roots of the generator polynomial. The new code relationship suggests that the twofold EG code can leverage the sum-product decoding of the derivative descendant for its derivative decoding."

The main idea is to encode the input subsequence corresponding to each segment using existing one-burst deletion codes, with additional constraints that enable the decoder to identify segment boundaries during the decoding process from the received sequence. The resulting codes achieve redundancy that scales as O(log b), where b is the length of each segment."

For the yaw subsystem's sideslip angle stabilization requirement, a prescribed performance function is designed based on the roll subsystem controller's expectations and sideslip angle amplitude-limiting commands, which guarantees that the sideslip angle in the yaw channel achieves specified tracking accuracy with prescribed performance. For the roll subsystem, a prescribed performance function is integrated with dynamic surface control theory to actively regulate the control performance of roll channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can effectively realize both roll angle tracking performance and sideslip angle stabilization."

    "abstract": "In the context of underwater robotics, the ability to perform efficient and trustworthy coverage of unknown environments is crucial for tasks such as inspection, monitoring, and exploration. This paper presents a novel risk-aware coverage planning framework designed for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which integrates a global planner based on a modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm with a local planner that ensures terrain following and obstacle avoidance. The global planner balances exploration efficiency and environmental risk through adjustable parameters, enabling the generation of informative and safe paths in complex bathymetric scenarios. The local planner leverages potential fields and elastic band optimization to refine the trajectory and adapt to dynamic obstacles and terrain constraints. The framework is validated using realistic underwater maps and performance metrics such as area coverage and risk exposure. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust and adaptive coverage in challenging environments, providing a reliable tool for trustworthy autonomy in subsea operations."

Our paper proposes a hybrid watermarking algorithm that leverages the discrete wavelet transform–QR decomposition–singular value decomposition (DWT-QR-SVD) domain to enhance the resilience of embedded watermarks. The host image is decomposed using an R-level DWT, where three levels are used for small watermarks and one level for large ones. After applying DWT, the LL component is chosen to perform QR decomposition. The R matrix is then performed with SVD to generate S, U, V feature matries. Bit watermark is embedded within the singular values (SVs) of the DWT-QR-SVD transformed coefficients to ensure effective copyright protection. Our proposed method is evaluated under a variety of attacks on images. Experimental results show that the technique delivers superior invisibility and robustness compared to existing approaches."

Unlike prior work, we jointly evaluate detection quality and edge feasibility on the SWaT benchmark, reporting precision/recall/F1 alongside latency, memory, false-alarm rate, and detection delay. Autoencoders deliver the highest F1 ($95.4 \\%$), Isolation Forest offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off ($\\mathbf{2 1 ~ m s}$ latency, $\\mathbf{6 5 ~ M B}$), and clustering provides ultra-lightweight early warnings.

However, for newly deployed systems, the lack of sufficient abnormal log data poses a challenge for training effective anomaly detection models. In this study, we propose a framework, named LogADA (Log Anomaly Detection with Augmentation and Transformer-based Discriminative Autoencoder), which leverages prior knowledge from a source system to deploy a model in a new target system. This is achieved by training a transformer-based discriminative autoencoder to create a normal embedding space that is invariant across systems, making it applicable to the target system. Our proposed approach augments labeled data in the target system using the TMix algorithm, which we adapt for log sequence levels. The proposed framework demonstrates effective performance in real-world scenarios, when we have limited abnormal log from the newly deployed target system. Experimental results show that LogADA outperforms several baseline and cross-system methods, highlighting its potential for practical deployment."

This result, combined with the work by Dalai [1] and the recent ones by Renes [2] and Li and Yang [3], implies that the ensemble distribution of error exponents concentrates around the CQ RCE in the high rate regime. Moreover, in the same rate regime the threshold we derive coincides with the ensemble-average of the exponent, that is, the typical random coding (TRC) exponent [4]."

DragonFly demonstrated the feasibility of accurate 3D localization using mmWave tags and a single commercial MIMO radar. However, in dynamic conditions, elevation estimates are often corrupted by outliers, especially during rapid accelerations(mostly due to vibrations) that exceed the system's maximum unambiguous radial acceleration threshold. To address this issue, we propose a novel correction framework that leverages a hypothesis testing procedure to detect and correct elevation outliers. The method tracks multiple candidate elevation trajectories over time, detects inconsistencies using a zig-zag pattern analysis, and resolves ambiguity through a likelihood ratio test based on elevation velocities modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Experiments conducted in highly cluttered environments with drones and mobile tags demonstrate that our method reliably aligns radar estimates with ground truth, successfully correcting 100% of outliers in the evaluated datasets."

Prior work has shown that third-party scripts embedded in the main frame can access and exfiltrate first-party cookies—including those set by other third-party scripts. However, existing browser security mechanisms such as the Same-Origin Policy (SOP), Content Security Policy (CSP), and third-party storage partitioning do not prevent cross-domain access to first-party cookies in the main frame. While recent studies have begun to highlight this issue, there remains a lack of comprehensive measurement and practical defenses. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale measurement and analysis of cross-domain access to first-party cookies in the main frame for 20,000 websites. We find that 56% of the websites include third-party scripts that exfiltrate first-party cookies that they did not originally set, and 32% where such scripts overwrite or delete these first-party cookies. To mitigate potential confidentiality and integrity risks due to this lack of isolation, we propose CookieGuard, a browser-based runtime mechanism to isolate first-party cookies on a per-script-origin basis. CookieGuard blocks unauthorized cross-domain cookie operations while preserving site functionality, with only 3% of the tested websites being affected by Single Sign-On (SSO) breakage. Our work highlights the risks posed by the lack of first-party cookie isolation in the current browser security model and offers a deployable path toward stronger protection."

    "abstract": "Electronic waste (E-waste) is an escalating global challenge, with discarded laptops forming a major share of this growing environmental burden. To support sustainable consumption and informed consumer decision making, this study proposes an unsupervised deep learning framework that ranks refurbished and new laptop brands based on consumer sentiment extracted from online reviews. The framework identifies not only direct product features called aspects (such as battery, display, or customer support) but also experiential dimensions (such as reliability, performance, or overall satisfaction), providing a holistic view of consumer perception. By leveraging a transformer-based multi-headed attention mechanism and part-of-speech tagging, the model extracts rich five-part sentiment structures: Aspect/Dimension, Category, Opinion, Irrealis (hypotheticals), and Sentiment, collectively represented as ACOIS and DCOIS quintuples. These insights feed into a folksonomy-based consumer brand ranking (CBR) algorithm, which aggregates sentiment scores to rank laptop brands effectively. Unlike traditional models, this framework requires no labeled training data, increasing its adaptability across domains. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrate superior performance with F1 score improvements of 9%, 6%, and 4% in extracting product aspects, dimensions, and opinions, respectively. The model is applied to a curated dataset comprising new and refurbished laptops within the same price segment. Results show that 40% of refurbished brands appear in the top 25% of recommendations. We ensured the framework's robustness check, including McNemar's statistical testing on 6 subtasks (5/6 above 0.05 threshold), ablation studies with 2 alternative attention mechanisms, and validation against 14 benchmark methods, confirming framework's stability."

However, the data rate of LoRa is too low to satisfy the requirements of Internet of Things applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel high-data-rate LoRa scheme based on the spreading factor index (SFI). In the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme, the starting frequency bin of a chirp signal is used to transmit information bits, while the combinations of spreading factors are exploited as a set of indices to convey additional information bits. Moreover, the theoretical symbol error rate, data rate, transmission throughput, complexity and energy efficiency of the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme are carefully analyzed. Simulation results not only verify the accuracy of our theoretical analysis, but also demonstrate that the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme can improve the transmission throughput of existing LoRa schemes without sacrificing the BER performance over additive white Gaussian noise, Rayleigh fading, and multipath flat-fading channels. Therefore, the proposed SFI-LoRa scheme is a potential solution for applications requiring a high data rate in the LPWAN domain."

    "abstract": "In the field of remote sensing image processing, remote sensing image object detection is a crucial undertaking. However, the existing target detection algorithms have a considerable number of model parameters, which results in a slow detection speed that is not conducive to application deployment and real-time detection. Additionally, due to the background complexity of remote sensing images and the large number of small target objects, the performance of existing algorithmic models applied directly with remote sensing images is unsatisfactory. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight architecture based on YOLOv8: AUD-YOLO. In particular, a convolution module, GEConv, based on improved efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), is proposed to replace the original ordinary convolution at the end of the backbone part. This can enhance the accuracy of target detection in remote sensing images while maintaining a lightweight operation. The utilization of dynamic upsampling operators serves to perform upsampling operations with greater accuracy and to more effectively extract image features pertaining to small target objects. Finally, the issue of sample imbalance is addressed by utilising Wise-iou as the position coordinate loss function of the neural network. In the experiments, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method using the public remote sensing datasets NWPU VHR-10 and DIOR. The experimental results demonstrate that the AUD-YOLO model proposed in this paper achieves mAP values of 91.1% and 82.7%, which are 1.6% and 1.5% higher than the mAP indexes of the baseline model, and the number of parameters is reduced by 4.7% compared with the original model. We comprehensively consider the number of model parameters and model detection accuracy to make the model more adept at detecting remote sensing images."

Therefore, provable data possession with data transfer (DT-PDP) is proposed to enable transferable auditing ability on data integrity for data owners without downloading the data. However, we found that existing solutions either fail to guarantee secure multi-ownership confirmation or, when fixing multi-ownership, fail to enable scalable and efficient ownership transfer for group transactions. Even worse, during transactions, they leak secret keys to untrusted entities, leading to integrity audit failures for untransacted data. To address primary conflict between fixed ownership distribution and the dynamic nature of group members, and potential collusion attacks due to untrusted entities during transactions. In this paper, we propose a scalable cloud auditing with efficient ownership transfer for group transactions. Specifically, by refining data transaction framework and carefully elaborating tag design in data integrity auditing, we allow 1) partial ownership transfer without disturbing others, if any remaining, inside the group; and 2) efficient ownership transfer between two totally different groups. Additionally, to prevent the risk of key leakage during data transactions, we have incorporated a random mask to maintain the integrity of the audit. The security analysis and evaluations justify the security level and practicality of our design."

However, the interaction with the environment could be unpredictable, which requires the robots to be equipped with the ability of environment perception. This article presents a junction tensegrity robot (JTBot), which consists of both flexible and rigid struts, for the inspection of unstructured pipelines. Slender elastic beams are utilized to replace the rigid rods to enhance the robot’s dexterity and flexibility by generating large-scale deformations. Compact deflection sensors are embedded onto the flexible struts to enable the JTBot with the capability to estimate its equilibrium state and to predict the contact conditions with the environment. A closed-form model of the robot’s kinetostatics is established to characterize the interaction behavior of such a cable-constrained flexible mechanism efficiently. Hence, in situ gait optimization can be implemented for the crawling robot with the aid of the intrinsic environmental perception. A prototype of the JTBot is developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design, on which a variety of validation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the developed JTBot is able to pass through complex pipelines in a dexterous way. In addition, a demonstration is provided to illustrate the JTBot’s capability of defect detection in unstructured pipelines."

    "abstract": "A combined experimental and model-based methodology is proposed for characterizing thermal properties of electric machine components, integrating assembly-level measurements, inverse modeling, and uncertainty quantification. Unlike traditional approaches, the method applies sensor weighting and assesses parameter identifiability, supporting improved measurement design. The methodology is demonstrated by quantifying maximum current density of five wire types—rectangular copper and aluminum, thick and thin stranded, and litz wires—using motorette setups. The proposed methodology minimizes the weighted mean absolute error between model and experiment across all motorettes from 12.9 °C (literature properties) to 1.2 °C. Global uncertainty analysis reveals limited identifiability of core axial conductivity and winding–wedge interface resistance. Current densities, including skin and proximity effects, are simulated using fitted thermal properties. At low frequency, copper rectangular wires perform best (8.9 A/mm²), followed by aluminum (6.9 A/mm²), stranded thick (6.3 A/mm²), and stranded thin and litz wires (6.2 A/mm²). At 1 kHz, stranded thin and litz wires perform best (6.2 A/mm²), while aluminum rectangular (4.8 A/mm²), copper rectangular (4.2 A/mm²), and stranded thick wires (3.9 A/mm²) show reduced performance. Using literature thermal properties yields 1–13% lower current densities. These results validate the methodology and highlight its value for uncertainty-aware thermal characterization, sensor placement, and quantitative electromagnetic–thermal wire performance assessment in machine design."

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction is a cornerstone for creating immersive digital experiences in metaverse. Owing to explicit scene representation and efficient rendering, Gaussian splatting (GS) has become a prominent research focus in 3D reconstruction. However, the input images for GS are often imperfect, as those collected via highly-interfered wireless environment (HIWE) tend to be distorted, thereby undermining the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and limiting scalability. This paper proposes a novel Gaussian semantic splatting (GSS) scheme, designed for agile, reliable, and communication-efficient 3D reconstruction in the metaverse. Specifically, the semantic communication encoder/decoder (SCED) within GSS performs sequential semantic encoding and channel encoding using the proposed reliable and efficient semantic communication (RESC) algorithm, enabling the receiver to recover images with near-perfect accuracy. These images are then processed by the memory-efficient Gaussian renderer (MEGR), which employs an agile Gaussian splatting rendering (AGSR) algorithm to complete the 3D reconstruction and render a series of new viewpoint images. Additionally, a semantic control unit (SCU) is designed to oversee the components, enhancing the overall efficiency of the 3D reconstruction process. Experimental results demonstrate that GSS achieves competitive 3D reconstruction quality in HIWE, delivering real-time rendering speeds of 145 FPS at an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$800\\times 800$</tex-math></inline-formula> resolution while reducing storage memory overhead by more than 12 times compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scheme."

    "abstract": "Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems are valued for their interpretability and flexibility, yet scaling them to high-dimensional data remains challenging. On the antecedent side, computing firing strengths with the product T-norm often results in ineffective activations, undermining rule utilization. On the consequent side, classical least-squares and gradient-based training may generalize poorly without additional regularization. Thus, an efficient and effective training algorithm is required to strike a balance between generalization and precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose a high-dimensional adaptive uniform membership function (HDAUMF) that adapts the width parameter using a theoretically motivated lower bound on the Gaussian width. By incorporating an activation radius to regulate the activation distribution, HDAUMF improves the effectiveness of rule activation. Building on this, a variant of the Kaczmarz method is extended to learn consequent weights of multioutput TSK models, which is further enhanced by a dual residual strategy to accelerate convergence. To mitigate the computational burden of matrix operations, a partitioned update scheme is designed, giving rise to the dual residual iterated projection (DRIP) algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that convergence under the dual residual strategy yields the minimum-norm least-squares solution, thereby supporting robust generalization. Combining these advancements, a novel iterated projection TSK fuzzy system (IPTSK) is developed. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed methods achieve competitive performance in tackling high-dimensional problems."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of excessive control effort in uncertainty compensation to achieve agile and accurate formation control in unmanned aerial vehicle swarm systems (UAVSS). Specifically, we optimize control parameters based on uncertainty information characterized by fuzzy set theory. We propose an adaptive robust agile and accurate formation control (ARAAFC) approach with optimality, developed in two steps. First, agile and accurate formation constraints under uncertainty are enforced through an adaptive robust control design with a tunable parameter structure, ensuring deterministic performance for UAVSS, in terms of uniform boundedness and ultimate uniform boundedness. Second, fuzzy optimality of tunable control parameters is performed by solving a two-players Nash game, which optimizes control effort while ensuring agile and accurate formation performance. The existence of the Nash equilibrium is theoretically proven, and the procedure for obtaining the Nash equilibrium is provided. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed ARAAFC are validated by rigorous proofs and simulations."

When positioned near AC power lines, the PEH converts oscillating magnetic fields into mechanical vibrations of the beam, which are then transformed into usable electrical power. The lead-free PEH is optimized and characterized in terms of impedance and loading, maximum tensile stress, coupling, and temperature stability. An experimental analysis is then performed to optimize the relative positioning of the PEH for a single-phase AC cable.

Subsequently, the PEH is used to power an electronic board capable of transmitting data payloads via LoRa communication technology. This approach opens new possibilities for powering various sensors, enabling real-time environmental data collection and wireless transmission on infrastructures without sectioning multi-wire electrical cables."

To solve the CTTL path planning problem, we propose an efficient integer linear programming-based method to encode task satisfaction. We show that our approach is both sound and complete, while achieving higher efficiency than direct encodings of such requirements. Moreover, we study several variants of the problem. To validate our results, we present several numerical experiments to show the scalability of the proposed approach and a simulation case study of a team of autonomous robots to illustrate the feasibility of the synthesis procedure. Finally, to evaluate the real-world feasibility of our method, we conduct a hardware experiment with two Turtlebot3-Burger mobile robots."

However, the reliability performance evaluation of the scheduling tasks quantitatively are not performed yet. In order to tackle this problem, a Phased Mission System (PMS) modeling methodology is proposed to describe the tasks as several consecutive phases, which enables quantitative evaluation of each phase with heterogeneous configurations among phases. In the paper, the work flow inside a marshalling station is analyzed first. Then the fault tree models of different phases are constructed considering the functional relation of subsystems and equipment. The numerical analysis is carried out based on the Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) calculation method, according to relevant reliability parameters of the basic equipment. A case study is conducted to illustrate the evaluation process with a marshalling station layout from both local railway administration and marshalling station view. The result shows that the number of outdoor equipment have big influence to the scheduling tasks and the fault tolerant design helps to improve the performance during phases."

    "abstract": "Assessing oil spill propagation in port terminals is crucial for environmental protection. The dynamics of an oil spill are related to several factors, including the type of oil, volume, spill points, prevailing hydrodynamics and environmental conditions, oil trajectory and fate, and the geographical zone of potential impact. A system that enables the rapid monitoring and prediction of oil spill propagation is crucial for addressing incidents quickly and effectively. Stochastic or numerical model approaches can be used. In this sense, implementing technologies that predict the port facilities involved in the propagation of an oil spill can improve future response capabilities to incidents. The primary objective of this work is to utilise Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address oil spills and improve detection, prediction, and response capabilities, leveraging their ability to analyse large amounts of data and recognise complex patterns. As a case study, this research focuses on the Port of Augusta (Sicily, Italy), one of the most important ports in Italy. Results revealed that using too few training simulations (e.g., 1,000) led to underfitting, while overly complex networks with too many neurons per layer resulted in overfitting and reduced performance. The optimal balance was achieved with 15 neurons per hidden layer and 9,000 training samples, yielding low RMSE values on unseen data and performance comparable to that of larger datasets. This indicates that computational efficiency can be improved without sacrificing accuracy, highlighting the robustness of machine learning approaches for modelling complex coastal phenomena, such as oil spill dispersion."

This work presents a method to enhance situational awareness in Marine Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) equipped with multi-sensor perception systems through the late-fusion of data from RGB cameras and LiDAR sensors. The RGB camera data is processed using a pre-trained YOLOv8 object detector. LiDAR data is processed through a clustering-based detection pipeline and each detection is classified using a trained Random Forest Classifier. Multi-modal detection and classification are used to confirm the presence of a moving obstacle, whose position, obtained from the LiDAR sensor, is tracked over time using a Global Nearest Neighbour tracking algorithm based on a Linear Kalman Filter. The presented sensor fusion approach enhances object detection and classification, thereby improving situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in autonomous systems. Each step of the pipeline is explained in detail, and the system is validated on real data recorded in a harbor."

In this setting, the transmitter also functions as a radar receiver, aiming to simultaneously transmit a message over the channel and estimate the channel state from the backscattered feedback signals. We show that the fundamental limits of the closed loop system are the same as of the open-loop system where the transmitter can use the feedback signal to estimate the state but not to produce adaptive channel inputs. This result holds as long as the sum of the admissible-average-decoding-error-probability, denoted ϵ, and the admissible-excess-distortion-probability, denoted δ, is below 1, i.e., δ + ϵ < 1."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a robust pinching antenna-based scheme for ensuring secure wireless communication systems is proposed. In the presence of several malicious eavesdroppers targeting the legitimate signal of various genuine users, the designed approach exploits the spatial flexibility of a pinchingantennas system (PAS) composed of several waveguides and pinching antennas to provide secure communication to legitimate nodes. In particular, multiple pinching antennas can be positioned in each waveguide spanning a long distance, providing additional degrees of freedom and flexibility to adjust the channel response with respect to the various users and eavesdroppers. By virtue of semidefinite programming, an optimization problem aiming at optimizing the transmit beamforming to minimize the total transmit power, subject to secrecy constraints, is formulated and solved. The obtained results demonstrate the total transmit power reduction by increasing the number of antennas and waveguides subject to the same secrecy constraints. Furthermore, the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark one, consisting of an array of co-located transmit antennas at the base station, when either a direct link from the latter to the users is blocked or when the eavesdroppers are located in the line of sight of the legitimate users."

This study investigates ice fragmentation and impact loads during vehicle emergence through floating ice, using a numerical method based on the ALE and penalty function contact algorithms to model the coupled interaction of ice, vehicle, and water. Simulations explore various launch speeds, ice densities, and impact location. Results indicate the process comprises three stages, dominated by hydrodynamic and collision forces, peaking at 1400 kN and 2600 kN, respectively. Higher launch speeds lead to slower velocity decay, with only 5.98% reduction at 50 m/s. Increased ice density raises both force types, with collision forces about half of hydrodynamic ones. Impacting the ice center causes the highest forces and velocity loss; off-center impacts reduce attenuation from 11.44% to 4.18%. These findings offer theoretical and technical insights for underwater launches in polar regions."

As such, it is important to evaluate the species dietary composition to estimate eventual ecological and economic impacts, yet traditional stomach content analysis is often limited in detecting digested and/or softbodied prey. In this study, we developed a protocol and employed a high-resolution DNA metabarcoding approach using COI PacBio-barcoded primers to characterize the diet of C. sapidus from different sites across Apulia, Italy. While most stomachs were found to be empty or contained insufficient material for analysis, intestinal contents provided reliable DNA for downstream processing. Amplification of the mitochondrial cox1 gene was technically successful; however, a high proportion of sequences were of bacterial origin, and few metazoan prey taxa were detected, suggesting that the chosen gene may have limited efficacy in faecal samples due to microbial dominance and/or degraded prey DNA. Nonetheless, taxonomic analysis revealed several prey taxa, including other non-native crab Dyspanopeus sayi. Findings of the present study suggest that PacBio long-read sequencing on faecal samples could represent an efficient methodology, but it should be used in conjunction with optimized extraction procedures and molecular workflows designed to reduce host and microbial DNA dominance."

However, these systems often do not work well because the training dataset is imbalanced which attack samples make up only a small part of the dataset, while normal samples are much more common. We suggest a method that combines the data generation ability of Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN) and the data reduction ability of K-Means to solve the data imbalance problem in IDS datasets from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC). Our method first merges well-known datasets like CICIDS2017, CSE-CICIDS2018, CICDDoS2019 and CIC-UNSW-NB15 into one unified dataset. Then, K-Means is used to reduce the number of majority class samples (undersampling), while CTGAN is used to create more minority class samples (oversampling). These are combined to make a balanced dataset, which is used to train and test IDS models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and Graph Convolution Network (GCN). Experimental results show that our balance method CTGAN+K-Means performs much better than traditional balancing methods such as SMOTE and ADASYN."

This approach supports the construction of large, secure, and efficient permutations, suitable for modern frameworks such as Sponge, Duplex, and Farfalle. We analyze the algebraic degree of BLOCKTAIL and show that 9 rounds provide strong resistance against higher-order differential, algebraic, and cube attacks.

    "abstract": "This work presents the results of an experimental campaign carried out off the coast of Livorno (Italy) involving a moored array of Directional Wave Spectra Drifter (DWSD) buoys. The aim was to explore the spatial variability of wave parameters at the scale of numerical wave model grids ($\\mathbf{1. 5 ~ k m}$ spacing), using a $3 \\times 3$ buoy configuration over an area of approximately $9 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$. Each buoy recorded directional spectra at 1 to 3 hour intervals and transmitted data in near real-time via satellite. The deployment, active from November 2022 to April 2023, encountered partial buoy losses but allowed the collection of a unique high-resolution dataset for analysing the spatial coherence and variability of the wave field. The grid configuration was designed to emulate the nodal resolution of operational wave models and to investigate sub-grid variability of key parameters such as significant wave height (Hs), wave period (Tp), and wave direction (Dd). Preliminary analysis highlights strong spatial coherence during swell conditions and more pronounced gradients during mixed or wind-sea events, with implications for the interpretation of in situ data and the quantification of sea-state-dependent uncertainty. Some operational insights are also provided, including lessons learned on mooring stability and data recovery, with brief recommendations for future deployments."

The research framework encompasses three phases: Dynamic modeling and system integration, Controller development and Experimental validation. Firstly, a simplified dynamic model of the transverse tilt bicopter UAV was established through Newton-Euler equations with fundamental flight mechanics assumptions. Subsequent system integration involved V-frame airframe structure design using SolidWorks CAD platform, followed by selection of avionics components and propulsion systems based on performance requirements for full-scale assembly. Then, a cascade PID controller was developed with, Outer-loop, Position regulation (translational control) and Inner-loop, Attitude stabilization (rotational control). The control architecture was implemented through a Simulinkbased mathematical simulation system, enabling PID parameter optimization via numerical analysis. Finally, physical validation included turntable experiments and hovering flight tests under operational conditions. Both simulation and hardware implementation result conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cascade PID control methodology."

We propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing well-established decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after a selected decoder. In essence, we modify the MDP to reduce the number of states, making reinforcement learning algorithms feasible for low-rate and long-length codes. In addition, focusing on the correction of dominant error patterns of a selected decoder improves its error correction capability.

    "abstract": "The development trend of future combat aircraft capabilities represented by airplanes is wide speed range, high stealth ability, high maneuverability, and high energy. The integration of aircraft and engine is a key technology and development trend for future fighter aircraft. It could prevent a situation where “a suitable engine” is installed on “a suitable aircraft,” yet it forms an “unsuitable system.” Aircraft-engine integration is a critical technology and development trend for future fighter aircraft, with its core lying in the integration of aircraft-engine, structure and control. High-speed aircraft afterbodies generate extensive expansion waves/shock waves, leading to shock wave-boundary layer interactions, flow separation, and other complex flow phenomena, which increase the afterbody drag. The Bypass Dual Throat Nozzle (BDTN) constitutes a category of Fluidic Thrust Vectoring Nozzle (FTVN) characterized by fixed geometry. In contrast to conventional fluidic vectoring nozzles, the BDTN employs internal bypass flow to interact with the primary stream, enabling self-adaptive flow control. Symmetric micro holes incorporated within the convergent section of the cavity leverage the pressure gradient between the high-pressure recirculation zone inside the cavity and the low-pressure region near the wall. This differential pressure induces micro-jet formation. These jets effectively compensate for the low-pressure zone and also act as miniature thrust nozzles, contributing additional thrust. Under typical operating conditions, compared to the baseline configuration: The single-hole jet BDTN reduces pressure drag by up to 60.99% and the drag-thrust ratio by up to 43%. The double-hole jet BDTN reduces pressure drag by up to 74% and the drag-thrust ratio by up to 53%."

    "abstract": "There are different types of ice accumulated on aircraft in different environments, which is due to the difference in porosity within the ice. The porosity of ice has a significant effect on the attenuation of the ultrasonic pulse-echo signal, which restricts the detection depth when using ultrasonic pulseecho technology to detect aircraft surface ice. In order to obtain the effective detection range of ice thickness with ultrasonic transducer under different ice types, we studied the effect of ice porosity parameters on ultrasonic echo signal attenuation. First, a transducer-aluminum plate-porous ice structure model was established, and the ultrasonic propagation in multi-layer media and the attenuation characteristics of porous ice were theoretically studied. Then, an ultrasonic icing detection experimental platform in a cold environment was set up. The ice with different pore characteristics was prepared, and the ultrasonic detection signals at different frequencies were recorded. The pore parameters of the impact ice samples obtained by scanning through a microscope were analyzed. After that, the attenuation of the waveforms at different frequencies was analyzed. Finally, the correlation between the attenuation coefficient and frequency was obtained. The experimental results show that the growth of porosity within the ice is directly proportional to the attenuation of the ultrasonic signal at different frequencies; the attenuation coefficients of the ultrasonic signal at the same porosity grow with the growth of the frequency. And the frequency-dependent detection ranges of ice thickness for each ice type are given."

We find that network performance degrades only during unplanned outages, revealing heightened vulnerability during unexpected events. Amateur radio activity shows a weak negative correlation with both planned and unplanned outages, while BGP announcement patterns vary, showing both positive and negative correlations depending on the month. These results show how outage types shape connectivity and give us a deeper insight into the resilience of the Internet in South Africa."

    "abstract": "Various wireless technologies have been utilized for sensing. Although promising, these wireless sensing technologies have inherent limitations. Prior research mainly focuses on overcoming the limitations of an individual wireless sensing technology, and little attention has been paid to the potential benefits of sensing with more than one wireless technology. In this paper, we introduce the concept of cross-technology sensing for the first time, and propose LoFiSen to enable LoRa-to-WiFi sensing. LoFiSen leverages the strengths of both LoRa and WiFi—combining LoRa's long-range capability with WiFi's pervasiveness. The chirp characteristic of LoRa signal significantly improves the sensing range of WiFi, and the widespread availability of WiFi devices makes LoRa sensing more pervasive. LoFiSen is fully compatible with LoRa and WiFi protocols, and can work on commodity LoRa and WiFi hardware. The key component of our design is enabling the WiFi receiver to capture fine-grained LoRa signal variations for sensing. Real-world experiments demonstrate that LoFiSen improves the WiFi sensing range for respiration monitoring from 8 m to 41 m, and pushes the walking sensing range from 16 m to 73.5 m. Through-wall passive respiration monitoring, previously infeasible with state-of-the-art WiFi sensing, is now possible with LoFiSen."

    "abstract": "LoRa-based contact-free wireless sensing has attracted a lot of attention owing to its long sensing range, enabling wide-area sensing for the first time. While promising, existing LoRa sensing assumes there is no communication going on which is usually not true. We observe a severe degradation of sensing performance in real-world settings in the presence of communication. This issue hinders LoRa sensing from being adopted in real life and being integrated into the already established LoRa networking infrastructure. In this paper, we propose LSencom which takes the first step toward making LoRa-based wireless sensing work in the presence of communication. The key design is to employ the reversed chirp, i.e., downchirp, for sensing while keeping the original upchirp for communication. This design smartly leverages the orthogonality between downchirp and upchirp to mitigate the interference between communication and sensing. While the upchirp-downchirp design can remove most of the interference, we further adopt a novel chirp rotation method to deal with the remaining power leakage interference from upchirp to downchirp, enhancing the sensing performance. We implement LSencom on commodity LoRa nodes. Real-world experiments demonstrate that LSencom can reduce the communication-induced interference on sensing by 22.3 dB, and enable LoRa sensing even in the presence of multiple communication links."

We present MetaGuardian, the first system to leverage acoustic metamaterials to defend against three major classes of attacks for VAs - inaudible, adversarial, and laser-based - within a single, portable design. Unlike prior defenses, MetaGuardian can be seamlessly integrated into the enclosures of commercial smart devices, providing strong protection without requiring software modification, hardware redesign, or costly machine learning models. MetaGuardian leverages mutual impedance effects between metamaterial units to extend the protection range to 16–40 kHz, effectively blocking wideband inaudible attacks. It also employs a carefully designed coiled space structure to disrupt adversarial signals while preserving normal VA operations. Its universal design allows flexible adaptation to different devices, striking a balance between portability and protection effectiveness. In controlled evaluations, MetaGuardian achieves a high defense success rate across all attack types, offering a practical and reliable foundation for securing VAs on smart devices."

    "abstract": "The exponential proliferation of user-generated content across online platforms has driven a substantial surge in domain-specific textual data. Consequently, sentiment analysis has emerged to facilitate context-aware, real-time decision making in dynamic, data-intensive domains. Nevertheless, obtaining large-scale annotated data for all domains remains impractical, therefore a necessity for robust cross-domain sentiment classification techniques is still necessary. This work proposes WBiGe a hybrid domain adaptation architecture that combines static and contextual embeddings with a hierarchical BiGRU encoder to exploit semantic structure globally and sentiment cues locally. A lightweight convolutional architecture is used to extract phrase level patterns that are usually ignored by sequential encoders to improve short range sentiment expressions detection. To focus sentiment informative pivots and nonpivots during domain drilldown, a class aware domain alignment mechanism based on weighted maximum mean discrepancy is utilized. Furthermore, an iterative pseudolabeling strategy and dual-level attention modules are incorporated into the architecture to continuously improve target domain prediction to increase the interpretability of the model. The proposed WBiGe framework was extensively assessed using the Amazon benchmark dataset, in which it significantly outperforms the existing models across a wide range of cross-domain classification tasks with a record peak accuracy of 92.75%."

This paper presents a novel, real-time method for early ITSC fault detection in induction motors, applicable to both star and delta winding connections and robust under unbalanced supply voltage (USV) and varying load conditions. The method introduces a new fault indicator, the Negative Admittance Factor (NYF), defined as the ratio of negative to positive sequence admittance components. These components are estimated using the Fortescue transform applied to three-phase current and voltage measurements processed via the Short-Time Least Squares Prony (STLSP) method. Experimental validation on a 1.1 kW induction motor demonstrates the NYF’s effectiveness in detecting even low-severity ITSC faults under diverse operating conditions. The proposed method, implemented in LabVIEW, offers a practical and reliable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of induction motor applications."

The proposed DSP architecture integrates timing recovery, a 5-tap FFE, and a novel single-tap parallel DFE leveraging an 8×8 loop-unrolled structure and a hardware-friendly error-based tap update mechanism thus effectively reduces processing complexity and clock delay. The implementation occupies only 4.2% LUTs, 2.75% FFs, and 6.8% DSP48E2 resources of a Xilinx XCVU13P chip.

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency and minimization of redundant transmissions are critical challenges in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), especially in heterogeneous IoT environments where sensor nodes (SNs) are resource-constrained and deployed in remote or inaccessible areas. This paper aims to address the dual problem of uneven energy distribution and limited network lifespan by proposing a novel Artificial Protozoa Optimizer-based Cluster Head Selection (APO-CHS) algorithm. The proposed APO-CHS is inspired by the adaptive behavior of Euglena, integrating foraging, dormancy, and reproduction mechanisms to optimize cluster head and relay node selection through a multi-objective fitness function. The function incorporates residual energy, node density, neighbor distance, and energy consumption rate to guide the selection process effectively. Additionally, to tackle communication inefficiency, a lightweight data aggregation scheme is employed. This scheme reduces redundant transmissions by introducing a multi-level aggregation model that eliminates full, partial, and duplicate data in both intra-and inter-cluster communication. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves network stability by 29.24%, extends network lifetime by 283.96%, and increases throughput by over 60% compared to baseline methods, thus making it a highly efficient and scalable solution for energy-aware IoT-enabled WSN applications."

A graph convolutional network is used to extract environmental information necessary for restoring the distribution system. The extracted features are then utilized in a deep Q-network to give a better comprehension of massive graph-structured data and the status of automatic switches. Furthermore, service zone features derived from graph convolutional layers over the distribution network topology are used to develop an optimal switching strategy for network restoration using deep reinforcement learning.

However, existing explainable AI (XAI) methods for LLMs primarily rely on word-level explanations, which are often computationally inefficient and misaligned with human reasoning processes. Moreover, these methods often treat explanation as a one-time output, overlooking its inherently interactive and iterative nature. In this paper, we present LLM Analyzer, an interactive visualization system that addresses these limitations by enabling intuitive and efficient exploration of LLM behaviors through counterfactual analysis. Our system features a novel algorithm that generates fluent and semantically meaningful counterfactuals via targeted removal and replacement operations at user-defined levels of granularity. These counterfactuals are used to compute feature attribution scores, which are then integrated with concrete examples in a table-based visualization, supporting dynamic analysis of model behavior. A user study with LLM practitioners and interviews with experts demonstrate the system's usability and effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of involving humans in the explanation process as active participants rather than passive recipients."

We discuss the challenges in the adoption of specific observational strategies and calibration procedures, in particular for the use of results to support policies that impact on the maritime traffic.

    "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used in aerospace due to their superior mechanical properties, including high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, which significantly enhance aircraft performance and fuel efficiency. However, the increasing complexity of their composition-such as diverse fiber types, matrix materials, and hierarchical structures-along with more intricate structural designs, poses significant challenges for traditional research methods. Experimental testing is often costly and timeconsuming, while numerical simulations demand massive computational resources and struggle to accurately capture nonlinear damage behaviors, making them both resource-heavy and data-intensive. Machine learning offers an efficient, datadriven alternative for addressing nonlinear damage mechanisms and performance prediction in composites. This review summarizes recent advances in the application of machine learning techniques to the structural health monitoring of composites, focusing on damage localization, damage identification, and mechanical property prediction. It compares commonly used supervised algorithms like neural networks and support vector machines as well as unsupervised techniques such as clustering, discussing their advantages, such as high prediction accuracy of supervised models, and limitations, such as the reliance of many algorithms on large labeled datasets, in various applications. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, including multi-source data fusion from sensors and simulations, hybrid deep learning frameworks for enhanced feature extraction, and digital twin-based lifecycle management, aiming to advance intelligent monitoring systems for composite structures in aerospace."

This is especially important for industrial remote control applications handling time-sensitive traffic. To this end, we adapt the window reservation mechanism for wired networks introduced in IEEE 802.1Qbv to also ensure determinism over 5G wireless links. Based on the statistical characterization of the radio channel, we develop a rigorous method to determine the number of time-frequency resources that must be reserved in each 5 G subframe to accommodate all time-sensitive traffic traversing the wireless link. Numerical simulations are conducted in representative industrial scenarios, showing that neighboring base stations have to coordinate their transmissions to avoid interference and mitigate channel fading. Numerical results demonstrate that window design for timesensitive traffic benefits from coordination in two key ways: by extending coverage and significantly increasing the number of time-critical flows that a 5G network can support in industrial deployments."

    "abstract": "Sliding cables, characterized by their lightweight, high flexibility, high tensile strength, low damping, and capability to transmit loads through complex geometric paths over long distances, are extensively employed in diverse industrial applications. However, multibody dynamics analysis of sliding cable systems faces a challenge in balancing model accuracy and computational efficiency, caused by moving frictional contacts. Conventional simplified modeling approaches based on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) description, simplify frictional contact interactions to positional constraints. Then, cable motion is described as time-varying material coordinate and approximating friction via tension abatement, the stick slip effect is ignored. Addressing this limitation, this study proposes an enhanced dynamic mesh model within the ALE framework, integrating the LuGre friction model to explicitly capture presliding, stick-slip transitions, and Stribeck effects. By deriving a material-coordinate-based formulation of the LuGre friction force and its analytical Jacobian matrix, the method enables seamless incorporation into multibody dynamics equations while preserving the ALE framework's advantages in handling large displacements without remeshing. Numerical simulations of a cable-pulley transmission system validate the model's capability to accurately reproduce stick-slip behavior, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional tension-decay approximations. The proposed approach resolves abrupt friction transitions and enhances prediction accuracy for systems exhibiting intermittent stick-slip motion, yet maintains computational tractability through efficient Jacobian implementation. These advancements bridge a critical gap in sliding cable dynamics simulations, offering a robust tool for applications where friction-induced nonlinearities dominate, such as crane operations, robotic manipulators, and aerospace deployable mechanisms."

In this study, two ecological datasets from the Central-eastern Mediterranean Sea were analyzed: one related to cetacean feeding modeling in the Northern Ionian Sea, and the other devoted at predicting habitat suitability for Caretta caretta in the Adriatic-Ionian region. Both datasets were open-access enriched with environmental predictors. Spatial and temporal autocorrelation were assessed using Moran’s I, autocorrelation functions (ACF), and the Ljung-Box test, revealing consistent temporal dependencies across variables and spatial structure depending on dataset and predictor type. To preliminarily evaluate the impact of temporal autocorrelation on model performance, a Random Forest and a SVM classifiers were trained on the cetacean dataset to predict Tursiops truncatus feeding behavior. Model performances were compared using state-of-the-art k-fold and temporal cross-validation strategies. The latter yielded more realistic estimates by preserving the temporal structure and avoiding information leakage. This work provides a first step toward evaluating temporal cross-validation as a suitable approach for mitigating the effects of autocorrelation in marine ecological modeling."

    "abstract": "Contamination of marine sediments is becoming increasingly important in defining environmental acceptability thresholds when planning remediation and restoration measures, as well as in assessing the quality of marine ecosystems and the contamination impact on their functionality. Bottom sediments naturally accumulate high concentrations of persistent organic pollutants that exceed the limits set by the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs). This poses an ecotoxicological risk to marine organisms and, indirectly, to the human health. A comprehensive assessment of sediment quality is therefore important, especially when considering the spatial and vertical distribution of the most toxic contaminants in the different particle size fractions. Finer sediments are often considered important vectors of pollution due to their greater surface area and ability to absorb and retain pollutants. They are more prone than coarser grains to accumulate toxic substances and often become secondary pollution sources during resuspension phenomena, which can potentially harm organisms that come into contact with the contaminated sediments. This study aimed to determine the distribution of 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in different particle size fractions of sediments sampled from a heavily contaminated area in the Gulf of Taranto, an area under high anthropic pressure. The data discussed in this paper are of great interest for predicting resuspension phenomena of contaminated sediments and for developing possible ex situ decontamination processes for dredged sediments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we derive the second-order coding rates for message identification via simple-dispersion discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with noiseless feedback, both for deterministic and randomized encoding. Identification via channels, originally introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck, differs fundamentally from traditional message transmission: instead of decoding a specific message from multiple possibilities, the receiver seeks only to determine if a particular message was sent. Previous research established that feedback significantly enhances identification capacity, a stark contrast to the message transmission scenario. While second-order expansions are extensively studied for transmission, analogous results for identification remain largely unexplored. Our results generalize classical identification proofs by carefully modifying the standard two-phase codebook construction, previously reliant on typical sequences, thus making it suitable for second-order analysis. Additionally, we generalize the established converse argument and use martingale-based methods to obtain a tight second-order converse."

The completion time of these flight test missions represents a critically important planning element within aircraft development projects. However, accurately predicting the durations of flight test missions presents significant challenges. This study analyzes the risk factors that influence the duration of flight test missions. It employs the fuzzy assessment method to characterize both the probability of occurrence and the impact of risk events associated with flight test missions.

We capture and filter RTC traffic, design a Deep Packet Inspection framework to identify all messages for RTC media transmission, and systematically evaluate each message's compliance against protocol specifications. Our analysis of six popular RTC applications—Zoom, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger (i.e., Messenger), Discord and Google Meet—reveals that: 1) None of the studied applications strictly follow all RTC protocol specifications, and existing protocol implementations, except for QUIC, have some level of non-compliance; 2) Existing applications either implement proprietary protocols or modify existing message types to achieve the desired protocol functionality."

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) mounted on maneuverable aerial platforms to form aerial IRS (AIRS) relays represent a novel paradigm for large-scale downlink transmission in smart cities. However, the challenge of multivariate dynamic coupling hinders most existing studies due to high computational complexity and limited scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a soft-attention-actor-critic (SAAC) optimization framework that efficiently decomposes the joint optimization of multi-AIRS deployment, passive beamforming, and active beamforming at the base station into two sequential subproblems. The objective is to maximize average downlink spectral efficiency and service fairness, while minimizing deployment energy consumption. In the first stage, a conservative lower bound of spectral efficiency is formulated to guide multiple AIRSs toward near-optimal deployment positions. In the second stage, refined optimization is performed for both passive and active beamforming matrices. Furthermore, multi-head attention modules are incorporated into the critic and actor networks in each phase, enabling AIRS to adaptively attend to the observations and actions of other agents, and enhancing the ability to handle high-dimensional observation-action spaces. Extensive simulation results validate that the proposed SAAC framework consistently outperforms mainstream deep reinforcement learning baselines across diverse network conditions, highlighting its superior performance and scalability."

The opportunity is to enable large MIMO systems and thus improve wireless performance. The approach aims to leverage QA to expedite the computation required for theoretically optimal but computationally-demanding Maximum Likelihood detection to overcome the limitations of the currently deployed linear detectors. This paper presents X-ResQ, a QA-based MIMO detector system featuring flexible parallelism that is uniquely enabled by quantum Reverse Annealing (RA). Unlike prior designs, X-ResQ has many desirable parallel QA system properties and has effectively improved detection performance as more qubits are assigned. In our evaluations on a state-of-the-art quantum annealer, fully parallel X-ResQ achieves near-optimal throughput for 4 × 6 MIMO with 16-QAM using approx. 240 qubits achieving 2.5–5× gains compared against other classical and quantum detectors. We also implement and evaluate X-ResQ in the non-quantum digital setting for more comprehensive evaluations. This classical X-ResQ showcases the potential to realize ultra-large 1024 × 1024 MIMO, significantly outperforming other MIMO detectors, including the state-of-the-art RA detector classically implemented in the same way."

In this paper, we present a novel system named BoRa, which enables bi-directional communication between the COTS BLE and COTS LoRa chips. The key idea of BoRa to emulate the linear frequency changes of the LoRa chirp is continuously tuning its Modulation Offset (MO), which is originally designed to compensate for the Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) in BLE chips. BoRa can be readily run on COTS chips without any hardware modifications."

A previously optimized TREIT algorithm is utilized, and novel validation and fusion approaches leveraging pathology information are considered. Overall, the aim was to increase the sensed volume of a standard 12-core prostate biopsy by adding TREIT imaging. Two TREIT approaches were considered: 1. including prostate boundary information (EIT-P) and 2. including prostate and tumor boundary information (EIT-P+T). Both simple electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) metrics and the two imaging approaches (EIT-P and EIT-P+T) were evaluated with respect to biopsy core, 3D (EIT-P) image, and tumor-grade data. Best AUCs of 0.85, 0.84, and 0.83 were found when considering increasing volumes of tissue (0.8%, 2.7%, and 15% of the prostate). The largest measurement volume (15%), which utilized EIT-P, sensed significantly more prostate tissue than the standard biopsy only approach (<1%). These represent large improvement compared to prior clinical EIS biopsy and TREIT studies. Tumor-grade analysis (via EIT-P+T) appears to show promise but more data is required to confirm this. Overall, the study made important strides in developing the TREIT technique and further investigation, likely in an in vivo study, appears merited."

    "abstract": "Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities. Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a significant speed-up (1000ttttttttttttttttttttttttttt) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in massive time series data in two usage scenarios."

For instance, next generation reconfigurable antennas have the potential to control channel statistics. Further, the known trajectory and operation protocol of communication satellites results in networks with predictable statistics. These settings give rise to a non-stationary model for which the fundamentals are largely unknown. We consider the canonical two-user broadcast packet erasure channel in which channel statistics vary at a priori known points in time. We consider a multi-modal setting with two non-transient modes (whose lengths scale linearly with the blocklength) and an arbitrary number of transient modes. We provide a new set of outer-bounds on the capacity region of this problem when the encoder has access to causal feedback. The results reveal the significant role of the non-transient mode with higher erasure probability both on the outer and the inner bounds. We show the outer-bounds are achievable in non-trivial regimes, characterizing the capacity region for a wide range of parameters. We also discuss the regimes where the inner and outer bounds diverge and analyze the gap between the two. A key finding of this work is the significant gain of inter-modal coding over the separate treating of individual modes."

To tackle these issues, by incorporating the symmetric Gauss–Seidel (sGS) decomposition, this work develops a GPU-based Halpern Peaceman-Rachford algorithm, termed the sGS-HPR, which enjoys an <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(1/k)$</tex-math></inline-formula> iteration complexity in terms of the KKT residual.

Notably, the proposed method achieves a 6× speedup compared with Gurobi for large-scale instances. Additionally, for ultra-large-scale cases, Gurobi throws an “out-of-memory” error, while the proposed sGS-HPR algorithm maintains its computational scalability and efficiency."

    "abstract": "High-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning is critical for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. However, it faces significant challenges in urban canyons and signal-obstructed environments, where multipath effects and poor satellite geometry lead to accuracy degradation. In such cases, additional auxiliary information is required. Existing map-aided localization methods either focus on meter-level positioning through road network matching or turning to high-definition (HD) maps with higher maintenance costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight system that constructs road surface maps using only vehicle trajectories and integrates the map information with GNSS real-time kinematic (RTK) to enhance positioning accuracy. Our method leverages geometric constraints by iteratively optimizing the distance from the GNSS antenna to the road surface, applying elevation priors to mitigate vertical uncertainty and improve horizontal accuracy simultaneously, which also enables online calibration of antenna height differences. Experiments were conducted in both controlled test field environments and complex urban road scenario. The results demonstrate notable improvements in positioning accuracy in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. In complex and challenging scenarios, the use of prior road surface constraints led to average improvements of 59.43% in horizontal precision and 89.70% in vertical precision. The proposed road surface map, with its compact data and crowdsourcing compatibility, offers a cost-effective solution for high-precision urban navigation without reliance on expensive HD maps or high-end sensors."

    "abstract": "Indoor optical wireless communication (OWC) offers high-speed and secure transmission, but is vulnerable to blockage under line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) OWC mitigates this by leveraging diffused optical paths, yet introduces a challenging channel environment with severe multipath dispersion, signal attenuation, device nonlinearity, and inter-symbol interference (ISI)—especially at high data rates. These factors significantly degrade performance and limit the effectiveness of traditional equalizers. This letter proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based equalizer designed to address the challenges of NLOS indoor OWC. Compared to conventional equalizers, the PINN equalizer improves the bit error rate (BER) by 24.6% to 70.87% under varying data rates and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) bias currents. Compared to an equalizer based on a vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN), our proposed PINN equalizer reduces the training time by 8.21% to 52.22%. Experimental results confirm the potential of PINN for efficient and robust NLOS indoor OWC."

    "abstract": "The explosive growth and increasing complexity of modern 5G/6G networks, driven by Internet-of-Things (IoT), industrial automation, and real‑time multimedia streaming, demand forecasting methods that address non‑stationarity, abrupt shifts, and incomplete observations. Non‑stationarity involves changing statistical properties, abrupt shifts stem from events or outages, and data gaps can impair model accuracy. Traditional statistical models and deep sequence learners partially handle these challenges but often leave systematic residuals, which are structured errors from unmodeled scenarios and overlook high‑level contextual cues such as external events or semantic patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework combining a convolutional neural network–long short-term memory (CNN–LSTM) trend predictor for capturing local fluctuations and long‑range dependencies, an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) residual corrector to refine forecast errors, and a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)‑fine‑tuned large language model (LLM) that generates semantic labels of trend direction, anomaly type, and volatility regime to enrich residual learning. Experimental evaluation on real‑world cellular traffic data shows up to 15% reduction in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and 10% reduction in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to state‑of‑the‑art hybrid baselines, with substantially improved resilience to noise, missing data, and abrupt traffic surges. Our contributions include a parameter‑efficient prompt‑based LoRA fine‑tuning pipeline for adapting LLMs to time‑series forecasting, a context‑aware residual learning architecture fusing numerical and linguistic features, and comprehensive empirical validation demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in dynamic network environments."

The nozzle contour was designed using the backward characteristic line method with axial Mach number distribution, replacing traditional wake-assumption approaches to suppress expansion wave interference. A Purdue-type suction slot was integrated to delay boundary layer transition, with slot parameters optimized through CFD simulations at Mach 6 conditions. Computational analysis demonstrated that suction throat height critically influences efficiency: increasing from 1.83 mm to 3.72 mm improved suction efficiency from 15.14-16.78% to 28.05-29.81%. Optimal positioning placed the suction port 20 mm downstream of the nozzle throat, achieving Mach 0.3 inflow without separation. The distance between suction port and suction throat showed minimal efficiency impact (29.70-29.86%) but affected inflow velocity. Slot geometry refinement using a quadratic profile with increased curvature radius eliminated outlet separation zones observed in initial designs. The final configuration achieved 29.8% suction efficiency with high nozzle outlet flow uniformity (mean core Mach number: 6.001, RMS deviation: 0.0042). Transition behavior was evaluated using SST and R-y models. The SST model predicted transition onset upstream of the suction slot at x=-0.08 m, while the R-y model indicated earlier transition near the inlet. Both models confirmed the suction slot effectively delays boundary layer transition, showing ≤5% discrepancy in transition onset prediction x/L ±0.02)."

In recent years, there has been growing interest in designing IoT system architectures and leveraging AI-driven Electrocardiography (ECG) analysis to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, thereby making high-quality cardiac care more accessible. However, these advancements require secure and efficient diagnostic solutions. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based ECG monitoring system. Blockchain offers a decentralized and transparent approach that enables data provenance, auditability, reliability, and trustworthiness. By integrating Hyperledger Fabric, our approach ensures secure data management, identity verification, and privacy protection. IoT devices connected to ECG sensors placed on the patient’s body are capable of locally monitoring, analyzing ECG signals in real time, and classifying them as normal or abnormal without the need to transfer raw data to an external server. First, we train a hybrid CNN-GRU model using the MIT-BIH dataset. Then, we optimize the model through quantization and deploy it in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for embedded execution. Deployment results show that our model achieves $\\mathbf{9 7. 2 \\%}$ accuracy with an inference time of approximately 142 ms, while maintaining a compact size, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time, privacy-preserving healthcare applications."

    "abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may be viewed as a set of sensor devices where each sensor can monitor a specific area and relay detected events to a central data sink for analysis and processing. However, due to factors such as sensor failures or imperfect initial deployment, uncovered areas, known as “coverage holes”, may emerge, leading to gaps in monitoring. To address this issue, mobile sensor nodes can be deployed to dynamically cover these blind regions and restore network coverage. Efficient path planning for these mobile nodes is crucial to ensure maximum coverage while minimizing travel time and energy consumption. In this study, we propose a two-phase optimization-based approach for guiding mobile sensor nodes to efficiently cover uncovered zones in a sensing area. The first phase employs a Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) model to determine the optimal number of critical sensing area positions that the mobile sensor must visit to achieve dynamic total area coverage. The second phase identifies the optimal position locations and optimizes the movement trajectory to minimize travel distance. The performance of the two-phase method is evaluated through simulations using various network sizes and node sensing ranges. Comparisons with existing approaches in the literature clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior results in a reasonable time frame."

However, operating in confined spaces induces the proximity effect, which substantially degrades the platform's aerodynamic behavior and control effectiveness, posing significant challenges to stable system operation. This research utilizes a deep neural network (DNN) to develop a dynamic model for the flying platform experiencing aerodynamic interactions with different surroundings. The resulting model demonstrated high accuracy, achieving mean-square errors (MSE) below <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1 \\mathrm{e}^{-2}$</tex> on both training and test datasets. Building upon this model, a backstepping adaptive controller incorporating the aerodynamic interaction model is introduced. Simulation analyses across various constrained environments were conducted to validate the controller's effectiveness. The simulation results show that compared with the baseline control strategy, the proposed deep learning model combined with the adaptive strategy has smaller tracking errors when the platform maneuvering under constrained environment, proving that its control performance is better. This research is useful for enhancing the flight stability and operational capability of unmanned aerial platforms in different constrained environments."

To characterize the benefits of MA-enabled ISAC systems, we focus on the line-of-sight (LoS) channel scenario and derive the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for angle estimation error, which is then minimized by jointly optimizing the antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming design, subject to a pre-defined signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraint to ensure the communication performance. Despite the non-convexity of the resulting problem, we develop a boundary traversal breadth-first search (BT-BFS) algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution, along with a lower-complexity boundary traversal depth-first search (BT-DFS) algorithm to find a local optimal solution efficiently. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate the superiority of the considered MA-enabled ISAC system over conventional ISAC systems with fixed-position antennas (FPAs)."

    "abstract": "Mega-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are characterized by highly dynamic topologies and stringent performance requirements, posing significant challenges to traditional routing strategies. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Q-learning, offers a promising framework for adaptive routing in such environments; however, its slow convergence limits practical deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes an Enhanced Q-Learning Routing (EQLR) strategy that accelerates convergence through two key mechanisms: (1) pre-initialization of the Q-table leveraging the predictable orbital dynamics of satellites, thereby providing informed initial estimates; and (2) dynamic adjustment of the exploration coefficient based on Q-value variations, enabling a more efficient transition from exploration to exploitation. Simulation results demonstrate that EQLR achieves a $50 \\%$ reduction in convergence time compared to conventional Q-learning, facilitating faster stabilization of routing paths under rapidly evolving network conditions. Although the average hop count and end-to-end latency remain comparable to baseline methods, EQLR offers significantly improved responsiveness, making it well-suited for large-scale, latency-sensitive satellite networks."

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) form the backbone of critical infrastructure, enabling automated monitoring, and control across essential industrial sectors. However, the convergence of legacy ICS with modern networking and computing technologies has significantly broadened their cyberattack surface. Despite this growing vulnerability, many existing anomaly detection techniques depend on centralized architectures that introduce high communication overhead, delayed threat response, and elevated false positive rates, particularly when addressing rare or stealthy attacks. Furthermore, most conventional approaches are optimized for detecting system-level anomalies, often neglecting subtle intrusions that compromise individual ICS components and pose serious security risks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a collaborative, hierarchical observability and privacy-preserving framework based on distributed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Each sensor’s latent state is captured locally using dedicated LSTM model, and these embeddings are then fused through a dual optimization strategy that supports both sensor-level and system-wide anomaly detection. In contrast to traditional federated learning, our framework enables secure and privacy-preserving exchange of sensor state information across multiple ICS nodes, enhancing the system’s ability to detect coordinated and stealthy attacks. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the HAI-21.03 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully identifies both fine-grained sensor anomalies and complex stealthy system-level intrusions, while minimizing communication overhead."

    "abstract": "PKCS#11 is a widely adopted Application Programming Interface (API) standard designed to facilitate interactions between applications and cryptographic devices such as smart cards, USB tokens, and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). It defines entity authentication mechanisms—covering both Security Officers (SO) and regular users—based primarily on static Personal Identification Numbers (PINs). However, static PIN-based authentication exhibits significant security limitations in high-assurance environments.This paper introduces an enhanced authentication mechanism for the SO role in the PKCS#11 framework, addressing the vulnerabilities of default static credentials. The proposed solution employs Shamir’s threshold secret sharing scheme, wherein the authentication secret is divided into n shares, requiring collaboration from at least k administrators to reconstruct the secret (k ≤ n). This approach eliminates single points of failure and mitigates the risk of privilege misuse.The mechanism is integrated with modern cryptographic primitives, including PBKDF2 and AES-256-CBC, to strengthen resilience against brute-force and impersonation attacks. Experimental evaluation within a PKCS#11-compliant environment demonstrates that total authentication latency remains below 200 ms, with storage overhead under 1 KB—fully compatible with commercial HSM deployment requirements. These findings confirm the practicality of the solution for real-world application in critical infrastructure, aligning with the PKCS#11 (OASIS, 2024) recommendations for advanced access control enhancement."

This paper proposes a three-dimensional UAV path planning method based on Multi-Objective Lemurs Optimizer (MOLO) and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, in response to the safety and path planning requirements of UAVs in the low-altitude economy. Firstly, the objective functions, including path length, collision detection, flight height, and smoothness, are constructed, and the lemur optimizer is extended by introducing the Pareto optimal solution theory to form a multi-objective optimization framework. Secondly, ORCA algorithm is combined to enhance the dynamic adaptability of path planning, enabling real-time avoidance of dynamic obstacles through speed adjustment strategies. Simulation experiments show that the MOLO algorithm achieves leading multi-objective path planning performance on multiple maps compared with algorithms like MOPSO and MOGWO, and demonstrates excellent obstacle avoidance capabilities in dynamic scenarios when combined with ORCA. This provides an efficient path planning solution for the UAVs safe flight in the development of the low-altitude economy."

By engaging residents, industries, and municipalities, smart cities use data-driven strategies to navigate complex challenges. To overcome issues like energy optimization, climate change, and population growth, cities must implement scalable and intelligent ICT architectures that efficiently manage data. Expanding on the first author’s novel contributions in previous studies, this paper introduces a holistic Five-Category Centric framework to address the complexities of decentralized, distributed, and hybrid ICT architectures. This framework integrates five dimensions: “business,” “user,” “technology,” “sustainability,” and “partner & ecosystem.” The key contribution is the selection and mapping of two previously proposed ICT architectures-Fog-to-Cloud Data Management (F2C-DM), applied to District-to-Zone-toCity Data Management, and Distributed-to-Centralized Software Management (D2C-SM), applied to Building-to-Neighborhoods-to-Cities Data Management-onto the new Five-Category Centric framework. This alignment is demonstrated, showcasing how the framework seamlessly integrates edge-level fog processing with centralized cloud management, optionally utilizing both private and public multi-cloudlet and cloud solutions, while also enabling both independent and orchestrated hierarchical multi-tier management across edge-to-cloud solutions. This approach ensures Smart, Sustainable, Scalable, and Reliable IoT service management for smart cities. The framework supports both end-to-end urban and citizen demands, as well as ICT/IoT applications for operations, resource management, and service delivery. It covers services from building and neighborhood up to district, zone, and city scales, mapping edge, fog, cloudlet, and cloud infrastructures to improve orchestration efficiency and interoperability."

The aging environment has a significant impact on its performance. In this study, hygrothermal aging tests were conducted on T800 carbon fiber composites. The micromechanical parameters of the composites were characterized and compared with their macro-mechanical properties. The results indicate that during hygrothermal aging, the resin matrix gradually detaches from the fiber surface, accompanied by fiber filament pull-out and fracture, ultimately leading to material failure and a decline in mechanical performance. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses reveal significant molecular-level structural damage in the T800 carbon fiber composites. Experimental data demonstrate that chemical reactions occur among elemental groups in the material as aging progresses: The proportion of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$C=C$</tex> group decreased, while the proportion of the C-C group increased significantly.

Targeting the complex wind environments formed by urban canopy effects-including local circulations, building-induced turbulence, and other wind field phenomena-the research focuses on the influence mechanisms of building clusters on macro-scale wind field structures, micro-scale turbulence distributions and special wind field morphologies in low-altitude flight zones under varying wind speeds and dominant wind directions. By implementing the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$k-\\varepsilon$</tex> turbulence model, the study reveals the following key findings: 1.Acceleration effects: windward buildings generate acceleration zones with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$30 \\%-40 \\%$</tex> speed amplification on both sides. 2.Wake characteristics: downwind areas exhibit extended low-speed wake regions spanning 4-6 times the building height, where wind speeds decay to below 40 % of the background flow. 3.Special wind field phenomena: about canyon winds, when building spacing is not more than 12 m, the maximum speed increase in canyon winds reaches 30 %; about roof vortices, velocity gradients exceeding <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> form in vortex separation zones due to roof flow detachments; about multi-scale vortex coupling, internal courtyards exhibit coupled multi-scale vortices, directly impacting aircraft stability. This study quantitatively reveals the evolution law of the vertical wind field structure (ground flow layer, building interference layer, roof turbulence layer) in low airspace of urban residential areas, and suggests establishing a typical wind field standard model for low altitude environments to assist risk prediction."

    "abstract": "We consider reward systems defined as iterative decision-making processes, where a player selects an action from the unit interval, and the environment responds by choosing a reward function from a known set of functions. The goal of the player is to accumulate rewards that exceed a given threshold in minimal time, and the performance is measured via regret with respect to an optimal player who knows the entire sequence of reward functions in advance. The central challenge lies in the dynamical nature of the reward system: each time step may involve a different reward function, requiring the player’s policy to adapt over time and making the regret an infinite-letter optimization problem. Our main result is an explicit expression for the optimal regret in the case of two linear reward functions that have opposing slopes. Moreover, we show that the optimal regret is achieved by a piecewise-constant action sequence, where both the transition times and action values exhibit special structural properties. These properties seem fundamental and may extend to classes of nonlinear reward functions. Finally, we highlight the implications of our solution in the context of communication, particularly, in characterizing the capacity of arbitrarily varying channels (AVCs) under competitive performance criteria."

    "abstract": "To overcome the excessive weight/volume, poor shock resistance and low load-to-weight ratio problems in traditional space manipulators, this study designs a prototype of adaptive bionic cable-driven manipulator (CDM). This CDM is designed with gradient-configured pulley diameters (proximal increasing/distal decreasing) and Kevlar fiber figure-8 winding. The integrated structure of CDM achieves compactness and flexibility while reducing weight-to-volume, significantly. The modular knuckle design results in finger/knuckle quantity expansion and gripping surface envelope adjustment based on operational requirements. Driving torque analysis demonstrates that a single motor can synchronously drive multiple knuckles through pulley assemblies. By adding a fiber tension modulation and pulley diameter gradient, the optimal torque allocation is achieved, enabling sequential knuckle bending for adaptive grasping of variously shaped objects. In addition, a structural lightweight design is performed through static simulations with full considerations on Kevlar fiber tensile strength and carbon fiber knuckle stiffness. By implementing kinematic modeling on this manipulator, both forward and inverse equations are derived and operational space mappings are obtained. This bionic manipulator is further integrated with an intelligent space flying robot for autonomous space grasping tasks, and ground experiments show both effectiveness and adaptability of our designed bionic manipulator."

We introduce a generalized variant of the standard unlearning metric that enables more efficient and precise unlearning strategies. We also present an unlearning-aware training procedure that, in many cases, allows for exact unlearning. We term our approach MaxRR. When exact unlearning is not feasible, MaxRR still supports efficient unlearning with properties closely matching those achieved through full retraining."

The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system complies with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s recent flight safety regulations and is now widely adopted by most airlines. Nevertheless, ADS-B features some serious vulnerabilities due its open nature which may results in several attacks such as spoofing endangering flight operations. In addition, ADS-B governance requirements vary significantly per regions while AI-based methods lack formal oversight and alignment with AI governance. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a mapping of ADS-B vulnerabilities, attacks and AI-based solutions with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF), and the NIST AI RMF. We also highlight the ADS-B mandates in case studies focusing on USA, Europe, Canada, China and Australia. Our findings highlights the gap in applying cybersecurity and AI risk management frameworks in aviation. This paper would serve as a reference for key stakeholders in aviation aiming to conduct further research in this field and establish a foundational layered governance framework that addresses all the highlighted gaps in this work."

    "abstract": "Offering high-quality immersive content is the ultimate goal of volumetric video streaming. Although point clouds and meshes are dominant volumetric representations, their limitations in depicting photo-realistic content often undermine user experience. The recent advent of neural radiance fields (NeRF) offers a promising alternative content representation with superior photo-realism. However, streaming NeRF-based volumetric videos over wireless networks to mobile headsets faces significant challenges, including substantial bandwidth usage because of the large frame size, degraded visual quality due to even a low packet loss rate, and content artifacts caused by performance optimizations (e.g., remote rendering at the network edge). To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce NeVo, a next-generation volumetric video streaming system for efficient delivery of neural content such as NeRF. NeVo incorporates the following innovations into a holistic system: (1) a novel method to model visibility of implicitly encoded neural content, thereby avoiding non-essential transmission to drastically reduce network data usage, (2) a lightweight, learning-based model for real-time content reconstruction after packet loss with carefully chosen data, and (3) judicious identification and selective delivery of intermediate data in edge-based NeRF rendering to effectively mitigate artifacts. Our extensive experiments indicate that compared with the state-of-the-art, NeVo saves up to 68.3% of bandwidth usage, maintains high visual quality despite packet loss, and enhances user experience by reducing artifacts."

Recent advancements have enabled more convenient measurements by shifting spirometry solutions from cumbersome clinical devices to portable devices. However, the forced maneuvers and burdensome procedures, which necessitate repeated maximal forced breathing, often lead to dizziness and discomfort, rendering them unsuitable for vulnerable populations. In this paper, we present ESPIRO (Earphone-enabled Speech sPIROmetry) system to furnish user-friendly pulmonary function monitoring for diverse populations. Basically, ESPIRO records normal speech using microphone-embedded earphones and characterizes pulmonary function-related glottal flow during speech production. ESPIRO advances existing spirometry solutions in i) leveraging phonetics to associate pulmonary function with glottal flow in normal speech, thereby eliminating the need for forced breathing; ii) identifying effective speech features according to physiological basis, ensuring reliable spirometry measurements; and iii) effectively addressing ambient noise, making it suitable for various real-world settings. Extensive experiments with 38 subjects on 18 commodity earphones confirm that ESPIRO accurately estimates pulmonary function indices in practice."

The working principle is theoretically analyzed and optimal filtering parameters are analyzed with the practical experimental configuration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a temperature accuracy of 0.49°C, indicating a 28 dB enhancement compared with the raw data while maintaining 4.6 mm spatial resolution. Compared to other conventional filtering methods applied in Φ-OFDR, the proposed hybrid Hampel-Median filter yields about 2∼4 times improvement in sensing accuracy and increases SNR by more than 5 dB with consistent spatial resolution condition. On the other hand, the proposed filtering method enhances the spatial resolution about 2∼6 times with the same sensing accuracy. The experimental results reveal that the novel filtering approach enables high sensing accuracy and spatial resolution for the distributed temperature or strain sensing scenarios of Φ-OFDR, without any hardware modifications."

    "abstract": "With the continuous expansion of industrial internet of things (IIoT) applications, secure cross-domain authentication has emerged as a critical technical challenge. Traditional authentication schemes based on trusted third parties suffer from single point of failure risks, while blockchain-based decentralized approaches incur excessive computational overhead. Both methods share a common deficiency: authentication nodes must repeatedly execute authentication procedures at each target domain’s gateway when performing cross-domain authentication. This repetitive mechanism significantly increases resource consumption and limits the system’s ability to satisfy strict real-time requirements. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight and reusable cross-domain authentication scheme (LRCDA) based on distributed architecture. First, the proposed scheme, based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem, enables edge nodes to autonomously establish system keys and independently verify identities, completely eliminating dependence on centralized third parties and mitigating single point of failure risks. Furthermore, the scheme introduces a cross-domain reusable signature mechanism, allowing signature to be securely reused across multiple security domains during its validity period, thereby reducing the frequency of signature generation and minimizing authentication latency. Moreover, through efficient task allocation, computationally intensive operations are offloaded to edge nodes, thereby reducing the computational burden on terminal devices. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the LRCDA scheme meets the security and privacy requirements for cross-domain authentication in industrial IoT environments, encompassing anonymity, signature unforgeability, and resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks. Experimental evaluations reveal that LRCDA scheme reduces authentication latency by 77.4% compared to traditional schemes and by 88.2% compared to existing distributed approaches, demonstrating significant efficiency gains for resource-constrained industrial IoT deployments."

Accurate and timely species-level identification is essential for effective treatment but is often hindered by the labor-intensive and expertise-dependent nature of manual microscopic examination. This study presents FungAI, a two-stage deep learning pipeline for the automated classification of 20 clinically relevant fungal species from microscopic images. The first stage leverages deep learning models, including CNNs, Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Mamba-based architectures, to establish a robust classification backbone. While these models achieved high accuracy for filamentous fungi, they exhibited limitations in differentiating morphologically similar yeast species. To address this, a second-stage classifier was introduced and trained on handcrafted morphological features, enabling fine-grained discrimination among yeast classes. This addition led to significant performance gains, particularly when tested on the external test set, with accuracy improvements of up to approximately 10 percentage points. The best-performing model - a FungAI Two-Stage NextViT–MambaVision ensemble - achieved 92% accuracy across both holdout and external test sets. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for clinical deployment, reducing diagnostic turnaround time from up to 28 days to just 2 days. These results underscore the value of combining diverse architectural approaches with domain-specific morphological insights, setting a new benchmark for AI-driven medical mycology."

The system is designed to efficiently deliver solar energy to both the load and the grid while significantly improving power quality (PQ). It employs a Hybrid pelican and perturb and observe (HPPO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to consistently extract peak power from the PV array. AHLMS, with its adaptive hysteresis load management system, generates reference signals for both active and reactive grid currents for controlling the switching operation of a voltage source converter. In addition, this intelligent procedure tunes the control parameters in real-time to reduce tracking errors and adapts dynamically to environmental variations, including solar irradiance, load imbalances, and nonlinearities. The proposed PV-STATCOM is considered PQ-enhanced because it provides reactive power compensation, suppresses harmonic distortion (HD), stabilizes system voltages, and improves the power factor (PF). The output current remains sinusoidal and fits well with minimal HD while complying with IEEE-519 standards. Mathematical simulation in MATLAB/Simulink were applied, along with comparisons to the most recent methodologies, ensures that this system outperforms others under varying sunlight, nonlinear, and unbalanced loading conditions."

In this paper, a fault detection scheme for multiple SM failures is proposed. To handle the influence of rectifier mode, this detection is based on the fault feature of SM output voltage. Furthermore, the fault feature is presented by calculating the deviation between actual and expected common voltages via circulating current loop model, which lowers the dependence on the measurement devices. Then, the component in the deviation is analyzed in detail and the filter and delay subtraction are taken. By that, model errors can be cleared, which raises both the detection precision and rapidity. Based on the above, the distinguishing method is also proposed for the different fault cases to handle the diverse and complex failure combinations in high-voltage MMCs. Moreover, the comparisons indicate that the proposed detection can yield stronger detection performance, simpler implementation requirements, ampler fault messages and lower computation burden. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection scheme is verified by simulation results in Matlab/Simulink."

    "abstract": "Fusing a low-resolution (LR) hyperspectral image (HSI) with a high-resolution (HR) multispectral image (MSI) has emerged as a promising strategy for reconstructing high-quality HSIs that combine rich spectral and fine spatial information. However, most existing HSI fusion methods operate under the restrictive assumption that the LR HSI and HR MSI are spatially aligned and fully consistent on the field-of-view (FoV), which significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios when such alignment is unavailable. To overcome these limitations, we propose IrregFusion, a generalized HSI fusion framework capable of handling both FoV-consistent and inconsistent fusion scenarios. Specifically, IrregFusion incorporates a Transformer-based reconstruction module that captures both intra- and inter-modal correlations between the diverse spectra data and the MSI, enhancing the model’s ability to perceive and reconstruct non-local spectral–spatial structures. To further address the challenges posed by FoV inconsistencies, we introduce a spectral propagation strategy that diffuses observed spectral information into adjacent spectral-blank regions, thereby easing the reconstruction of missing spectral content. Additionally, a self-supervised adaptation mechanism is integrated into the framework, enabling robust spectral–spatial representation learning and enhancing generalization across diverse and challenging conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IrregFusion effectively addresses the challenges of diverse spectral data fusion and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction accuracy and visual fidelity.

In recent years, the deep learning method has been extensively applied in this field due to its ability to automatically extract the features related to the vehicle's motion from sensor data. However, how to effectively fuse IMU data and LiDAR data using supervised learning remains a challenge. In this paper, a LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) estimation method based on multimodal attention fusion network (MAFNet) is proposed for vehicle positioning. In the MAFNet, two feature extraction modules, i.e., spatio-temporal feature extraction module (STFE) and multi-motion feature extraction module (MMFE) are constructed. The motion features of the vehicle are indirectly extracted by STFE through the collection of change information in point clouds at different moments. The complex correlations and time dependencies of rotations and translations in different directions are innovatively learned by the MMFE, improving the model's understanding of the complex pose changes of the vehicle. Feature association guided learning mechanism (FAGLM) is then designed to guide the fusion of heterogeneous modal features by learning the correlation among multimodal features and reducing the redundant information in the features. Finally, the proposed MAFNet is applied to the Kitti odometry dataset and ablation experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that MAFNet outperforms the existing methods and achieves excellent estimation performance."

    "abstract": "A visible light communication (VLC)-based sensing system is proposed for gait recognition and classification. Human-induced reflections are modeled using a time-varying channel representation, enabling the capture of gait dynamics without requiring wearable devices. A low-cost sensing module with embedded processing and multi-channel photodetectors is implemented. Filtered signals are transformed into spectral-spatial features and analyzed using deep learning models. Experiments involving ten participants across eight gait types demonstrate that contrastive and multi-scale models achieve over 98% accuracy, highlighting the potential of VLC-based sensing for unobtrusive, privacy-preserving, and real-time human gait recognition."

We derive a bound on the error exponent as a minimum of two types of errors that we then analyze separately. We further study the mutual information and show that the support of the optimal input distribution is a subset of the three best arms. We also compute the Shannon upper bound of the capacity as a special case of a two-way channel. In the case of identically distributed arms, the upper and lower bounds are very close."

Yet, the effectiveness of Multispectral Satellite Imagery (MSI) can be limited by cloud cover and lighting conditions, in contrast to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data that can therefore be explored as a valuable alternative. This study compares the performance of Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR images and Sentinel-2 (S2) MSI images for shoreline extraction at two Mediterranean sandy beaches. For the first time, the same semiautomatic workflow was applied to both SAR and MSI datasets. The methodology comprises image preprocessing, including an additional step for SAR speckle noise reduction, unsupervised classification using Otsu thresholding, Gaussian Mixture Models, and K-means clustering, as well as a contour extraction algorithm.The extracted shorelines were validated against high-resolution orthomosaics (25 cm), using Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and bias. Results show that S2 generally offers higher spatial accuracy, achieving sub-pixel MAD values. Regarding the bias, S1 consistently showed a negative bias with greater variability across all contexts, whereas S2 exhibited a slight positive and more constant bias. These results suggest a different ability to capture the boundaries present on the beach (land–water, dry sand–wet sand) and a different sensitivity to the morphological context of the shoreline, other than suggesting possible strengths and limitations of each sensor."

In this study, we propose a clusteringbased data reduction approach to support the training of predictive models over large spatiotemporal marine datasets. The methodology is applied to wave measurements collected from four buoy locations in the Mediterranean Sea as part of the Italian National Wave Recording Network (RON), Mazara del Vallo, Ponza, Monopoli, and Ancona, complemented by wind data from ECMWF reanalysis. A time window segmentation strategy is employed, followed by K -means clustering to extract representative samples. The optimal number of clusters is determined via the total variance criterion and elbow method, ensuring statistical representativeness and capturing key wave dynamics such as storm events and calm conditions. The results demonstrate the method capability to reduce the training dataset without compromising variability in Hs. Furthermore, we assess the spatial transferability of clustering solutions across different sites using normalized total variance, indicating that centroids extracted in one region can generalize well to other buoys. The proposed approach enables the development of computationally efficient and physically interpretable forecasting models."

Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially coupled codes."

The key components of the trailing cone system and their design features and requirements are introduced. The principles of the selection for the trailing cone hose length and diameter are summaried. The basic principles of the tower fly-by flight test calibration method for trailing cone system and several different approaches evolved from this method during actual flight tests are introduced. These flight test methods include the ground-marking method, the radio altimeter method and the differential GPS method. The ground-marking method needs to draw a reference line on the ground and the tower is equipped with a sensitive altimeter and a means of determining the relative angle of the aircraft. The radio altimeter method uses the aircraft's radio altimeter to measure the above ground height. The differential GPS method uses two differential GPS antenna to measure the height difference. The data analysis methods and comparison of the differences, advantages, and disadvantages for each flight test method are also introduced. Furthermore, it proposes methods to improve the trailing cone system flight test calibration accuracy from three aspects: pitch attitude correction, instrument error correction of static pressure transducer, and high mach number correction. This research can provide a reference for subsequent civil aircraft flight test activities."

In the past few years, a lot of researchers utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the base for their networks. Nevertheless, the traditional CNN models face challenges in effectively capturing information at multi-scales. To solve this problem, researchers increase the depth of the networks. However, as these networks become deeper, there is a simultaneous increase in both the number of parameters and computational complexity. The increasing number of parameters and growing computational complexity gradually become another tricky problem. Therefore, we propose a multi-branch module to deal with the issue of capturing multi-scale information while maintaining lower parameters and computational complexity. Moreover, we integrate channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms into the module without excessive parameters or computational burdens."

ESUs capture physical-world data, ESP manages semantic information, and VSPs create immersive virtual environments. To improve utility under heterogeneous information and computational requirements, we model semantic information trading as a three-stage Stackelberg game and prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, to overcome high-dimensional dynamics and slow convergence in semantic trading, we develop a Diffusion Game Algorithm (DGA) combining strategic exploration with a game-theoretic denoising mechanism, achieving robust convergence. Simulation results show DGA increases system utility by 8.49%–33.94%."

In this paper, we analyze the scheduling and placement of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud platform of SAP, the world's largest enterprise resource planning software vendor. Based on data from roughly 1,800 hypervisors and 48,000 VMs within a 30-day observation period, we highlight potential improvements for workload management. The data was measured through observability tooling that tracks resource usage and performance metrics across the entire infrastructure. In contrast to existing datasets, ours uniquely offers fine-grained time-series telemetry data of fully virtualized enterprise-level workloads from both long-running and memory-intensive SAP S/4HANA and diverse, general-purpose applications. Our key findings include several suboptimal scheduling situations, such as CPU resource contention exceeding 40%, CPU ready times of up to 220 seconds, significantly imbalanced compute hosts with a maximum CPU~utilization on intra-building block hosts of up to 99%, and overprovisioned CPU and memory resources resulting into over 80% of VMs using less than 70% of the provided resources. Bolstered by these findings, we derive requirements for the design and implementation of novel placement and scheduling algorithms and provide guidance to optimize resource allocations. We make the full dataset used in this study publicly available to enable data-driven evaluations of scheduling approaches for large-scale cloud infrastructures in future research."

    "abstract": "Magnetic map simultaneous surveying and reconstruction (SSAR) is a key challenge in magnetic navigation. Most interpolation-based reconstruction methods exhibit singularity problems when drones with magnetic sensors conduct linear aerial surveys, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To tackle this challenge, we draw inspiration from Shannon’s information theory and geometric topology theory, introducing a novel topological loss and compensation model. This model combines topological loss metrics, magnetic map reconstruction, noise perturbation, and compensation evaluation, offering a comprehensive framework for representing and resolving singularity problems in magnetic map SSAR, particularly in cases where location stamps of magnetic fingerprints are distributed along a quasi-strict line. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can concisely yet accurately represent the essence of the singularity problem in magnetic map SSAR as topological loss, and completely resolves the singularity problem inherent in various reconstruction methods. Specifically, it improves the successful interpolation rate from 0% to nearly 100%, and reduces the normalized magnetic fingerprint error within 0.18. This work addresses the widespread yet often overlooked mathematical singularity problem in magnetic fingerprint measurements, facilitating SSAR of magnetic maps."

    "abstract": "Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$2.5\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula> higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority.

    "abstract": "In this publication, we present the design and realization of a novel tunable bandpass filter utilizing a cascaded parametric amplifier architecture, configured in a way that increases the tunable bandwidth and produces gain. The filter is based on a two-stage design comprising of an upconverter and a downconverter in series with each other. The mixing is done using varactor diodes, known for high conversion gain and low-noise capabilities. The amplifiers are used to upconvert the signal to a fixed resonant idler, and then downconvert the signal back to its original frequency resulting in a narrow passband and out-of-band rejection. The prototype is configured using a hybrid MMIC-PCB approach and is demonstrated over the tunable frequency range of 1.1~2.1GHz, with an up to 5dB gain at the passband, a noise figure of 3.8dB, and over 30dB suppression out-of-band."

Our proposed approach leverages dynamic port switching capability of FAS, enabling UAV to adaptively select the optimal antenna location that maximizes channel gain for both downlink wireless power transfer (WPT) and uplink wireless data transfer (WDT). We derive both the exact analytical expression of the ergodic spectral rate and the asymptotic expression at the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime under Nakagami-m correlated fading channels. The Monte Carlo simulation results confirm the accuracy of the analytical expressions and demonstrate the substantial increase in energy efficiency of UAV with FAS compared to fixed antenna systems."

    "abstract": "Incipient faults frequently occur in underground cables due to the widespread aging of power distribution infrastructure. These faults are self-clearing with short duration, posing significant challenges for accurately pinpointing their locations. This paper proposes a novel incipient fault location scheme for medium-voltage underground distribution systems in North America, leveraging synchronized waveform measurement units (WMUs). Initially, zero-sequence fault voltage models at the fault point are derived from upstream and downstream WMU measurements, incorporating system topology and parameters. Utilizing these zero-sequence fault voltage models, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework is developed to estimate the fault distance for each line segment, with a whitening process applied to mitigate the effects of correlated noise. Subsequently, a candidate fault line segment is identified for each path from the substation to the end of each branch. Finally, the fault location is pinpointed within one of the candidate fault line segments, using the corresponding fault distance estimation result and the depth between the substation and candidate fault line segments, along with a truncated mean square error (MSE). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in PSCAD/EMTDC based on the IEEE 33-Bus and 123-Bus Test Feeders with various fault types, parameters and locations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy in fault location."

    "abstract": "The implementation of scalable and privacy-preserving models in nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) requires the usage of distributed pipelines through methods like federated learning. However, the differences between building locations, appliances, and consumption patterns create domain discrepancies that hinder performance. To address this issue, we need to apply domain adaptation while respecting the privacy constraint of federated learning. In this work, we propose adopting existing methods to act as discrepancy measures in the context of federated domain adaptation in NILM using a deep sparse coding model with novel modifications. These methods find the discrepancy between the local data and the target data and include: 1) a modified version of Federated domain adaptation (FedDA), which is based on the local variance and Euclidean distance; 2) FedRBF, which is based on the measure of similarity using the radial basis function kernel; 3) FedMMD, which is based on maximum mean discrepancy; and 4) FedkNN, which is based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Moreover, we propose a novel framework that adaptively combines all methods as a second intermediate layer by learning their contribution weights to the central server. This deep adaptive weighting framework aims to optimize the selection of the output weights of each method in a federated manner. We explore several techniques of weight computation that are based on the raw data or on learned representations that further preserve user consumption privacy. We find that every method performs better than regular federated averaging (FedAvg) by up to 5% in terms of disaggregation accuracy, while an additional increase for the adaptive weighting framework results. The suggested methods also perform better than training only on the target domain. We also find that basing the weights on locally learned representations yields similar results to using raw data."

    "abstract": "This study investigates price formation mechanisms in electricity markets with contrasting renewable penetration levels by examining the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) markets from 2021 to 2023. We employ a novel methodological approach to address a critical gap: while existing literature examines individual markets, the joint distributional and dynamic aspects of price formation, particularly during extreme events, remain poorly understood. Our innovative combination of quantile regression and modified Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process captures both how market drivers influence electricity prices across different market conditions and their subsequent adjustment patterns. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how these markets respond to load variations, renewable generation, and weather sensitivity. CAISO demonstrates consistently stronger price elasticities to load changes and temperature fluctuations. It also shows faster mean reversion rates, reflecting a market design optimized for renewable integration but with higher volatility. PJM exhibits more moderate responses and slower mean reversion, indicating greater price stability through resource diversity. During extreme events, these differences intensify significantly – CAISO exhibits enhanced price-suppressing effects from renewables during off-peak periods and intensified gas generation impacts during stress periods, while PJM maintains more stable price dynamics. These results suggest that successful renewable integration depends heavily on market structure, requiring regionally tailored approaches that balance short-term flexibility with long-term stability. The findings provide actionable insights for market operators and participants navigating the transition to higher renewable penetration. The robustness of our results is established through bootstrapping, threshold sensitivity analysis, and residual diagnostics to ensure reliability."

    "abstract": "While many visualizations are built for domain users (e.g., biologists, machine learning developers), understanding how visualizations are used in the domain has long been a challenging task. Previous research has relied on either interviewing a limited number of domain users or reviewing relevant application papers in the visualization community, neither of which provides comprehensive insight into visualizations “in the wild” of a specific domain. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining the potential of using Large Language Models (LLM) to analyze visualization usage in domain literature. We use high-dimension (HD) data visualization in sing-cell transcriptomics as a test case, analyzing 1,203 papers that describe 2,056 HD visualizations with highly specialized domain terminologies (e.g., biomarkers, cell lineage). To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a human-in-the-loop LLM workflow that can effectively analyze a large collection of papers and translate domain-specific terminology into standardized data and task abstractions. Instead of relying solely on LLMs for end-to-end analysis, our workflow enhances analytical quality through 1) integrating image processing and traditional NLP methods to prepare well-structured inputs for three targeted LLM subtasks (i.e., translating domain terminology, summarizing analysis tasks, and performing categorization), and 2) establishing checkpoints for human involvement and validation throughout the process. The analysis results, validated with expert interviews and a test set, revealed three often overlooked aspects in HD visualization: trajectories in HD spaces, inter-cluster relationships, and dimension clustering. This research provides a stepping stone for future studies seeking to use LLMs to bridge the gap between visualization design and domain-specific usage"

Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration.

    "abstract": "Errors in acoustic arrays can degrade detection performance by compromising the accuracy of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and reducing processing gain. Most conventional array calibration methods are based on far-field conditions, which are challenging to implement in confined spaces. In order to address this problem, we propose a self-calibration method for compensating gain-phase and position errors in linear acoustic arrays under near-field conditions. In this method, the DOA of the signal is used to estimate the array element positions, which are then fitted to the actual array, while the relative spatial positions of the source and the array are employed to refine the DOA estimation. This alternating iterative procedure enables the accurate estimation of both the DOA and array element errors. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Tank test results demonstrate that the accuracy of DOA estimation after array calibration is improved by an average of 0.2°, and the peak side lobe ratio (PSLR) of the beam pattern is reduced by an average of 2.03 dB."

    "abstract": "Through numerical simulation methods, this study investigated the influence of structural slots in the control surfaces of low-speed laminar-flow airfoils on their aerodynamic characteristics, and further proposed and analyzed multiple structural optimization schemes. The findings revealed that structural slots cause the high-pressure airflow from the lower surface of the airfoil to overflow onto the upper surface, resulting in a significant reduction in lift coefficient and a noticeable increase in drag coefficient within the angle of attack range of −6° to 8°. However, when the angle of attack exceeds 8°, the flow separation effect weakens, increasing the stall angle of attack and enhancing the maximum lift coefficient. Further investigations into various shape optimization schemes demonstrated that adding a horizontal baffle plate at the control surface cavity can reduce the upper surface slot flow by over 98%. Under low angle of attack conditions, the overflow of airflow on both the upper and lower surfaces is blocked. Preserving the high lift and low drag characteristics of the seamless airfoil. At the high angle of attack, the relatively high-velocity vortex-induced outflow at the slot region enhances the adhesion of upper surface airflow to the airfoil, maintaining the advantage of structural slots in delaying stall at the high angle of attack."

Furthermore, we assume that no feedback is present and no state information is available to either the transmitter or the receiver. We derive the highest transmission rates achievable for our channel under a given distortion constraint, for three different receiver schemes: simultaneous decoding and estimation, decoding before estimation, and estimation before decoding. The state estimator is based on the idea of coded sensing, i.e., it uses a lossy source coding codebook to determine the estimate of the state sequence. The results hint towards a trade-off among the performance limits of such ISAC systems."

We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation.

As part of a nationwide citizen science initiative, we carried out Italy’s first national survey of resin pellets. A total of 2,270 pellets were collected from 73 beaches across 13 Italian regions. These were analyzed based on morphological features, including discoloration, fouling, and porosity. From selected subsamples, four PAH and six PCB congeners were extracted and quantified. Pollutant concentrations showed a significant correlation with the yellowing index, further validating the use of resin pellets as an effective proxy for environmental pollution.

    "abstract": "Permutation codes are extensively studied because of applications such as frequency-shift keying modulation for power line communication (PLC). In PLC channels with synchronization issues, the error propagation due to insertion/deletion errors blurs the boundaries of codewords, thus making the communication unreliable. Prior studies on regaining synchronization focused on scenarios where noise and errors distort permutation codewords that were consecutively transmitted. In this paper, we consider the case where the channel output is a two-dimensional array, which is a concatenation of distorted permutation matrices of the transmitted codewords. Firstly, we propose algorithms to achieve two tasks. The first is to predict the distance of subarrays of the channel output from all codewords, and the second is to predict the original transmitted codewords given the output matrices corresponding to these codewords. Secondly, we apply these algorithms in an extended version of Viterbi-like algorithms proposed by Cheng et al. to decode the outputs received from transmissions over PLC channels with synchronization issues. Finally, our simulations demonstrate that block error rates were significantly improved over implementations lacking neural network-based algorithms, regardless of noise and error types."

Combining THz spectroscopy, microscopy, and ecotoxicological assays, we found that lead, copper, and chromium disrupt diatom metabolism, significantly reducing chain formation. While THz spectra remained unchanged in control samples, they were highly responsive to chain length variations caused by metal exposure.Our results show THz spectroscopy can probe metabolic processes in diatoms, offering a rapid, non-destructive method to assess heavy metal toxicity—supporting its use in environmental monitoring of marine pollutants."

    "abstract": "Satellite communication is expected to play a key role in future networks due to its ability to deliver wide-area coverage and high-capacity links. Inter-satellite communication (ISC), which facilitates real-time data exchange between satellites, is therefore critical for important satellite applications such as navigation, earth observation, and defense. However, the broadcast nature of the wireless medium renders ISC vulnerable to various security threats. In this paper, we investigate impersonation attack scenarios in LEO ISC and propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based physical layer authentication (PLA) scheme. The proposed method leverages Doppler frequency shift (DFS) features, arising from relative satellite motion, to enable secure authentication of the transmitting satellite. To address the challenge of acquiring ground-truth labels, we employ a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn temporal patterns from the satellite dynamics. A synthetic dataset simulating a 30-day mission involving three satellites (two legitimate and one malicious) is generated using a MATLAB-based orbital propagation method, incorporating 3D position and velocity vectors. The LSTM model is trained on 25 days of data from legitimate satellites and evaluated over the remaining 5 days using both legitimate and malicious transmissions. Authentication is performed via binary hypothesis testing, and we derive tractable analytical expressions for the false alarm and missed detection probabilities and validate the results through simulations."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of velocity control during the transition phase for Quad Tilt Rotor unmanned aerial vehicles. An optimized transition strategy is proposed, involving the design of an optimal transition trajectory that prioritizes stable attitude and minimizes a cost function incorporating low power consumption. This strategy is implemented with a sliding mode control law to ensure a smooth and stable tilt transition. The study first introduces the physical structure and control principles of the unmanned aerial vehicle. A comprehensive digital dynamics simulation model for the Quad Tilt Rotor is then established. Based on this dynamic model, velocity and attitude control laws are formulated, and system stability is analyzed. Furthermore, flight attitude during the transition process is optimized by dynamically adjusting nacelle tilt angle and control allocation weighting factors in response to longitudinal velocity. Finally, comparative simulations against a predefined transition trajectory control method validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "A visual cryptography scheme is a secret sharing scheme in which the secret information is an image and the shares are printed on transparencies, so that the secret image can be recovered by simply stacking the shares on top of each other. Such schemes do therefore not require any knowledge of cryptography tools to recover the secret, and they have widespread applications, for example, when sharing QR codes or medical images.In this work we deal with visual cryptography threshold schemes for color images. Our color model differs from most previous work by allowing arbitrary colors to be stacked, resulting in a possibly different color. This more general color monoid model enables us to achieve shorter pixel expansion and higher contrast than comparable schemes. We revisit the polynomial framework of Koga and Ishihara for constructing visual cryptography schemes and apply the monoid ring to obtain new schemes for color visual cryptography."

    "abstract": "Acoustic transducers for underwater communications are one of the most expensive components of underwater acoustic modems and their applications. Their production involves the use of expensive materials, such as piezoelectric ceramic rings, tubes, or spheres, and molding materials, which are difficult to operate due to their sensitivity to humidity, temperature, and vibrations. Moreover, it is not easy to automate this process, which mostly results in a specialized operator spending a few hours to manufacture and calibrate each handmade transducer, and in a final price that is often more than 2000 USD per unit. Therefore, such transducers are used only in high-power underwater acoustic modems for defense and Oil&Gas applications, making them not suitable for low-cost deployment such as communication systems for divers, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarms [1] or sensors networks for coastal monitoring. To enable such applications, different alternatives have been proposed, from using other components, such as fish-finders and hydrophones with low transmitting voltage response [2], to homemade low-cost transducers [3]. In this paper, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both solutions, presenting our experience and the lessons we learned while producing our lowcost transducer, which is a key element for underwater communication and its application in coastal monitoring deployments."

    "abstract": "The axial turbine is a key energy-releasing component in the Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system, and the geometry of the radial inlet chamber (RIC) directly affects the aerodynamic performance of the turbine. In this study, the influence of RIC geometric parameters on turbine performance was investigated using the orthogonal experimental design. The orthogonal experimental schemes were established with four levels of chamber width (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$b$</tex>), chamber height <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(h)$</tex>, axial clearance <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(d)$</tex>, bend length <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(L)$</tex>, and corner radius (R). The isentropic efficiency, mass flow rate, RIC outlet velocity inhomogeneity, and total pressure distortion of each scheme were obtained by numerical simulation. The effects of geometric parameters were determined through range analysis. The results indicate that the order of geometric parameters on the isentropic efficiency and mass flow rate is characterized by the relation <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$h&gt;b&gt;d&gt;L&gt;R$</tex>. The isentropic efficiency is highest when the chamber height is 1.29 times the height of the first stage stator <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\left(H_{S}\\right)$</tex>, while other parameters all exhibit positive correlations with isentropic efficiency. Regarding the RIC outlet velocity inhomogeneity, all parameters have insignificant effects. Increased chamber volume reduces the low-pressure region at the bottom and the internal corners, thereby demonstrating that the chamber height and chamber width have significant effects on the total pressure distortion. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical foundation for RIC design and practical guidance for related engineering applications."

It is imperative to have a proficient e-health monitoring system capable of detecting anomalies in real time and assisting specialists in formulating diagnoses based on the collected data. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been effectively implemented across numerous industrial sectors, with notable applications in automation, monitoring, healthcare, and biomedical engineering. Hospitals and private medical centers employ IoT technology to enhance patient health. This work falls within the e-health context, utilizing IoT and 5 G connectivity to remotely monitor heart patients. The proposed system utilizes sensors embedded in a handheld device to observe the patient’s Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings and instantly inform doctors or caregivers whether or not the values are within the standard range. 5 G mobile networks enable each connected object owned by dependent people to connect to a cloud server. Critical data is collected and shared using portable sensors, which are then transmitted to secure fog/cloud computing devices for analysis. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector is rapidly expanding, with applications that enhance human activities, particularly in the healthcare domain. AI is increasingly important in e-health through the evolution of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). In this paper, we used DL as a technique for the analysis and processing of the collected data. The results demonstrate that our proposed model enables suitable classification in the ECG domain with accuracy levels of $100 \\%$ and $98.02 \\%$ for the training and validation phases, respectively."

In this paper, the night vision compatible illumination mode of the cockpit of an aircraft is simulated, and the typical sky light environment is considered, which includes four ambient illumination levels: direct sunlight on sunny days, sunny days, cloudy days, and nighttime. Under dynamic ambient light conditions, by comparing the visual pictures of the cockpit display device, the chromaticity and chromaticity uniformity of the display characters are analyzed and discussed. Through the experimental study of aircraft cockpit lighting, it is concluded that there is no color difference in character display in night vision compatible lighting mode under different ambient illumination and display brightness except for NVIS green A, and the color display consistency of each color is good. But under the blue-white illumination standard system, white color has a larger color difference at low ambient illumination and low display brightness levels, and red color has a larger color difference at high ambient illumination and high display brightness levels."

However, selecting a protocol that satisfies the requirements for device anonymity, mutual authentication between entities within the 5G network, and resistance to various attacks such as replay attacks, association attacks, and DoS/DDoS attacks necessitates a robust protocol analysis method. ProVerif serves as an automated verification tool designed for the modeling and analysis of cryptographic protocols. The system accepts a protocol description as input and utilizes Pi calculus to verify security properties. The security properties are represented as queries related to derivability, utilizing Horn clauses as the foundational framework. The paper presents an analysis of the modeling process for a blockchain-based 5G authentication and key agreement protocol, utilizing the ProVerif tool for verification purposes. The results from ProVerif confirm that all specified properties of the protocol yield a “true” outcome, thereby illustrating the protocol’s robustness against both active and passive attacks within the system."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for reliable Internet access during air travel has made in-flight connectivity (IFC) a critical service for commercial airlines. Traditional IFC systems rely on geostationary (GEO) satellites, but their high latency and limited bandwidth hinder user experience. Emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, such as Starlink, promise better network performance. This paper presents the first empirical comparison of IFC performance across GEO and LEO networks, using data from 25 flights operated by 7 airlines. Measurements collected via instrumented Android devices cover key metrics including latency, throughput, and CDN responsiveness. We observe that while GEO systems rely on static and often distant Internet gateways, Starlink clients connect to different gateways that align more closely with flight trajectories, enhancing end-to-end performance through shorter satellite paths. However, DNS-based content filtering on Starlink-equipped flights often affects user geolocation, introducing unnecessary terrestrial delays. Finally, our case study of TCP performance from 2 Starlink flights shows that the BBR congestion control algorithm delivers up to 35× higher throughput than Cubic and Vegas, but with significantly higher retransmissions due to aggressive bandwidth probing."

In this paper, we present Wook, a novel high throughput downlink system to empower Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices to transmit high-speed OOK messages. The key innovation underpinning Wook is its ability to achieve sub-symbol level modulation, allowing a single OFDM symbol to carry multiple OOK bits. This is done by profoundly exploring the Wi-Fi PHY layer and identifying optimal input payload to achieve fine-grained Wi-Fi waveform manipulation. We fabricate a PCB prototype and employ the COTS Wi-Fi router to implement the entire system. Experimental results show that with a simulated IC power consumption 76.6μW, Wook achieves a data rate of up to 1.1 Mbps, an 8.9X improvement over state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, even at a communication distance of 95 m, Wook maintains a throughput of 82.9 Kbps."

While O-RAN offers greater flexibility and stimulates innovation, it also introduces potential issues such as bugs, inconsistencies, and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a novel model-based fuzzing system, ARCANE, to address these challenges. Unlike existing fuzzing techniques that struggle with the complexity and dynamism of O-RAN, ARCANE distinguishes itself by employing a smart, model-based approach. It first analyzes O-RAN specifications using a Large Language Model (LLM) and incorporates a unique method that integrates passive model learning to refine the model. With this refined model, ARCANE designs an O-RAN-aware, model-based fuzzing scheme that maintains high efficiency by adhering to O-RAN's specific semantics and syntax. We implement ARCANE and evaluate it on the OAI5G. It finds 9 root bugs from three categories, all having serious security implications. ARCANE has shown superior efficiency and coverage compared to state-of-the-arts."

However, traditional TBUT assessments rely on costly and time-consuming clinical procedures, while existing home-based solutions fail to provide precise TBUT values. In this work, we present Blinic, a contactless system leveraging commercial millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar to predict precise TBUT values and assess DED severity grades at home. Blinic incorporates detailed blink kinematics that are closely linked to TBUT. To address the challenge of predicting TBUT directly from radar data, we propose a teacher-student learning framework. The teacher model, trained on electronic health records (EHRs) including image-based diagnostic tests, transfers medical insights to the student model, which uses radar-captured blink dynamics. This knowledge transfer is further enhanced by a fine-tuned large language model, DryEye-LLM, which is based on clinical diagnostic reports and employs unsupervised domain adaptation to align EHRs with radar data. To ensure accurate blink motion capture, Blinic employs an antenna-coded MIMO mmWave radar design. Additionally, a query-based multitask learning module simultaneously predicts TBUT and DED severity grades, addressing potential conflicts in feature representation. Evaluated on 192 participants in collaboration with an eye clinic, Blinic demonstrates achieving a mean absolute error of 2.73 seconds for TBUT with an average accuracy of 90.54% for DED grading in real-world settings, providing a practical solution for home-based DED management."

A hybrid fault tolerance mechanism is also devised to proactively manage potential device and network failures.

Specifically, RMMSC improves the accuracy of multimodal semantic information through advanced semantic encoding and cross-modal feature integration. It employs a two-level coding scheme that combines error-correcting codes with semantic encoders to enhance the reliability of multimodal semantic transmission. As an optional design choice, RMMSC supports a hybrid encryption mechanism to protect transmitted data if required by the application context. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of RMMSC, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and reliability for the AVE task."

These patterns, or network motifs, can often be detected algorithmically. However, visual inspection remains vital for exploring and discovering patterns. This paper focuses on presenting motifs within BioFabric network visualizations-a unique technique that opens opportunities for research on scaling to larger networks, design variations, and layout algorithms to better expose motifs. Our goal is to show how highlighting motifs can assist users in identifying and interpreting patterns in BioFabric visualizations. To this end, we leverage existing motif simplification techniques. We replace edges with glyphs representing fundamental motifs such as staircases, cliques, paths, and connector nodes. The results of our controlled experiment and usage scenarios demonstrate that motif simplification for BioFabric is useful for detecting and interpreting network patterns. Our participants were faster and more confident using the simplified view without sacrificing accuracy. The efficacy of our current motif simplification approach depends on which extant layout algorithm is used. We hope our promising findings on user performance will motivate future research on layout algorithms tailored to maximizing motif presentation."

Therefore, a single waveform is inadequate to be uniformly adopted in ISTNs, further aggravated by the difficulty in upgrading satellite hardware. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a soft approach capable of switching between traditional waveforms while maintaining reliable communication under adverse conditions. A fractional dual index transform is introduced, enabling seamless switching and fusion across time, frequency, delay, and Doppler domains through two tunable indices. Based on this, fractional dual index division multiplexing (FDIDM) is designed along with input-output relationships and feasible decoders. FDIDM generalizes typical waveforms like OFDM and OTFS as special cases with the same complexity and improves performance through indices optimization at the cost of additional computational overhead. Theoretical analysis is conducted to obtain the closed-form symbol error rate (SER) and performance boundaries of FDIDM. Simulation results validate the deduction and demonstrate the advantages of cross-domain modulation over existing waveforms."

    "abstract": "A method based on composite with phase-controlled acoustic metastructures (acoustic focusing lenses) to modulate the frequency response characteristics of fiber optic acoustic sensors (OAS) is proposed. Based on the MZ-SI optical path structure, different numbers of V-shaped unit cell arrays were designed to form acoustic focusing lenses (AFLs) with editable focusing bands, resulting in a composite optical fiber acoustic sensor (COAS). The AFL generates acoustic focusing within a specific frequency band, thereby compensating for the frequency response of the COAS in that band. Compared with the conventional OAS, the COAS improves the average frequency response by 9.79 dB, the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by 8.7 dB, and the average minimum detectable pressure (MDP) by about 2.4 times in the 9.5-13.8 kHz frequency band, resulting in higher responsiveness to real-world audio tests. In addition, the frequency band boosted by COAS also shows consistency with the simulation results, proving the applicability of this method."

    "abstract": "The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications. Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet, a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout, enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions. CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios."

    "abstract": "We present a new comprehensive theory for explaining, exploring, and using pattern as a visual variable in visualization. Although patterns have long been used for data encoding and continue to be valuable today, their conceptual foundations are precarious: the concepts and terminology used across the research literature and in practice are inconsistent, making it challenging to use patterns effectively and to conduct research to inform their use. To address this problem, we conduct a comprehensive cross-disciplinary literature review that clarifies ambiguities around the use of “pattern” and “texture”. As a result, we offer a new consistent treatment of pattern as a composite visual variable composed of structured groups of graphic primitives that can serve as marks for encoding data individually and collectively. This new and widely applicable formulation opens a sizable design space for the visual variable pattern, which we formalize as a new system comprising three sets of variables: the spatial arrangement of primitives, the appearance relationships among primitives, and the retinal visual variables that characterize individual primitives. We show how our pattern system relates to existing visualization theory and highlight opportunities for visualization design. We further explore patterns based on complex spatial arrangements, demonstrating explanatory power and connecting our conceptualization to broader theory on maps and cartography.

    "abstract": "The accurate analysis of trap behavior in field-effect transistor (FET) signals affected by random telegraph noise (RTN) is complicated by superimposed low and high frequency noise, which obscures trap characteristics and hampers reliable time constant extraction. A fully automated algorithm is introduced for extracting RTN parameters, which separates a signal into high and low frequency components, preserving high-frequency integrity for independent analysis. This frequency decomposition reduces the median error rate from approximately 57% to 16% in complex 2-trap signals under moderate background noise, significantly improving error rates and expanding the range of extractable time constants. To benchmark the algorithm’s error rate for both single and multiple trap signals, synthetic RTN datasets with known parameters and varying background noise levels are generated. Additionally, a figure of merit for RTN noise is defined, calculating the percentage of noise attributable to RTN in a device or signal to facilitate device-to-device comparisons. Applying this methodology to various transistors, low-voltage pFETs are observed to be least impacted by RTN, whereas high-voltage buried channel pFETs exhibit the highest percentage of noise originating from RTN."

    "abstract": "Passive radar systems have gained significant attention due to their stealth operation and infrastructure-free implementation. Such systems typically rely on micro-Doppler (MD) features generated from micro-motions of structural components such as rotating blades as key discriminative features for target recognition. However, the time-frequency representation (TFR) becomes blurry due to noise contamination and complex superposition of instantaneous frequency (IF) components, presenting significant challenges for passive radar systems in analyzing MD signals (MDSs). To address these limitations, this paper proposes an enhanced adaptive chirp mode decomposition (ACMD) method incorporating sparsity-based IF optimization. By introducing IF smoothing terms and sparse regularization of their spectrum in the ACMD framework, it is possible to suppress abrupt changes caused by noise and modes far from the IF, as well as oscillations caused by noise around the IF. Both synthetic and real-world data validations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting MDSs from multiple IF components superposition scenarios."

    "abstract": "Owing to the resilience in structure and adaptability to the environment, tensegrity robots have a variety of potential applications in environmental exploration, search and rescue, and other fields. However, the interaction with the environment could be unpredictable, which requires the robots to be equipped with the ability of environment perception. This article presents a junction tensegrity robot (JTBot), which consists of both flexible and rigid struts, for the inspection of unstructured pipelines. Slender elastic beams are utilized to replace the rigid rods to enhance the robot’s dexterity and flexibility by generating large-scale deformations. Compact deflection sensors are embedded onto the flexible struts to enable the JTBot with the capability to estimate its equilibrium state and to predict the contact conditions with the environment. A closed-form model of the robot’s kinetostatics is established to characterize the interaction behavior of such a cable-constrained flexible mechanism efficiently. Hence, in situ gait optimization can be implemented for the crawling robot with the aid of the intrinsic environmental perception. A prototype of the JTBot is developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design, on which a variety of validation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the developed JTBot is able to pass through complex pipelines in a dexterous way. In addition, a demonstration is provided to illustrate the JTBot’s capability of defect detection in unstructured pipelines."

Given the widespread distribution of data across different domains, integrating and analyzing these datasets through outsourced cloud computing can enhance analytics, though privacy concerns arise. Privacy preserving data analysis, underpinned by secure multi-party computing, emerges as a crucial approach to address this challenge. However, existing efforts face high communication costs and increased interactions, resulting in significant efficiency constraints in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a function secret sharing (FSS)-based framework for secure collaborative analysis of time series data using the DTW algorithm. Utilizing the distributed comparison function, we develop efficient building blocks with minimal online interaction and communication, enhancing the practicability of security protocols. To address the challenges of FSS key generation due to uncertain computational topology when cascading multiple distances, we adopt a modular design and decompose the analysis process into several critical modules. Furthermore, our framework efficiently supports various constraint methods for DTW. We implement and evaluate our framework using publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in communication costs and the number of interactions during the online phase."

    "abstract": "Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using graph-based features only. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses graph-based features only as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.05)."

This biomimetic approach specifically emulates the density variations observed within the ribs of the turtle carapace. The mechanical response of this structure under impact loading conditions was investigated through numerical simulation in depth. Comparative analysis showed that the bionic gradient core structures have significant performance advantages over conventional sandwich structures with a homogeneous core. Specifically, the bionic gradient core structures, which have similar density variations to the ribs of the turtle carapace, have smaller deformation values at the back panel centre and greater energy absorption values compared to the traditional sandwich structure with a homogenous core. Overall, natural organisms not only provide feasible inspiration for structural design, but bionic structures also enable better mechanical performance in engineering applications. This finding provides a new idea as well as a reference for designing structures that have both lightweighting and excellent mechanical properties."

Here, we propose the opposite, where we utilize the receiver’s sensing capabilities for communication. Our goal is to characterize the fundamental limits of communication over such a channel, which we call ‘communication via sensing’. We assume that changes in the sensed attributes, such as location and speed, are limited due to practical constraints, which are captured by assuming a finite-state channel (FSC) with an input cost constraint. We first formulate an upper bound on the N-letter capacity as a cost-constrained optimization problem over the input sequence distribution, and then convert it to an equivalent problem over the state sequence distribution. Moreover, by breaking a walk on the underlying Markov chain into a weighted sum of traversed graph cycles in the long walk limit, we obtain a compact single-letter formulation of the capacity upper bound. Finally, for a specific case of a two-state FSC with noisy sensing characterized by a binary symmetric channel (BSC), we obtain a closed-form expression for the capacity upper bound. Comparison with an existing numerical lower bound shows that our proposed upper bound is very tight for all crossover probabilities."

Shadows cast by tall buildings and other structures frequently obscure critical details, leading to pricey errors when these images are used in smart city urban geographic information systems. In this research, we propose a novel convolution-based algorithm for effective detection and minimization of buildings’ shadows. The proposed approach iteratively applies a set of operations. First, we split the patch into successive sub-patches. Second, we mix every subsequent corrected and uncorrected $N / 2 \\times N$ patches together into a new rebuilt patch. This mathematically implements a convolution processing function to the image sub-patches. For instance, an N pixel width filter is applied on the rebuilt patch, in order to simultaneously detect and correct/minimize its specific shading. Once all the patches are iteratively covered/processed, the whole corrected image is reconstructed. The proposed algorithm is applied to satellite images from Google Earth and the obtained results are presented with respect to the translation patch size. The performance is evaluated in terms of quantitative metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Method (SSIM), and processing time. Additionally, histogram analysis of the input and output images is performed to assess changes in luminance distribution and to visually confirm the reduction of shadow artifacts. The proposed method demonstrates promising results for improving the quality of satellite imagery used in urban analysis."

    "abstract": "The Digital-Med project addresses the growing need for reliable and accessible data to support the development of offshore renewable energy technologies, with a particular emphasis on offshore wind farms in the Mediterranean Sea. The initiative focuses on creating a digital platform that integrates both numerical datasets from large-scale reanalysis models and experimental data gathered through in situ measurement campaigns at selected sites in southern Italy. These sites will host advanced instrumentation, including LIDAR for wind profiling, Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers for measuring waves and currents, surface buoys for real-time monitoring, hydrophones for assessing underwater noise, and CTD probes for environmental observations. The platform will combine these heterogeneous datasets into a unified system, providing both raw and processed information to facilitate environmental characterization, technology evaluation, and decision-making. Through a user-oriented web interface, it will offer functionalities such as GIS-based spatial analysis, resource assessment under present and future scenarios, technology performance estimation, and economic evaluation. By bridging experimental evidence and digital infrastructure, Digital Med will reduce uncertainties in site selection and system design, promote sustainable marine spatial planning, and support the deployment of offshore renewable energy in the Mediterranean, contributing to the broader goals of the European energy transition."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet, particularly the rapid growth of social networks and online platforms, has facilitated the widespread dissemination of fake, toxic, and reactionary news content. In the context of Vietnam, reactionary news, such as online articles that disseminate false information or incite division within the national unity bloc, poses a significant societal threat due to its rapid propagation and diverse modalities of expression, including text, images, videos, or multimodal combinations thereof. Given the increasing prevalence and severity of such content in cyberspace, numerous studies have been conducted domestically and internationally to address its detection and mitigation. However, the majority of existing approaches primarily target English-language content. Moreover, the processing of news presented in non-textual formats, such as text embedded in images or videos, remains a major challenge, often resulting in reduced detection performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a multimodal detection model that integrates semi-supervised learning with the PhoBERT language model and Swin Transformer V2 for identifying toxic news represented in both textual and visual forms. The adoption of semi-supervised learning minimizes the dependence on large-scale labeled datasets while maintaining high detection performance. Experimental evaluations conducted on a dataset comprising 8,000 Vietnamese news articles in text and image formats demonstrate that the proposed multimodal model significantly outperforms both unimodal and previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an F1-score of 90.99% using only 30% labeled data."

Conventional reliability analysis methods for ballistic performance parameters typically treat each parameter as an independent variable, thereby inadvertently omitting critical reliability information and complicating the assessment of performance reliability under small-sample conditions. This study develops a multidimensional joint distribution model through a comprehensive correlation analysis of interior ballistic performance parameters and subsequently employs this model to evaluate the reliability of interior ballistic performance. Comparative analysis demonstrates that, under identical data conditions, characterizing the probability distribution of multiple random variables via a high-dimensional joint distribution enables more effective extraction of reliable information from limited samples. This approach provides a robust analytical framework for performance reliability assessment in scenarios constrained by small sample sizes."

The study revealed disappointingly low 5G coverage and suboptimal network performance -- falling short of the expectations needed to support the new generation of 5G ''killer apps. Now, five years into the 5G era, widely considered its midlife, 5G networks are expected to deliver stable and mature performance. In this work, we replicate the 2022 study along the same coast-to-coast route, evaluating the current state of cellular coverage and network and application performance across all three major US operators. While we observe a substantial increase in 5G coverage and a corresponding boost in network performance, two out of three operators still exhibit less than 50% 5G coverage along the driving route even five years after the initial 5G rollout. We expand the scope of the previous work by analyzing key lower-layer KPIs that directly influence the network performance. Finally, we introduce a head-to-head comparison with Starlink's LEO satellite network to assess whether emerging non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) can complement the terrestrial cellular infrastructure in the next generation of wireless connectivity."

We contextualize our analysis by framing the capacity of satellite networks relative to lost capacity due to submarine cable failure. Specifically, we focus on scenarios where LEO networks act as failovers for submarine cables, providing a concrete target capacity to be fulfilled by the satellite network. We introduce a new model and simulator that help us estimate the failover capacity. We identify key factors determining the actual capacity available on the satellite network: the total area of the country, the terminal distribution policy used by the government, the spectrum allocation and traffic engineering policies used by the LEO network operator. Based on our findings, we make policy recommendations to governments that can result in an increase of up to 1.8× in the failover capacity without requiring additional infrastructure. However, we find after implementing all our recommendations, with 200k terminals deployed and no competing traffic in the network, a satellite network can only satisfy 0.9-14.7% of the capacity lost due to submarine cable failure in four out of six case studies."

In [5], the authors examine the HTTP/1.1 ~protocol and demonstrate that assessing the compliance of a remote implementation with respect to its RFC ~is challenging, as middleboxes on the network path can alter application-layer content. This paper builds on their work by focusing on HTTP/2, a more efficient yet more complex protocol that is known to be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. We create a suite of 156 tests, more than three times the number conducted on HTTP/1.1, and analyze 12 popular proxies as well as 3 cloud proxies. This work not only investigates the current landscape of proxy implementations with respect to RFCs, but also examines the evolution of compliance over time in local proxies. We show that while there is an improvement compared to previous results in HTTP/1.1, none of the proxies are yet fully compliant."

Current taste perception techniques usually require expensive equipment and delicate storage conditions, which restrict their use primarily to laboratory settings. In this paper, we show that terahertz (THz) signals generate unique fingerprint spectra when interacting with different taste molecules in aqueous solutions. Building on this finding, we propose Molecular-level Taste Sensing (MoleSen), a contact-free gustatory sensing method aimed at achieving wireless human-like perception. Specifically, MoleSen emits terahertz signals towards the aqueous solution, captures the reflected signals, and then determines the type and concentration of the tastes by analyzing the unique fingerprint spectra of the reflected signals influenced by the taste molecules. In MoleSen, we design a bio-inspired deep learning model (DTB, Digital Taste Bud) to identify the subtle taste features diluted by water molecules. Additionally, we incorporate domain adaptive learning to address the issue of feature distribution shifts when multiple tastes are mixed. Through extensive experiments involving over 247,000 samples, we demonstrate that MoleSen can accurately differentiate the five basic tastes—sour, bitter, salty, sweet, and umami—with an accuracy of 98.5% for taste type determination and 96.9% for concentration detection. Moreover, MoleSen outperforms the human's taste sensitivity and achieves a highly accurate perception even for mixed tastes."

However, the monostatic configuration of off-the-shelf radars limits spatial coverage and often misses reflections that scatter away from the receiver. Bistatic radars, with spatially separated transmitter and receiver, can capture these additional scattering paths, providing bistatic radar cross-section (RCS) information. However, a key challenge is the need for continuous phase synchronization between transceivers. Traditional solutions rely on costly ultra-stable oscillators, fiber links, or shared external clocks. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of bistatic FMCW sensing with only frame-level synchronization. We demonstrate the feasibility of bistatic tracking of a single object movement and range estimation using two TI AWR1843 radars at 77 GHz with frame-level synchronization through a shared hardware trigger."

    "abstract": "Traditional 3D content representations include dense point clouds that consume large amounts of data and hence network bandwidth, while newer representations such as neural radiance fields suffer from poor frame rates due to their nonstandard volumetric rendering pipeline. 3D Gaussian splats (3DGS) can be seen as a generalization of point clouds that meet the best of both worlds, with high visual quality and efficient rendering for real-time frame rates. However, delivering 3DGS scenes from a hosting server to client devices is still challenging due to high network data consumption (e.g., 1.5 GB for a single scene). The goal of this work is to create an efficient 3D content delivery framework that allows users to view high quality 3D scenes with 3DGS as the underlying data representation. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) Creating new layered 3DGS scenes for efficient delivery, (2) Scheduling algorithms to choose what splats to download at what time, and (3) Trace-driven experiments from users wearing virtual reality headsets to evaluate the visual quality and latency. Our system for Layered 3D Gaussian Splats delivery (L3GS) demonstrates high visual quality, achieving 16.9% higher average SSIM compared to baselines, and also works with other compressed 3DGS representations.

We introduce a new communication-efficient paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Our evaluations show that we can match cloud-based GPU training using a large collection of edge devices, achieving 4–10x speedup over edge methods."

Exploiting the heterogeneous capabilities of edge LLMs is crucial for emerging applications, enabling greater cost-effectiveness and reduced latency. In this work, we introduce Mixture-of-Edge-Experts (MoE2), a collaborative inference framework for edge LLMs. We formulate the joint gating and expert selection problem to optimize inference under energy and latency constraints. Unlike conventional MoE problems, expert selection here is more challenging due to the combinatorial nature and heterogeneity of edge LLMs. To address this, we propose a two-level expert selection mechanism and uncover an optimality-preserving property of gating parameters that decouples training and selection, reducing complexity. We further leverage the objective's monotonicity and design a discrete monotonic optimization algorithm. Implemented on Jetson Orin and RTX 4090 platforms, MoE2 achieves optimal trade-offs across delay and energy budgets, outperforming baselines under various resource constraints."

We propose ReliableSketch, the first to control the error of all keys to less than ? with a small failure probability ?, requiring only O(1 + ? ln ln(N/?)) amortized time and O(N/? + ln(1/?)) space. Furthermore, its simplicity makes it hardware-friendly, and we implement it on CPU servers, FPGAs, and programmable switches. Our experiments show that under the same small space, ReliableSketch not only keeps all keys' errors below ? but also delivers competitive throughput among accuracy-oriented baselines, outperforming competitors with thousands of uncontrolled estimations.

    "abstract": "Identifying the hierarchical heavy hitters (HHHs), i.e., the frequent aggregated flows based on common IP prefixes, is a vital task in network traffic measurement and security. Existing methods typically employ dynamic trie structures to track numerous prefixes or utilize multiple separate sketch instances, one for each hierarchical level, to capture HHHs across different levels, while both approaches suffer from low memory efficiency and limited compatibility with programmable switches. In this paper, we introduce two novel HHH detection solutions, respectively, Hierarchical Heavy Detector (HHD) and the Compressed Hierarchical Heavy Detector (CHHD), to achieve high memory efficiency and enhanced hardware compatibility. The key idea of HHD is to design a shared bucket array structure to identify and record HHHs from all hierarchical levels, which avoids the memory wastage of maintaining separate sketches to achieve high memory efficiency and allows feasible deployment of both byte-hierarchy and bit-hierarchy HHH detection on programmable switches using minimal processing stage resources. Additionally, HHD utilizes a sampling-based update strategy to effectively balance packet processing speed and detection accuracy. Furthermore, we present the CHHD, which enhances HHH detection in bit hierarchies through a more compact cell structure, which allows for compressing several ancestor and descendant prefixes within a single cell, further boosting memory efficiency and accuracy. We have implemented HHD and CHHD on a P4-based programmable switch with limited switch resources. Experimental results based on real-world Internet traces demonstrate that HHD and CHHD outperform the state-of-the-art by achieving up to 56 percentage points higher detection precision and 2.6× higher throughput."

    "abstract": "Non-contact measurements are gradually being applied to the analysis of rotating body vibration signals as an effective measurement method. In fact, whether based on vision or other non-contact vibration measurement methods, monitoring equipment will have positional shifts during long-term service, and the problem is usually solved by using mechanical stabilization or compensating for equipment variations through electronic stabilization algorithms. However, this additional monitoring cost still does not reliably compensate for small monitoring equipment shifts. To this end, we use a high-speed industrial camera controlled by a vertically moving platform to capture rotor vibration images, enabling state monitoring of rotating bodies under conditions of camera collinear displacement. Camera position estimation is simplified by utilizing stationary targets as references, enabling the effective estimation of the collinear displacement of the camera without introducing additional computational overhead to the segmentation algorithm. We propose the rotating body UNet (RotUNet), an enhanced UNet-based framework that combines a masked target center extraction method with a camera motion compensation technique to accurately extract the true vibration displacement of the rotating body. A convolutional processing unit, CGConv, is constructed to handle grouped features using convolutions of different sizes for cross-processing. This unit is capable of fusing features with different receptive fields. Additionally, a feature reconstruction module, SR-UP, is designed to integrate features with different resolutions, effectively enhancing the feature extraction ability of the convolutional layer and improving both the segmentation accuracy of the rotating body target and the vibration displacement monitoring accuracy. Meanwhile, on the base dataset, the root mean square error of the rotor (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE_R</i>) of DeepLabv3+ is 5.93% lower than that of the next best algorithm, UNet.

    "abstract": "Amidst the diverse computational and communication capabilities of the resource-constrained edge devices (EDs), synchronous model aggregation in wireless federated learning (FL) often suffers from inefficiencies due to stragglers, which diminishes learning efficiency. Conversely, asynchronous aggregation contends with delayed model updates, leading to staleness that adversely affects convergence and overall learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Genetic Algorithm (GA) Tuned Semi-Asynchronous FL (GATune-SAFL) strategy, which leverages the strengths of both synchronous and asynchronous FL while mitigating their inherent drawbacks. Specifically, a GA evolves a population of staleness parameter sets in each training round to achieve an optimal balance between learning latency and accuracy. Recognizing that data heterogeneity among edge devices may introduce biases in global model updates, we also propose Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment to further enhance model performance. Theoretically, we analyze the impact of staleness in different rounds on the convergence bound of GATune-SAFL, showing that GA-based staleness tuning significantly improves learning performance by accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy. Experimental results on the MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms benchmark FL algorithms in both convergence speed and learning accuracy."

    "abstract": "A wideband end-fire millimeter-wave (mmWave) dissymmetric bowtie magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna is proposed to enhance radiation pattern uniformity and minimize both boresight and off-boresight gain variation. At 45 GHz, the symmetric bowtie ME dipole antenna exhibits a distorted radiation pattern and excessive gain in the boresight direction due to a strong E-field between the arms with a narrow radiation angle. To overcome these limitations, the proposed antenna decreases the bowtie arm angle, thereby reducing E-field concentration. Consequently, the dissymmetric bowtie enables broader traveling-wave propagation and suppresses excessive gain increases in the boresight direction. Moreover, the antenna gain can be controlled above 35 GHz by adjusting the bowtie angle, maintaining a wide bandwidth and low boresight gain variation in the low-frequency band."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the physical layer security of free-space optical (FSO) communication from a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite to a high-altitude platform (HAP), in the presence of an eavesdropping HAP. Existing works typically assume identical channel statistics for both legitimate and eavesdropping HAPs, while favoring the legitimate one by presuming it captures a larger fraction of the optical beam power. In this work, we consider a more realistic model in which pointing errors (PEs) cause random beam displacements relative to the legitimate and eavesdropping HAPs, directly determining their received power. Assuming the satellite has access only to statistical channel state information of both HAPs, we derive closed-form expressions for connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) to characterize the reliability and secrecy performance of the system. Through detailed analysis of COP and SOP, we reveal a fundamental reliability-secrecy trade-off in beam divergence angle (BDA). We then formulate an optimization problem that jointly optimizes BDA and wiretap code rates to maximize the system's secrecy throughput under both reliability and secrecy constraints. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm providing the optimal solution, and also a low-complexity algorithm that yields the optimal solution in most practical scenarios. Numerical results demonstrate that the systems designed by the proposed algorithms achieve significantly improved secrecy throughput compared to conventional systems without the BDA optimization."

In order to improve the reliability of the track detectors applied in radiation environments, two radiation-hardened latch designs based on magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) are proposed in this paper. The proposed latches employ the hybrid CMOS/MTJ circuit structure to achieve non-volatility. To address the issue of insufficient radiation tolerance in traditional pre-charge sense amplifier (PCSA) circuits, an improved PCSA architecture (IPCSA) is adopted. The proposed PLATCH-1 employs two copies of the IPCSA units and a couple of two-input C-elements to achieve SNU recovery while PLATCH-2 employs three identical copies and 2 three-input C-elements to achieve DNU tolerance. Simulation results show that when the radiation charge is 2pC, the PLATCH-1 latch recoveries from all the single-node-upsets (SNUs) and the PLATCH-2 latch is all double-node-upsets (DNUs) tolerant. This work provides a feasible design for the utilization of MTJ memory devices in the sequential logic circuits and holds great significance in the high energy physics experiment applications within aerospace radiation environments."

    "abstract": "Future fusion devices rely on the use of high-field magnetic systems built with high-temperature superconductors (HTS). The interaction between intense magnetic fields and large operating currents induces significant mechanical stresses, which limit the deployment of HTS in fusion magnets. Efficient and reliable analysis tools are therefore essential to evaluate mechanical integrity during the early stages of design. CIRCE (Cast3M Investigation and Research for Coils mechanical Evaluation) is a mechanical toolbox developed to provide fast and parametric assessments of coil systems. It combines simplified electromagnetic and mechanical formulations within a fully parametric framework, enabling magnet designers to identify critical stress regions and determine optimal coil shapes for a given plasma configuration. This paper presents recent updates to CIRCE. A new regularized Biot-Savart formulation enables Lorentz force computation for arbitrary coil geometries. The mechanical beam model has been enhanced and extended to support non-planar coils. Additionally, a local 2D axisymmetric model has been implemented to evaluate transverse stresses at the conductor level. These improvements have been applied to the DEMO-LAR Tokamak and HELIAS 5-B baselines."

Although the integration of AI with LSS has been identified as a critical area of research, existing review studies have yet to present an in-depth analysis of this intersection. This study aims to uncover critical knowledge clusters and propose future research directions on the integration of AI with LSS. It also seeks to develop an integrative framework elucidating the role of AI in enhancing an organization's dynamic capabilities. A systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to synthesize existing research and identify thematic structures. Our analysis reveals that AI research within the LSS context remains in its early developmental stages, despite the pioneering efforts of scholars. The literature on AI and LSS demonstrates a limited effort to incorporate established theories. This study identifies four distinct knowledge clusters and presents five key propositions that offer valuable directions for future research. This study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive overview of AI's role in supporting the implementation of LSS practices. It proposes an AI-supported LSS dynamic capability framework, explaining how AI facilitates the sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring cycle within LSS. To bridge theory and practice, a decision matrix is presented, mapping AI to the DMAIC phases with illustrative industry examples."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of satellite constellations and the surge in real-time data downlink demand have forced Ground Stations (GSs) to process massive amounts of signals within very short time windows. For the demands of signal processing, real-time control, data exchange, and other functions, GSs typically adopt a heterogeneous processing unit architecture, with complex pipeline dependencies between the processing modules. When multiple task flows are accessed in parallel, efficiently implementing fine-grained resource mapping and scheduling becomes a core challenge in baseband signal processing. To address this issue, this paper proposes a real-time scheduling scheme for satellite task flows in the Heterogeneous Ground Baseband Resource Pool (HGBRP) to improve scheduling efficiency. We first construct a novel heterogeneous resource allocation and task flow real-time scheduling system, and introduce a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning with Graph Attention Networks (GAT-HDRL) to optimize scheduling. GAT is used to capture complex dependency relationships in satellite tasks modeled with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), while HDRL decomposes the scheduling process into layers to more effectively handle high-dimensional decision spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of GAT-HDRL under varying load pressures. The experimental results demonstrate that GAT-HDRL achieves the highest total actual profit across all instances when compared to multiple benchmark algorithms. In conclusion, this paper provides an effective solution for the efficient scheduling of real-time task flows in the HGBRP."

The results reveal that the upstream disk consistently exhibits higher heat transfer intensity than the downstream disk, with the Nusselt number distributions showing convex and concave radial profiles, respectively. Furthermore, the upstream disk is more sensitive to changes in the rotational Reynolds number, while the downstream disk shows stronger dependence on the axial Reynolds number.

This paper provides a systematic overview of the current applications of LLMs in marine robotics, discussing their capabilities, limitations, and potential directions for future research. The survey finds that while LLMs show promise across various applications in marine robotics, their deployment remains mostly confined to simulation.

To achieve maximum resource satisfaction with minimal resource cost and ensure resource allocation fairness, a multi-objective resource allocation model is established that combines minimizing the total resource allocation with maximizing user node resource satisfaction, subject to resource constraints. To address this problem, a GA-based strategy is introduced to manage available resource. This strategy incorporates a demand response priority mechanism for access network users and designs resource allocation ratios to ensure fair distribution of computational, transmission, and time resource. To address the local optimum trap in the GA, the DATLO is introduced to improve convergence speed and solution quality. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm, and a proof is provided based on the fixed point theorem. Furthermore, a fairness index is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed priority-driven GA-DATLO for different user scales, different user demand distributions, and different resource allocation types. This work provides a systematic approach to balancing efficiency and fairness in dynamic SIN environments."

While deep neural networks (DNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on time series benchmarks, their computational requirements and dependencies on extensive labeled datasets often make them impractical for real-time, on-device learning in dynamic settings that necessitate frequent retraining. To address this challenge, this paper adopts and optimizes hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for real-time MTS classification, benchmarking it against 14 state-of-the-art DNNs across 10 diverse MTS datasets under varying training data availability. Using automated hyperparameter tuning to jointly optimize the accuracy and training efficiency of each model, our framework consistently delivers comparable predictive performance with the best-performing DNNs, achieving a maximum drop of just $\\mathbf{- 2. 6 \\%}$ in accuracy and $\\mathbf{- 1. 5 \\%}$ in F1 score while offering a $28.9 \\times$ quicker training process on average than the fastest DNN in each data availability scenario. Our framework further exhibits greater robustness to low training data and efficiently scales as training size increases, overall positioning HDC as a practical and robust alternative over traditional deep learning approaches for real-time MTS classification."

Viewing the sequencing process as the read-phase of a DNA storage system, the information-theoretic capacity of noise-free shotgun sequencing has been characterized in literature. Motivated by the base-wise quality scores available in practical sequencers, a recent work considered the shotgun sequencing channel with erasures, in which the symbols in the reads are assumed to contain random erasures. Achievable rates for this channel were identified. In the present work, we obtain a converse for this channel. The arguments for the proof involve a careful analysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the reads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the achievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters."

Building on this, an event-triggered control protocol is developed: each UAV transmits state updates only when a rigorously derived triggering condition is satisfied, thereby minimizing unnecessary communication while precluding Zeno behavior. A unified Lyapunov-based analysis then establishes the boundedness and stability of all closed-loop signals. Finally, comprehensive numerical simulations validate the proposed control architecture, demonstrating its ability to maintain tight formation tracking despite limited transmission resources and external disturbances."

The method of adversarial robust knowledge distillation enables the transfer of defense capabilities from a high-capacity teacher network to an efficient student model which maintains segmentation accuracy and resource-limited deployment resilience. The integrated pipeline achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy ($84.20 \\%$) and segmentation robustness under various attack scenarios through empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks using convolutional and transformerbased segmentation architectures which outperform conventional baselines.

Using Abaqus, the residual stress and strain values in the Finocyl grain produced by the pressure curing process were simulated and calculated. The results indicate that the stress and strain in the propellant grain produced by pressure curing are significantly reduced, with the extent of reduction dependent on the applied pressure levels. The effectiveness of pressure curing process in reducing residual thermal stress-strain exhibits a distinct three-phase behavior with increasing pressure. The optimal reduction effectiveness is achieved at the optimum pressure level. The computational results in this study demonstrate that the pressure curing process is suitable for producing high-loading-ratio solid propellant grain. For the solid propellant grain and shell investigated in this study, the optimal pressure level ranges between 1.5-3.5 MPa. The pressure curing process achieves approximately 55% reduction in thermal stress and around 65% reduction in thermal strain within the propellant grain at its optimum effectiveness."

Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space—the space of generalized q-ary sequences ${\\mathbb{Z}_{{q_1}}} \\times {\\mathbb{Z}_{{q_2}}} \\times \\cdots \\times {\\mathbb{Z}_{{q_n}}}$ — where each ${\\mathbb{Z}_{{q_i}}}$ corresponds to integers modulo q<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the S-sparse Fourier transform of f with a sample complexity of O(Sn), computational complexity of O(SnlogN), and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N = \\prod\\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {{q_i}} \\to \\infty $ with S = N<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">δ</sup> for some 0 ≤ δ < 1.

Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized q-ary functions 8× faster using 16× fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to 13× fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as q-ary functions."

    "abstract": "To simplify the design of liquid oxygen and methane full-flow staged combustion cycle engines, an auto-ignition design scheme can be adopted to eliminate the need for igniters, thereby reducing structural weight and improving reliability. This requires determining the engine's auto-ignition limits in advance. This study provides quantitative indicators for auto-ignition limits using a zero-dimensional homogeneous reactor model. These indicators include the total inlet mass flow rate, the pure mixing temperatures of fuel-rich and oxygen-rich gases, and the combustion chamber throat area. It was found that increasing the inlet mass flow rate or pure mixing temperature, as well as reducing the throat area, can facilitate ignition. By combining detailed mechanism considerations with three-dimensional transient ignition numerical simulations, a general range for auto-ignition limits can be determined. In practical applications, actual operating conditions should ideally remain below the lower limit of this range to ensure smooth auto-ignition."

Key findings reveal: Both spoilers show increasing lateral forces and thrust losses with deflection angles, peaking at 32°. The rectangular spoiler provides 10-15% higher lateral force efficiency than the trapezoidal one at equal area.

Currently, allergy classification and diagnosis rely heavily on human expertise and standardized tests, which can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and subject to variability.

The research investigates the impact of varying the depth of the neural network, employing architectures with 2 to 5 hidden layers, to understand how the model’s complexity influences its performance. Using standard machine learning techniques, the model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of allergen IgE levels, and the results were assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in allergy detection, highlighting through that, the trade-offs between precision and recall in medical applications."

This research marks the first application of the PEA measurement technique on full-size High-Voltage-Direct-Current (HVDC) cables exceeding 100 meters in length, representing a significant advancement in cable testing methodologies. According to IEEE 1732, the maximum percent change in the electric field is evaluated at fixed three-hour intervals to determine when field stabilization occurs. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the acquired data is performed to assess the reliability and robustness of the measurements results. Temporal trends of electric field variations are analyzed, including statistical parameters such as mean values and standard deviations, over the acquisition intervals of the measurement. The findings reveal that spot measurements lack the statistical significance achieved through a more comprehensive approach to field behavior. Consequently, despite IEEE 1732 serves as a solid guideline, this study suggests a new approach for addressing data variability and measurement accuracy."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle control in low-friction environments should be capable of using all of the available traction at the road to accomplish maneuvering objectives. In these environments, however, the limit of traction is difficult to estimate, which challenges standard motion planning techniques. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory optimization framework that natively incorporates the complex and nonlinear effects of friction uncertainty into the planning process to improve both the performance and robustness of maneuvering at high accelerations. The core approach of the method is to explicitly consider a range of possible dynamics models, inclusive of their closed-loop behavior, simultaneously in the optimization. We illustrate this method through a racing example, where the minimum-time objective facilitates intuitive performance and robustness metrics (lap time and tracking error limits), all while necessitating vehicle maneuvering through nonlinear and friction-sensitive regions of the state space. Experiments on an autonomous VW Golf GTI on a challenging winter ice track demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.

    "abstract": "With the growing focus on carbon neutrality, integrated energy systems (IESs) have become vital for low-carbon transitions. However, conventional multi-IES planning remains energy-centric, overlooking inter- and intra-system interactions of carbon trading and carbon-based pricing. Therefore, this paper proposes a carbon-centric hybrid-game robust planning model for multi-IESs under higher-order uncertainties (HOUs). The proposed model integrates an inter-IES Nash bargaining game to enhance system-wide coordination with dynamic carbon trading, and an intra-IES Stackelberg game to improve supplier-user interaction via carbon-based energy pricing. A novel low-carbon flexible retrofitted CHP structure, alongside its extended carbon emission flow (ECEF) model, is developed to provide physical support for dynamic carbon attribution. Additionally, to address HOUs in renewable outputs, a confidence band-based ambiguity set is constructed, considering both parameter and distributional variations for system robust planning. A decomposition algorithm combining adaptive ADMM and parallel C&CG is implemented to ensure computational tractability. Finally, case studies on a real-world system in Southern China validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving emission reduction, operational flexibility, and planning robustness."

To address these challenges, a series of ionic ladder-like polysilsesquioxane (QLPSQ-X, X = Cl, FSI, BF4, or TFSI) were synthesized via quaternization followed by anion exchange. The rigid LPSQ framework ensures structural integrity, and its ionic groups enable efficient ion transport, yielding sensors with excellent linearity over 5%–97% RH. Specifically, the QLPSQ-TFSI sensor demonstrated the best linearity (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.99) and sensitivity (|log Ra/%RH| = 0.030) at 100 Hz, ultrafast response/recovery times (0.1 s/0.9 s at 5%–33% RH, 0.1/2.1 s at 5%–97% RH), low hysteresis (<12% RH), and stable operation (over 30 days).

However, inaccurate step counting is often caused by false positives during non-walking wrist movements, potentially leading to incorrect health assessments, ineffective interventions, and suboptimal patient outcomes. We thus propose a real-time adaptive multi-stage step counting algorithm based on a smartwatch 3-axis accelerometer, integrating non-walking detection to identify false positive step counts during non-walking wrist movements. Sixty-seven subjects wore a smartwatch with a 3-axis accelerometer and performed walking and running trials and eight non-gait trials: eating with forks and chopsticks, drinking, rolling while sleeping, flipping the wrist to check a watch, moving and grasping objects, typing, and using a computer mouse. When evaluated on the proprietary dataset, the proposed model was 93.58% accurate in estimating step counts as compared with 10.09% accuracy from a standard peak detection framework that grossly over-counted steps during non-walking movements. In non-walking detection experiments, the proposed model was almost more accurate and efficient than other four baseline models (p < 0.05), while requiring only 8.9% of the inference time of a single OCSVM. These results highlight the importance of rejecting false positive step counts during non-walking movements from wrist-worn step counters, and our proposed approach holds potential to more accurately estimate step counting in real-life scenarios to improve aerobic exercise assessment and promote sedentary disease prevention."

Novel graph-theoretical methods for topology derivation and control design are introduced as one of the promising systematic solutions for future innovations. Key research opportunities include robust control solutions, reliability enhancement, advanced semiconductor integration, and refined magnetic design.

However, as every coin has two sides, IoE having such a huge and complex network is more vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. Although the traditional signal-domain anti-jamming methods have guaranteed IoE security to a certain extent, they have touched the performance ceiling since they passively adapt to unknown jamming attacks within limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) of signal waveform. Therefore, we delve into reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted endogenous anti-jamming communications (EAJC) in IoE, which harnesses RIS to explore dynamic, heterogeneous, and redundant (DHR) endogenous attributes of channels (e.g., uniqueness and heterogeneity), thus enabling IoE anti-jamming from passive defense to active immunity with abundant channel-domain DoFs. We begin by detailing the fundamental mechanism of EAJC, along with three promising EAJC approaches. Subsequently, we develop some novel concepts of RIS architecture to achieve EAJC in IoE, whose comprehensive principles, frameworks and benefits underpinning RIS-assisted EAJC are provided. We then outline the key challenges and potential solutions to the operation of RIS-assisted EAJC in IoE. Lastly, we give a case study to demonstrate the superiority of RIS-EAJC in IoE."

    "abstract": "Serverless Edge Computing (SEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for delivering low-latency, resource-efficient services for edge-native applications, which are implemented as dependent functions, forming Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) workflows. Unfortunately, the application's performance is hindered by the notorious issue of cold startup, especially in resource-constrained SEC environments. Layer- wise container caching has been proven to be an effective startup acceleration solution in SEC, due to its fine granularity and flexibility. However, due to the dynamic nature of call graphs and the skewness in function popularity in DAG workflows, as well as the heterogeneity of container layer cold start time and edge computing environments, the performance of existing layer- wise caching mechanisms degrades significantly. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient DAG workflow deployment method in SEC to minimize the application completion time (ACT) in the long term. We model the problem as a joint optimization of container layer- wise caching and function scheduling, which is a Time-coupled Integer Nonlinear Programming (TINLP) problem. To solve it, we first convert it to an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and propose an online algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees.

    "abstract": "With global population growth, sustainable agriculture requires efficient soil moisture sensing for precise irrigation. While commercial soil moisture sensors are often limited by cost and durability, state-of-the-art RF-based sensing solutions require additional signal transmitter infrastructure, hindering widespread adoption. To fill this gap, we introduce GPSoil—a novel soil moisture sensing system that leverages pervasive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals. On the hardware side, we employ two antennas along with a low-cost RF switch, enabling error mitigation for long propagation distances by comparing the signals captured from both antennas. On the software side, we leverage the inherent clock drift errors in commercial GNSS sensors and turn them into tools for fine-grained value extraction, enabling high-resolution sensing from otherwise coarse data. By integrating hardware and software innovations, we successfully achieve practical soil moisture sensing using GNSS signals. Built with off-the-shelf components, GPSoil achieves a soil moisture accuracy of 5.2% at a material cost of only $10.56, making it far more affordable than existing systems. GPSoil can sense moisture up to one meter underground, far surpassing other RF-based sensing systems and meeting the needs of most crops and irrigation systems. This work pioneers the use of GNSS signals in agriculture, offering a scalable, low-cost solution for advancing precision irrigation and promoting sustainable agriculture."

One problem for traceroute analysis is that certain types of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) tunnels hide routers from traceroute output. Worse still, there is no simple way to detect or reveal missing routers. Any analysis that expects comprehensive topology discovery—including identifying performance bottlenecks, analyzing traffic engineering approaches, and evaluating traffic sovereignty—needs to account for MPLS. In this paper, we replicate previous work by Vanaubel et al. [18, 21] to characterize and provide a snapshot of the current deployment of MPLS tunnels. We also release a sustainable and easily deployed tool for MPLS detection, called PyTNT. Using PyTNT, we find that the problematic types of MPLS tunnels remain prevalent, though we inferred a general decrease in MPLS usage across the Internet. We also inferred that public clouds accounted for 3 of the top 10 networks with the most routers observed to be in MPLS tunnels. Finally, we observed more MPLS routers in Europe than any in other continent, and more MPLS routers in the U.S. than any other country."

While previous research has studied such performance, the focus has primarily been on the wired Internet, pointing to Wi-Fi as a bottleneck without investigating the reasons thereof. We believe that the preliminary results presented in this paper, from in-depth studies of residential Wi-Fi deployments in a small Midwestern town, offer a first look into how the Wi-Fi environment may impact the user experience. Over a period of six months, we deployed single-board computers to measure the throughput and latency of Wi-Fi and the backhaul broadband network in a number of different residential environments, as well as capture the Wi-Fi signal environment. Our analyses show: (i) interoperability issues between AP and client supporting different Wi-Fi amendments (e.g., 802.11ac, 802.11ax); (ii) a lack of smart interference management and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) support, resulting in over-usage of channels in the U-NII-1 and U-NII-3 bands when other, less congested bands may be available."

Different fingerprinting actors make use of distinct canvases for this purpose and thus, as we show, it is possible to ''fingerprint the fingerprinters'' by grouping together identical canvases that are employed for these tests. In this paper, we document the prevalence of canvas fingerprinting (finding that 12.7% of the top 20K sites engage in it), use this grouping technique to measure and characterize the online footprint of widely-used fingerprinting services, and finally analyze the context in which these services are used to shine light on their intended purpose."

First, the airgap magnetic field (AMF) characteristics of the SPMAFM are analyzed to propose the installation method of the two sets of three-phase LHSs. Then, the decoding algorithm based on the orthogonal third harmonics is presented. Meanwhile, under no-load and load conditions, the position detection accuracy of the proposed method at different speeds is calculated and compared with two previous methods. The results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates higher prediction accuracy across the entire speed range. Finally, a prototype of the SPMAFM with the two sets of three-phase LHSs installed was manufactured and tested under both steady-state and dynamic conditions to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and simulation results."

By extending the analysis to photon-energy-dependent illumination, interface-related defect states in the STD device were identified within the 1.31.5 eV range. Complementary reliability tests, including positive bias stress (PBS), negative bias stress (NBS), and hot carrier stress (HCS), further confirmed the superior stability of the Si-free BGI. The results confirm the improved performance of the Si-free BGI. Overall, this study underscores illumination behavior as an indicator of interfacial defects in OTFTs, thereby advancing the understanding of defect-related degradation mechanisms."

    "abstract": "High-precision measurement of large-tilt-angle surfaces in industrial inspection has long been a challenge in the field of optical metrology, with traditional methods often struggling to achieve ideal detection results under such conditions. Based on spectral confocal theory, a novel chromatic line confocal imaging measurement system is designed and implemented. By integrating customized optical design and chromatic encoding technology, diffuse reflection signals from the sample surface effectively compensate for measurement blind spots caused by the dependence of conventional line confocal imaging systems on specular reflection. Owing to the more uniform angular distribution characteristics of diffuse reflection, this system significantly enhances information acquisition capability for large tilt surfaces, effectively accommodating complex optical scenarios involving substantial variations in surface reflectivity and roughness. Experimental validations demonstrate that the system maintains stable and accurate confocal spectral signal acquisition even at sample surface inclination angles up to 77.615°. In measurements of erosion pits, the measurement uncertainty does not exceed 0.25 μm. Moreover, during measurements of complex components, the system exhibits excellent detection performance, offering a feasible technological solution for high-precision, three-dimensional measurement of complex parts with large tilt angles in industrial online inspection applications."

    "abstract": "Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) extends the concept of single-layer reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) by incorporating a multi-layered structure, thereby providing enhanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation and improved signal processing capabilities. This study investigates the potential of SIM in enhancing the rate fairness in multiuser downlink systems by addressing two key optimization problems: maximizing the minimum rate (MR) and maximizing the geometric mean of rates (GMR). The former strives to enhance the minimum user rate, thereby ensuring fairness among users, while the latter relaxes fairness requirements to strike a better trade-off between user fairness and system sum-rate (SR). For the MR maximization, we adopt a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based approach, which decomposes the approximated problem into sub-problems with closed-form solutions. For GMR maximization, we develop an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that also yields closed-form solutions and can be seamlessly adapted for SR maximization. Numerical results validate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed algorithms. Comparative evaluations show that MR maximization ensures near-perfect fairness, while GMR maximization balances fairness and system SR. Furthermore, the two proposed algorithms respectively outperform existing related works in terms of MR and SR performance. Lastly, SIM with lower power consumption achieves performance comparable to that of multi-antenna digital beamforming."

At present, there are several typical core shapes being widely adopted considering the manufacturing process. However, the influences of the various core shapes on the optimal design and performance improvement of HFTs are still a challenge. This study investigates the loss and temperature distribution characteristics of the HFTs with three typical nanocrystalline core shapes. The 20-kVA HFTs with U-shaped, U-shell and triangular cores are designed, and then the transient coupling magnetic-thermal model is established for the loss and thermal analysis under different load conditions. The HFT prototypes with these core shapes are manufactured and experimental validation are also carried out. The results show that the HFT prototype with triangular core has the maximum core loss under the no-load condition, but the copper loss of the HFT with U-shaped core is slightly greater than those of the other two HFT prototypes under the short-circuit condition. As for the temperature distribution, under the full-load condition, the highest temperatures on the surfaces of the prototypes with U-shaped, U-shell and triangular cores are 108.0°C, 135.4°C and 106.5°C, respectively. Moreover, the maximum temperature differences on the surfaces of the three HFTs are approximately 55°C, 85°C and 30°C, respectively."

Yet, we find that this progress does not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for interpreting charts. We introduce ENCQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. ENCQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size."

Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing."

However, the interaction with the environment could be unpredictable, which requires the robots to be equipped with the ability of environment perception. This article presents a junction tensegrity robot (JTBot), which consists of both flexible and rigid struts, for the inspection of unstructured pipelines. Slender elastic beams are utilized to replace the rigid rods to enhance the robot’s dexterity and flexibility by generating large-scale deformations. Compact deflection sensors are embedded onto the flexible struts to enable the JTBot with the capability to estimate its equilibrium state and to predict the contact conditions with the environment. A closed-form model of the robot’s kinetostatics is established to characterize the interaction behavior of such a cable-constrained flexible mechanism efficiently. Hence, in situ gait optimization can be implemented for the crawling robot with the aid of the intrinsic environmental perception. A prototype of the JTBot is developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design, on which a variety of validation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the developed JTBot is able to pass through complex pipelines in a dexterous way. In addition, a demonstration is provided to illustrate the JTBot’s capability of defect detection in unstructured pipelines."

In addition, unlike X -band wave radar systems, no Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) has yet been estimated for SRK-band radars. In this contribution, we propose a preliminary empirical linear MTF derived through a numerical analysis. The present study represents the first step towards the development of an MTF tailored to SRK-band systems and adaptable to varying sea states and environmental conditions."

    "abstract": "Traditional bathymetric survey methods, such as single-beam and multibeam echo sounding or bathymetric LiDAR, while highly accurate, are often costly and challenging to implement in shallow or inaccessible areas. This study presents a cost-effective approach for estimating shallow-water bathymetry using only RGB imagery acquired with a UAVmounted camera. The proposed methodology employs the Random Forest regression algorithm to model the relationship between selected spectral and water depth. All input features were derived exclusively from the RGB orthophoto, eliminating the need for multispectral imagery. Validation results indicate that the Random Forest model performed very well in predicting water depth. The coefficient of determination $\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}\\right)$ reached $\\mathbf{0 . 7 9 5}$, indicating that approximately $92 \\%$ of the variance in observed depth values was explained by the model. Furthermore, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was $\\mathbf{0 . 1 5 9 ~ m}$, demonstrating a relatively low level of prediction error. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the selected spectral indices and the applied machine learning approach for shallow-water bathymetry estimation. Based on the analysis, it was concluded that a simplified version of the model could potentially be developed using only the Log RB and RG ratio indices, as they showed the highest predictive importance."

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in IoT (Internet of Things) devices in 5 G networks poses an increasing challenge for managing uplink (UL) traffic, especially in dense and heterogeneous scenarios. Traditional uplink management strategies may not achieve fairness or efficiency in resource allocation under realistic, dynamic conditions related to IoT traffic. This paper provides a procedural framework for Downlink and Uplink Decoupling (DUDe) which produces performance benefits for the uplink in 5G networks leveraging IoT devices. The framework is examined via simulation in MATLAB in a variety of scenarios and the performance of DUDe is compared with existing uplink management strategies in the literature. The results presented demonstrate that DUDe achieves substantial gains in fairness with regard to resource allocation, with minimal deterioration in spectral efficiency, and moderate impact on throughput. Finally, operational challenges related to deploying DUDe in practice (e.g. hardware compatibility and operational complexity) are considered, along with potential solutions. The paper can be seen as an informative reference for future potential practical implementation of DUDe in real world 5G IoT networks."

Taking the hypersonic variable-configuration vehicle of the wing-body combination based on the fuselage of waverider as the research object, the aero-thermo-structural multi-physics coupling numerical simulation study was carried out by using the CFD/CSD method. The structural field and flow field characteristics of hypersonic wing-body combination variable-configuration aircraft were analyzed for four variable-configuration schemes. The influence of variations in angle of attack, Mach number, and altitude on the external flow distribution and the structural temperature, stress, and deformation was studied. The results showed that the variable-configuration scheme could improve the aerodynamic parameters of the aircraft effectively, and there were corresponding configurations with the optimal lift-to-drag ratio under different flight conditions; In the analysis of structural stress and deformation, it was found that the stress concentration phenomenon occurred at the leading edge of the junction of the inboard and outboard wing, and the maximum deformation occurred at the trailing edge of the wing tip of the outboard wing; During the flight of the aircraft, the increase in the angle of attack caused the transition point of the wing structure to move forward, resulting in more severe aerodynamic heating on the windward side of the wing compared to the leeward side."

It is found that the combustion instability in single chamber dual thrust solid rocket motors arises due to changes in grain geometry and propellant burning rate.

By leveraging an ensemble of teacher models trained on sensitive data to annotate unlabeled public data for a student model, PATE introduces differential privacy through noise injection during the aggregation process. However, a significant vulnerability persists: the individual predictions made by teacher models on public queries may still reveal private information. To address this shortcoming, we propose SecPATE — a novel enhancement of the PATE framework that incorporates Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) for privacy-preserving aggregation. Sec-PATE enables teacher models to collaboratively compute the final aggregated label within a secure SMC protocol, without disclosing any individual predictions or intermediate data. This integration ensures that sensitive insights from the teachers’ private datasets remain confidential, even during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SecPATE not only fortifies the privacy guarantees of the original PATE framework but also preserves its utility and predictive performance, offering a practical path forward for secure and trustworthy machine learning."

    "abstract": "Surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have emerged as a promising approach to solving expensive constrained multi-objective optimisation problems (ECMOPs) by significantly reducing computational costs. However, existing SAEAs typically rely on fixed surrogate modelling strategies or manually predefined switching mechanisms, which limits their adaptability and effectiveness across diverse optimisation scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a double Q-learning-based surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm, denoted as QSAEA, to solve expensive constrained multi-objective optimisation problems (ECMOPs). The algorithm combines three surrogate modelling strategies and adopts the double Q-learning mechanism for adaptive selection. The first strategy models only approximate the objectives, helping the population traverses across infeasible regions and approach the unconstrained Pareto front (UPF) quickly. The second strategy considers both objectives and constraint violation (CV), guiding the population moves towards the feasible region while preserving solution quality. The third strategy incorporates objectives and each unsatisfied constraint to perform local search within the feasible region, improving convergence accuracy and solution diversity. The double Q-learning mechanism takes the Pearson correlation between the contributions of individuals with respect to objective improvement and constraint violation as the state input. This allows the algorithm to dynamically choose the most suitable modelling strategy at each stage and adapt to the changing search landscape. Experimental results on a series of benchmark test suites and five real-world mechanical design problems demonstrate the effectiveness of QSAEA in solving ECMOP."

To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">direct queries</i>, which consists in the computation of view assessment indices, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">inverse queries</i>, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns.

Although recent studies have examined how text elements (e.g., titles and annotations) influence comprehension, preferences, and predictions, many questions remain about textual design and use in practice. This paper introduces a framework for understanding text functions in information visualizations, building on and filling gaps in prior classifications and taxonomies. Through an analysis of 120 real-world visualizations and 804 text elements, we identified ten distinct text functions, ranging from identifying data mappings to presenting valenced subtext. We further identify patterns in text usage and conduct a factor analysis, revealing four overarching text-informed design strategies: Attribution and Variables, Annotation-Centric Design, Visual Embellishments, and Narrative Framing. In addition to these factors, we explore features of title rhetoric and text multifunctionality, while also uncovering previously unexamined text functions, such as text replacing visual elements. Our findings highlight the flexibility of text, demonstrating how different text elements in a given design can combine to communicate, synthesize, and frame visual information. This framework adds important nuance and detail to existing frameworks that analyze the diverse roles of text in visualization."

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm for time-varying volumetric data compression and representation, owing to their ability to model high-dimensional signals effectively. INRs represent scalar fields based on sampled coordinates, typically using either a single network for the entire field or multiple networks across different spatial domains. However, these approaches often face challenges in modeling complex patterns and introducing boundary artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-INR,an INR architecture based on a mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. MoE-INR automates irregular subdivisions of spatiotemporal fields and dynamically assigns them to different expert networks. The architecture comprises three key components: a policy network, a shared encoder, and multiple expert decoders. The policy network subdivides the field and determines which expert decoder is responsible for a given input coordinate. The shared encoder extracts hidden representations from the input coordinates, and the expert decoders transform these high-dimensional features into scalar values. This design results in a unified framework accommodating diverse INR types, including conventional, grid-based, and ensemble. We evaluate the effectiveness of MoE-INR on multiple time-varying datasets with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-INR significantly outperforms existing non-MoE and MoE-based INRs and traditional lossy compression methods across quantitative and qualitative metrics under various compression ratios."

In this approach, RewardRRT conceptualizes the sampling tree of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) as an agent, assigning a reward value function to each sampled state. Simultaneously, the cumulative reward and reward increment are utilized as the state space, with a linear Kalman Filter applied to predict the state transitions. To enhance convergence speed, a bidirectional expansion strategy is implemented, wherein the tree with the lower cumulative reward prediction is prioritized for iteration. Here, the sampling bias is regulated using a sigmoid function and the prediction value. Finally, simulation tests in 4 distinct point cloud scenarios and a real experiment are conducted using a self-designed 21-degree-of-freedom wheeled humanoid robot. Compared to the best-performing algorithm from the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) in the same scenarios, RewardRRT achieves improvements in speed by 38.45%, 8.18%, 9.88%, and 14.98%, respectively. Furthermore, RewardRRT exhibits an average planning success rate of 88.25%, surpassing OMPL's best-performing algorithm by 29.75%.

This paper develops a set-based formulation to identify vulnerable Volt–VAR curve coordinates of distributed energy resources (DERs) within IEEE 1547–compliant design rules. We construct adversarial models under two challenging scenarios: (i) uncertain, low-confidence samples near class decision boundaries and (ii) decision-based adversarial attacks generated with the HopSkipJump algorithm. The resulting perturbations reveal a broad attack surface across multiple curve breakpoints, where minimal coordinate edits can induce substantial voltage violations while remaining statistically subtle. To detect such attacks, we design a ResNet-based classification framework with feature-level explanations. Evaluations on a realistic 5,625-node distribution feeder show that the proposed detector attains 96.67% accuracy on adversarial samples and that the explainable model consistently highlights the most impacted Volt–VAR features, enabling targeted mitigation of vulnerable curve coordinates."

    "abstract": "Emotional states play a crucial yet often overlooked role in mastering a new language—our research sheds light on this dynamic, moving past conventional models that focus solely on cognitive processes. We introduce Affect-LinguoNet, a hybrid neural-symbolic framework explicitly designed to incorporate affective dynamics into the language learning process. This model seamlessly integrates a linguistic encoder, an emotional encoder, and a joint state projection mechanism, enabling it to capture both linguistic competence and evolving emotional profiles. Through a novel cross-modal modulation, Affect-LinguoNet not only predicts but also simulates how emotions like anxiety or enjoyment dynamically influence cognitive transitions and task competence. Building on this, we develop Emotion-Guided Adaptive Sequencing (EGAS), a strategic pedagogical layer that frames language instruction as a partially observable Markov decision process. EGAS optimizes both linguistic gains and emotional regulation by employing a dual-objective reward function that balances competence improvements with minimization of affective distress. It maintains a belief distribution over learners’ latent emotional-cognitive states and adapts instructional pacing, complexity, and feedback using emotion-tuned exploration and meta-adaptation loops. This holistic approach ensures emotionally viable learning trajectories by dynamically aligning content sequencing with the learner’s affective tolerance. Experimental evaluations on real-world second language learner datasets (L2-ARCTIC and CALL-SLT) demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves learning task performance and emotional self-regulation. The framework achieves a 17% increase in learner engagement and a 12% improvement in task accuracy compared to baseline models lacking emotion-awareness. By embedding emotional intelligence directly into both the learner model and instructional strategy, this work establishes a robust foundation for affect-aware, human-centered language education. Future research will extend scalability across proficiency levels and further enrich emotional inference through deeper contextual modeling."

This paper addresses the deployment problem for anchors on the detector and tags on an object, leveraging range measurements for high accuracy. We designed a Reference Point Transformation (RPT) joint deployment algorithm, including a topology framework of deployment, a joint deployment model, and the RPT module in 6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DoF). First, the topology framework of deployment decreases the search space of the optimization problem. Second, the joint deployment model represents anchors and tags together mathematically, allowing the deployment problem to be treated in a unified framework. The final component of our framework aims to determine an optimal anchor/tag configuration at a designated target point. Specifically, using the translation and rotation between the reference and target points, the optimization criterion shifts from the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) at the reference point to the square root of the trace of the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the target point position. Thereafter, simulations and experiments were conducted to demonstrate the rationality of the RPT deployment algorithm compared with three other deployment algorithms. The good performance of the RPT deployment algorithm verifies that it is suitable for 6-DoF Rigid Body Localization (RBL). Finally, the extended performance analysis of the RPT deployment algorithm is conducted to illustrate two relationships related to the lower bound of localization errors. One is the detector dimensions under the topology framework. The other is the number of anchors and tags under the RPT deployment algorithm."

Task offloading is the typical collaboration form for UAV system. However, it still be a challenging problem for UAV system due to task dependencies and the UAV mobility which makes the traditional offloading approaches inefficiency. In this paper, we model the offloading problem as the Sequential Task Offloading Problem (sTOP), which takes the task spatiotemporal dependencies into account. We propose a Graph-based Spatiotemporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) framework, where the environment is modeled as a heterogeneous graph to capture the diverse relationships among system entities. A spatiotemporal state extraction module is designed, which integrates a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) for spatial dependency modeling and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for temporal dynamics. Based on the extracted representations, a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (mPPO) algorithm is proposed to make valid and efficient offloading decisions under multiple system constraints. Extensive experiments using real UAV trajectory and building distribution datasets validate that the proposed method improves the average reward by approximately 25% over state-of-the-art DRL-based and heuristic baselines, by increasing task success rate and operational effectiveness ratio (OER) to 30–50%, while reducing execution time by up to 40% in complex multi-UAV systems."

    "abstract": "The rapid deployment of advanced metering infrastructure facilitates the development of data-driven attack detection methods in smart grids, which typically rely on large amounts of labeled data for training. However, when new types of attacks or faults emerge, security analysts may only intercept limited malicious samples. The scarcity of samples makes it difficult for data-driven methods to learn effective decision boundaries, leading to degraded detection performance. In this work, we bridge the gap by learning class prototype representations from limited samples and learning to match unlabeled samples with corresponding prototypes. Specifically, we propose a meta-learning-based framework termed Learning to Match Prototype (L2MP), which consists of a prototypical network (ProtoNet) that learns prototype representations by aggregating features from labeled samples, and a matching network that assesses the matching degree between unlabeled samples and prototypes for classification. Through episodic training designed to simulate the few-shot setting, L2MP learns to adapt to novel attack and fault types with only a few samples per class. Moreover, we utilize a bilevel optimization strategy to ensure efficient training of both networks. Extensive case studies on smart grid datasets demonstrate that L2MP achieves robust performance under harsh learning conditions and has practical utility in real-world scenarios."

Moreover, VI-Planning employs a novel bitwise encoding mechanism to efficiently compress these maps, enabling practical transmission. The experimental results demonstrate that VI-Planning can achieve real-time planning optimization with extremely low bandwidth consumption, significantly enhancing the driving safety of autonomous systems. The source code and video demonstration of VI-Planning are available on GitHub: https://github.com/YANG-Deep/VI-Planning."

Satellite IoTs enable novel Direct-to-Satellite (DtS) connectivity, allowing IoT devices in remote areas to connect to the Internet via LEO satellites using existing terrestrial technologies like LoRa. This paper presents the first-of-its-kind measurement study on satellite IoTs, investigating the practical characteristics of DtS communications and their suitability for IoT applications. We deployed 27 low-cost ground stations across eight locations worldwide to passively measure the network availability of multiple constellations. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the effective durations of DtS connectivity and their theoretical durations, leading to intermittent connections for satellite IoTs. Additionally, we examine the performance of the Tianqi constellation in supporting real-world IoT traffic (agriculture application). We observed longer delays and higher power consumption in satellite IoTs compared to terrestrial IoTs. Our study identifies the bottlenecks and sheds light on potential optimizations for satellite IoTs."

Applications rely on these RPC providers to be performant (announce new blocks timely) and reliable (no missing blocks/transactions) to provide good user experience and security guarantees. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale, longitudinal study to evaluate the timeliness and trustworthiness of 16 RPC providers for BNB Smart Chain (BSC) across 6 223 blocks and 123 773 transactions. We identify significant variability: some providers are inconsistent, miss valid blocks/transactions, or are seconds slower than others. Our findings suggest that the implicit trust assumptions are often violated, which may leave users confused and even vulnerable to attacks."

To address individual tissue variability and optimize the passive metasurface design, we develop a tunable metasurface and a one-shot calibration method to obtain the impedance for optimal resonance in glucose sensing environments with unknown parameters. The calibrated impedance is then used for the inverse design and fabrication of an economical passive metasurface. We implement prototypes of CGMM and conduct extensive experimental evaluations. In human experiments involving ten participants using the prototype with LibreVNA, the overall performance is quantified with relative errors ranging from -5.02% to 6.93% and an RMSE of 9.65 mg/dL."

To address this, we present UrgenGo, a non-intrusive, urgency-aware GPU scheduling system that operates without access to application source code. UrgenGo implicitly prioritizes GPU executions through transparent kernel launch manipulation, employing task-level stream binding, delayed kernel launching, and batched kernel launch synchronization. We conducted extensive real-world evaluations in collaboration with a self-driving startup, developing 11 GPU-bound task chains for a realistic autonomous navigation application and implementing our system on a self-driving bus. Our results show a significant 61% reduction in the overall deadline miss ratio, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU scheduler that requires source code modifications."

The users communicate with each other assisted by the BS to decode their required files. M. Abolpour et al. proposed an MIR coded caching scheme (referred to as the ASMST scheme), where the uplink/downlink normalized delivery time (NDT) achieves the information-theoretic lower bound for the multiple-input multiple-output (MISO) coded caching system under uncoded cache placement and one-shot linear delivery. However, its subpacketization and computational complexity are extremely high. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive that the condition for the uplink/downlink strategy is exactly that for a multi-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA) with the optimal sum Degree-Of-Freedom (sum-DoF). Based on existing MAPDAs, we proposed three new MIR coded caching schemes, which significantly reduce both the subpacketization and computational complexity while maintaining the same uplink/downlink NDT as the ASMST scheme."

    "abstract": "Sea level rise (SLR) is a global and progressive phenomenon that risks having adverse consequences on large coastal areas of the Earth. Caused mainly by the thermal expansion of sea water related to global warming and the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, sea level rise is a significant aspect of climate change and can lead to consequences such as coastal flooding, erosion, saltwater intrusion and increased vulnerability of coastal zones. Italy, with its extensive coastline and low-lying coastal areas, is particularly at risk of the impacts of SLR, with potentially severe consequences for coastal cities and economic activity. Among the potentially most exposed coastal plains there is certainly the Domitian zone (Campania Region) due to the particular morphological condition characterized by a low and sandy coast followed by large flat areas. The availability of forecast data, such as those of the Copernicus databases, which identify future scenarios of SLR and the presence of versatile tools such as GIS (Geographic Information System) software make it possible and easy to map the areas at risk of flooding in the coming years. This article presents the results of a preliminary study carried out on the northern coastal strip of Campania, precisely the one delimited by the Domitian coast. For a first estimate of the potentially floodable areas in relation to different forecast scenarios represented by the Copernicus data, digital elevation models (DEMs) with a resolution of 20 m and $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ m}$ are used, highlighting how the different level of detail of the altimetric information affects the mapping of the flooded zones and, therefore, the calculation of the areas at risk. Data for eight different scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100, each characterized by a different magnitude of the SLR phenomenon, are considered. All processing is carried out using Quantum GIS (QGIS) software, version 3.28. The experiments conducted highlight both the extreme vulnerability of the area under consideration due to its morphology (it lies within the broad Campanian plain that extends for many kilometers from the coast) and the strong variability of the results in relation to the geometric resolution of the DEM used."

Athena++ is a well-established astrophysical code that employs advanced Riemann solvers to simulate fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In our work, we analyze the solver execution flow to identify performance bottlenecks and redesign critical components to leverage GPU parallelism effectively. Key strategies include selective input array transfer to minimize memory overhead, CPU-side preprocessing of external functions, and loop-level parallelization within CUDA kernels. In particular, the HLLD solver was optimized through asynchronous kernel execution and decoupling of CPU-exclusive logic. Experimental results conducted in the Google Colab environment using NVIDIA GPUs showed a $\\sim 25 \\times$ improvement in average time per cycle, with an overall runtime reduction of approximately $20 \\%$. Some performance degradation in total cycle count ($\\sim 12.6 \\%$) was observed due to numerical variations introduced during kernel migration. Nonetheless, the proposed GPU-enabled approach demonstrates notable scalability and performance benefits, particularly for large-scale MHD problems. This work offers a practical and reusable framework for integrating GPU acceleration into existing solver-based codes, supporting the broader goals of heterogeneous computing in HPC-AI systems."

By simulating and modeling the visibility of typical Earth orbit artificial satellites, the study provides celestial autonomous positioning algorithms under different boundary conditions based on the number of observable satellites. The simulation models and algorithms were validated through ground-based star observation experiments. Results show that when the incident zenith angle is within 85°, LEO (low-Earth orbit) satellites have an equivalent magnitude better than 5th magnitude stars, which can be detected by star sensor. Within approximately 10 seconds of continuous tracking of Starlink satellites, the algorithm can achieve autonomous positioning. High-precision navigation and positioning can be realized when the ephemeris accuracy is guaranteed."

Quantum mechanics enables the calculation of probabilities for experimental outcomes, emphasizing statistical averages rather than detailed descriptions of individual events. This makes empirical coordination a natural and operationally meaningful framework for quantum systems, particularly in the context of nonlocal games, which rely on repeated measurements to assess performance. We discuss how coordination performance provides new insights into the implementation and simulation of quantum nonlocal games in the empirical regime.We begin by analyzing networks with classical links, focusing on the cascade network. We establish the optimal coordination rates, which indicate the minimal resources required to simulate a quantum state on average. We then consider networks with quantum links, focusing on a broadcast setting where a single transmitter distributes entanglement between multiple receivers. Our capacity result determines the necessary and sufficient resources required for preparing correlations that can subsequently be used in quantum nonlocal games."

We propose a scheme satisfying both conditions and derive a lower bound based on cut-set arguments. Also, we prove that our scheme is optimal when r ≥ C − 1, and it is order-optimal when the cache memory size M is greater than or equal to a certain threshold for r < C − 1. When r = 1, in most of the memory region, our scheme achieves the same rate as the one given by the secretive scheme for the dedicated cache setup by Ravindrakumar et al.

The framework dynamically selects low-level routing and allocation heuristics based on current edge node states, such as local demand surges, node failures, and communication delays. Unlike conventional centralized supply chain models, our approach enables distributed hubs (edge devices or local logistics centers) to autonomously optimize last-mile delivery operations while maintaining global coordination through lightweight reward sharing. The model is implemented in a simulated edge logistics testbed with dynamic constraints and evaluated against baseline metaheuristics and federated learning approaches. Results show significant improvements in decision latency, resource utilization, and system resilience. The proposed method demonstrates how hyper-heuristics, when integrated with edge intelligence and reinforcement learning, can empower real-time, adaptive logistics in smart cities and critical infrastructure systems."

Numerical simulations of flow separation in both cold-flow subscale and hot-gas full-scale nozzles demonstrate that the modified model significantly improves prediction accuracy across multiple operating conditions compared to the original model, showing good agreement with experimental data.

To rigorously evaluate the dynamic behavior of these platforms, a specialized X-shaped floating structure was analyzed. The study employed advanced computational methodologies, leveraging Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model complex wave-structure interactions and Mooring Dynamics principles to simulate the forces within different tethered configurations. A comprehensive analysis was performed on the structure's motion response (including heave, pitch, and roll) when subjected to regular wave trains characterized by varying Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) numbers. This systematic variation in KC number allowed for the assessment of wave loading effects across different flow regimes relevant to practical marine conditions. Furthermore, the research undertook a detailed comparative evaluation of several distinct mooring configurations, critically examining their respective advantages (such as stability enhancement, minimal footprint, or cost-effectiveness) and disadvantages (like susceptibility to dynamic snap loads, complex installation, or limited positioning control) under the investigated wave exposures. The insights derived from both the motion response analysis and the mooring system comparison establish a robust theoretical foundation essential for addressing critical mooring challenges anticipated in future maritime-prepositioned, cross-medium quadrotor UAVs. This work directly contributes to enhancing the operational reliability and survivability of such innovative platforms during sustained sea-surface operations or transitional phases in demanding marine environments."

A deep learning-based image recognition software has been trained on a dataset of images of surfaces acquired during field testing, where fouling levels were annotated by expert operators. The developed software performs image segmentation, classifying each pixel into one of three categories: clear surface, hard fouling, and soft fouling. Unlike most approaches in the literature-which rely on randomly annotated points-this method provides fullimage segmentation, offering a more comprehensive assessment of biofouling distribution. Results indicate that the predicted segmentation masks closely match the ground truth for the clear and soft fouling classes. However, an underestimation was observed for the hard fouling class, likely due to its underrepresentation in the training dataset. Future development will focus on improving dataset balance and model performance. The machine learning model is planned to be integrated into a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), enabling real-time, in-water biofouling assessment in accordance with the latest IMO guidelines."

Outlier detection was performed using multiple strategies, tailored for each pollutant according to its nature and value range. Results show significant variance reduction and improved data consistency, enabling better downstream machine learning modeling. The preprocessing approach demonstrated here can be generalized to similar urban air quality datasets, highlighting its effectiveness for environmental monitoring and prediction, calling for a more sustainable way of living that supports smart cities management."

By 2030, quantum computers, along with Shor’s algorithm, could break RSA and ECC, endangering global cybersecurity. As a countermeasure, the National Security Agency added CRYSTALS-Kyber, a quantum-safe key encapsulation mechanism, to the Commercial National Algorithm Suite 2.0. However, CRYSTALS-Kyber is vulnerable to cache side-channel attacks (SCAs) that can obtain the secret key and decrypt sensitive data. This research investigates the feasibility of cache SCAs against CRYSTALS-Kyber in a cloud environment, and proposes the mitigation strategy of Single-Point Pseudo-Random Cache Flushing to strengthen the decapsulation function of CRYSTALS-Kyber against cache SCAs. Prior to implementing Single-Point Pseudo-Random Cache Flushing, our cache SCAs had a confidence of bit recovery up to 65.1%. After implementing the novel solution, the cache SCAs completely failed and performance of the decapsulation function improved by 6.2%."

The paper also explores the usability of the PSC for combined data reception and energy harvesting purposes, demonstrating the feasibility of joining both functions onto a single component. The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated through a set of laboratory tests carried out by means of a dedicated experimental setup, emulating both day and night conditions. These tests proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach for depths up to 45 cm, demonstrating both data transmission and energy provisioning.

We use hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) to derive lightweight TC models that are accurate, efficient, and deployable on edge platforms. Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packetwise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over $99 \\%$ clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65 k parameters and 2 M FLOPs. Yet under perturbations of strength 0.1, their robustness diverges: the flat model retains over $\\mathbf{8 5 \\%}$ accuracy, while the time-series variant drops below 35%. Adversarial finetuning delivers robust gains, with flat-input accuracy exceeding $96 \\%$ and the time-series variant recovering over 60 percentage points in robustness, all without compromising efficiency. The results underscore how input structure influences adversarial vulnerability, and show that even compact, resource-efficient models can attain strong robustness, supporting their practical deployment in secure edge-based TC."

Two fine-tuned DistilBERT classifiers are trained separately for (i) email text and (ii) URLs, using large public datasets (82.5k emails and 641k URLs) to ensure coverage and general usability. The system’s methodology integrates robust preprocessing, class-imbalance handling, and standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC), while LIME provides human-interpretable, token-level explanations. Experimental results show high performance in controlled tests for both email and URL models (0.99–1.00 across key metrics), with the email model marginally stronger overall; PR/ROC curves and confusion matrices confirm reliability and low error rates. The approach demonstrates that compact transformers can meet accuracy and latency targets for phishing detection while maintaining transparency via XAI, and it contributes a deployable prototype (Flask backend + browser extension) suitable for real-world integration and further work on adversarial robustness and continuous learning."

    "abstract": "The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a sparse variant of large language models (LLMs), designed to hold a better balance between intelligent capability and computational overhead. Despite its benefits, MoE is still too expensive to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices, especially with the demands of on-device inference services. Recent research efforts often apply model compression techniques, such as quantization, pruning and merging, to restrict MoE complexity. Unfortunately, due to their predefined static model optimization strategies, they cannot always achieve the desired quality-overhead trade-off when handling multiple requests, finally degrading the on-device quality of service. These limitations motivate us to propose the D2MoE, an algorithm-system co-design framework that matches diverse task requirements by dynamically allocating the most proper bit-width to each expert. Specifically, inspired by the nested structure of matryoshka dolls, we propose the matryoshka weight quantization (MWQ) to progressively compress expert weights in a bit-nested manner and reduce the required runtime memory. On top of it, we further optimize the I/O-computation pipeline and design a heuristic scheduling algorithm following our hottest-expert-bit-first (HEBF) principle, which maximizes the expert parallelism between I/O and computation queue under constrained memory budgets, thus significantly reducing the idle temporal bubbles waiting for the experts to load. Evaluations on real edge devices show that D2MoE improves the overall inference throughput by up to 1.39× and reduces the peak memory footprint by up to 53% over the latest on-device inference frameworks, while still preserving comparable serving accuracy as its INT8 counterparts."

These mirror sites host APKs for direct download and sideloading, bypassing security checks typical of official stores and offering access to packages otherwise unavailable to some users. Despite their growing prominence, academic researchers have underexplored the APK mirror ecosystem. In this paper, we analyzed metadata from over 34M versions of approximately 27M unique Android packages collected from seven prominent APK mirror sites, alongside data from the Google Play Store and Amazon Appstore for comparison. Our findings reveal substantial variation in catalog size and package versioning across mirror sites. The smallest, APK Mirror, has only 17K packages while the largest, APK Combo, hosts over 12M packages, compared to Google Play Store's 3.1M packages, at the time of measurement. Mirror sites differ markedly from official stores in both breadth - hosting more unique packages - and depth - retaining multiple package versions, often serving as semi-historical archives. This offers a potentially rich record for researchers to access."

    "abstract": "RDMA datacenters are proliferating to meet the demand of emerging workloads such as AI training and inference as well as distributed storage. This trend has opened up a critical knowledge gap: the traffic characteristics of congestion in these networks remain unknown. We do not know, for example, which layers of the network are the most congested, if the network is load balanced effectively, how long congestion events last, and how accurate existing telemetry systems are in capturing congestion. This paper bridges this gap by investigating congestion in a large-scale RDMA datacenter dedicated to distributed AI training. We provide insights into three specific congestion patterns: (a) location and distribution in the network, (b) burstiness, e.g., the duration and synchrony of bursts, and (c) observability using existing telemetry methods. We show, for instance, that the deployment of Priority Flow Control (PFC) in RDMA networks has shifted the location of congestion one level up: from the edge-host in legacy TCP/IP datacenters to the network core in RDMA datacenters. At the same time, we show that the same protocol enables us to observe and understand congestion better, even bursty events. The findings of this research reveal open challenges for measuring, characterizing, and managing congestion in RDMA networks, paving the way for future research."

    "abstract": "Unlike traditional charging stations (TCS), wireless charging lanes (WCLs) enable electric vehicles (EV) to charge while in motion, thereby substantially reducing EV owners’ time costs. However, this advantage also intensifies competition with TCS, where uncertain and fluctuating charging prices further complicate pricing decisions for wireless charging lane manager (WCLM). These challenges highlight the necessity of a competitive and robust pricing strategy that not only ensures the profitability of WCLM but also supports efficient EV charging and routing. This paper presents a novel bilevel distributionally robust optimization model for determining optimal wireless charging prices in the integrated power and transportation networks. The model introduces a bilevel Stackelberg game framework to capture the competitive relationship between WCLM and TCS. Additionally, a distributionally robust optimization method is employed to account for intra-day charging price uncertainties at TCS. In the upper level, the wireless charging prices are optimized to maximize the profit of the WCLM. In the lower level, responding to the wireless charging prices released by the upper level and uncertain charging prices at TCS, the EV manager determines the optimal charging and routing strategy to minimize the worst-case charging cost and time cost while satisfying the power network and transportation network constraints. To effectively solve the proposed model, we firstly employ duality theory to transform the distributionally robust objective function into a tractable form. Next, we propose a value-function based method to convert the bilevel problem into a single-level problem. Subsequently, a decomposition and sample-based algorithm is developed to solve the single-level problem. Finally, a set of methods are proposed to linearize and convexify the subproblem within the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pricing scheme leads to an average profit increase of 86.16% compared to the traditional pricing scheme."

The advantage of this control scheme lies in its ability to mitigate performance degradation caused by model inaccuracies. Firstly, a dynamic model for MHSTs is established and then transformed into an equivalent linearized form that solely relies on input and output (I/O) data. Secondly, considering power limitations in the traction network and external FDIAs during direct train-to-train (T2T) communication, a data-driven coordinated MFAC scheme for MHSTs is developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the controller, coordination performance among MHSTs, as well as the impact of external constraints on MHSTs are verified through numerical simulations."

    "abstract": "Object navigation (ObjcetNav), which enables an agent to seek any instance of an object category, has shown great advances. However, current agents are built upon occlusion-prone visual observations or compressed 2-D maps, which hinder their embodied perception of 3-D scene geometry. Furthermore, existing methods usually decouple ObjectNav into the exploration and exploitation subtasks, easily leading to ambiguous object localization and blind exploration. To address these issues, we first propose an embodied contrastive learning (ECL) method with geometric consistency (GC) and behavioral awareness (BA), which motivates agents to encode 3-D scene layouts and semantic cues actively. The BA is modeled by predicting navigational actions based on multiframe visual images, as behaviors causing differences between adjacent visual sensations are crucial for learning correlations among continuous visions. The GC is modeled by aligning the behavior-aware visual stimulus with 3-D semantic shapes through unsupervised contrastive learning. Then, based on the above ECL pretraining, a coarse-to-fine ObjectNav policy with explorer and discriminator cooperation is proposed, inspired by the treasure-hunting mindset. Concretely, the explorer is designed to adaptively switch the action spaces, thereby switching the global and local exploration thoughts according to the accumulated scene priors. The discriminator is designed to discriminate the target’s authenticity using behavior-aware visual features and geometric invariance priors, which permits mimicking the human behavior of “approaching to confirm” when distinguishing objects from a distance. As expected, our ECL method performs well on object detection (ObjDet) and instance segmentation (InstSeg) tasks. Our ECL-enhanced ObjectNav strategy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on Matterport3D (MP3D), Gibson, and HM3D datasets."

Existing approaches often rely on complex, task-specific architectures, leading to redundancy and limited generalization. Our previous work, VSCode, introduced a generalist model that effectively handles four SOD tasks and two COD tasks. VSCode leveraged VST as its foundation model and incorporated 2D prompts within an encoder-decoder framework to capture domain and task-specific knowledge, utilizing a prompt discrimination loss to optimize the model. Building upon the proven effectiveness of our previous work VSCode, we identify opportunities to further strengthen generalization capabilities through focused modifications in model design and optimization strategy. To unlock this potential, we propose VSCode-v2, an extension that introduces a Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE) layer to generate adaptive prompts. We also redesign the training process into a two-stage approach: first learning shared features across tasks, then capturing specific characteristics. To preserve knowledge during this process, we incorporate distillation from our conference version model. Furthermore, we propose a contrastive learning mechanism with data augmentation to strengthen the relationships between prompts and feature representations. VSCode-v2 demonstrates balanced performance improvements across six SOD and COD tasks. Moreover, VSCode-v2 effectively handles various multimodal inputs and exhibits zero-shot generalization capability to novel tasks, such as RGB-D Video SOD."

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a critical cross-modal task for scene understanding, which aims to detect visual relations in an image. Most SGG methods are significantly affected by highly skewed long-tailed bias, and prefer predicates with sufficient samples regardless of the semantic accuracy. Current unbiased SGG methods focus on compensating for the imbalanced long-tailed distribution, but they are fragile to dataset changes. The fundamental cause for this problem is the limited generalization ability, thus the diversity of classes needs to be modeled explicitly. By imitating the human cognition, a Grounded Cognition Method (GCM) for unbiased scene graph generation is proposed here, where the simulation, bodily states, and situated action are modeled. For simulations, an Out Domain Knowledge Injection module is proposed to expand the model's visual perception by reducing the reliance on an isolated class. Meanwhile, a Semantic Group Aware Synthesizer is proposed for linguistic perception modeling by categorizing specific predicate classes into a high-level semantic group. For bodily states, the modalities are erased separately to imitate the limited state of physical senses, which forces the model to rely on the remaining modality to compensate for the understanding of the whole scene. For situated actions, a Shapley Enhanced Multimodal Counterfactual module is proposed to model the dynamic interaction with the environment and cope with diverse contexts. Experiments on Visual Genome, GQA, and Open Images V6 demonstrate the effectiveness of our GCM, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides relieving the long-tailed bias, GCM achieves a balance between head and tail performance.

    "abstract": "Owing to the resilience in structure and adaptability to the environment, tensegrity robots have a variety of potential applications in environmental exploration, search and rescue, and other fields. However, the interaction with the environment could be unpredictable, which requires the robots to be equipped with the ability of environment perception. This article presents a junction tensegrity robot (JTBot), which consists of both flexible and rigid struts, for the inspection of unstructured pipelines. Slender elastic beams are utilized to replace the rigid rods to enhance the robot’s dexterity and flexibility by generating large-scale deformations. Compact deflection sensors are embedded onto the flexible struts to enable the JTBot with the capability to estimate its equilibrium state and to predict the contact conditions with the environment. A closed-form model of the robot’s kinetostatics is established to characterize the interaction behavior of such a cable-constrained flexible mechanism efficiently. Hence, in situ gait optimization can be implemented for the crawling robot with the aid of the intrinsic environmental perception. A prototype of the JTBot is developed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed design, on which a variety of validation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the developed JTBot is able to pass through complex pipelines in a dexterous way. In addition, a demonstration is provided to illustrate the JTBot’s capability of defect detection in unstructured pipelines."

    "abstract": "Efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is pivotal for warehouse logistics. While existing learning-based methods primarily rely on computationally intensive grid-based representations, topological maps offer a more flexible and scalable alternative - though this approach remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for topological MAPF with three key innovations: (1) a graph-structured POMDP formulation utilizing our Breadth-First Neighbor-Limited Search (BFNLS) algorithm to define scalable observation/action spaces while maintaining fixed dimension; (2) a Graph Structure Awareness (GSA) model that combines spectral ( eigenvalue-based) and spatial (graph convolutional network-based) analysis to integrate local subgraph features with global topological importance metrics; and (3) a cooperative MARL architecture employing Value Decomposition Networks (VDN) to explicitly model agent dependencies through graph-aware credit assignment. Simulation results show our method achieves superior success rates compared to baseline methods and planning efficiency than search-based methods, and the real-robot experiments show the effectiveness in a physical setting."

    "abstract": "In this work, a 2D axisymmetric FEM model was produced to simulate OpenStar Technologies' Junior Core Magnet. The model was created in COMSOL Multiphysics, with electromagnetic and thermal coupling. This model was used to simulate the Core Magnet under full-field conditions, and was verified against the specifications of the Core Magnet. Producing the model involved creating lookup tables of homogenised electrical and thermal properties for each of the 14 solder impregnated coils, applying coordinate transformations to these lookup tables, and creating 2D axisymmetric equivalent geometry of the complex copper interface buses and plates between the coils. This paper provides insight into understanding the behaviour of NI coils and how they influence quench dynamics, current redistribution, and thermal response. The modelling approach demonstrates that computationally efficient simulations can be achieved through homogenisation and geometry simplification, offering a valuable tool for the design, optimisation, and safety assessment of large-scale superconducting magnets."

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals has many potential applications. However, the development of an emotion recognition model for real-world deployment encounters significant setbacks in learning an invariant representation due to data distribution shift. Some prior studies adopted domain adaptation methods to tackle this issue. However, these studies perform marginally to tackle distribution shift in the source data and neglect to focus on the extraction of domain and target-specific features, which are crucial for domain invariant representation learning. In this study, we propose an assisted domain adaptive representation learning (ADARL) method that learns domain invariant and emotion-specific features for recognizing emotions across different subjects. The proposed architecture introduces novel attention modules to segregate domain-specific and emotion-specific feature maps by exploiting the inter-relationship between different channels and bands. The domain-specific residual feature maps (peripheral features) extracted by the proposed attention mechanism are used to assist the domain discriminator that forces the model to learn a generalized representation of EEG signals. To tackle the inter-subject variability in the source data, we introduce a novel class-aware compactness loss function to improve the domain adaptation transfer efficiency. The experiments conducted on three EEG datasets (SEED, SEED-IV, and DEAP) demonstrate that the ADARL method significantly improves emotion recognition performance and efficiently alleviates the domain shift problem by learning a generalized representation of EEG signals."

    "abstract": "This study compares a mercury sequential extraction procedure (SEP) and a methylmercury selective extraction in soil and sediment to study the correlation between methylmercury concentration and metal bound to the organic fraction determined by a sequential extraction procedure. Five different reference materials by their origin (marine sediments and soil) and by the total mercury concentration were analyzed. Fraction and solvents used for SEP were as follows: F1 ion-exchange form and bound to carbonate with ammonium acetate; F2 reductive form bound to manganese-iron oxides with hydroxylammonium chloride; $\\mathbf{F 3}$ form bound to humic acids with $\\mathbf{H C l}$; $\\mathbf{F 4}$ form bound to fulvic acid with NaOH; F 5 sulphide with HNO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</inf>; F 6 insoluble residue with aqua regia. For methylmercury (MeHg) extraction, HCl was used for hydrolyzing, Toluene as organic solvent and L-Cysteine solution as specific solvent to linked MeHg. The preliminary results of this work are interesting because it allows to estimate the amount of MeHg primarily based on the organic-bound fraction ($\\mathbf{F 3}+\\mathbf{F 4}$), while the total mercury content alone is not a reliable predictor of MeHg formation ($\\mathrm{MeHg} / \\mathrm{T}-\\mathrm{Hg}$ ranged from $1 \\%$ to $2 \\%$ and $\\mathrm{F} 3+\\mathrm{F} 4 / \\mathrm{T}$ Hg ratio between $11 \\%$ and $21 \\%$), through a simple approach without resorting to complex instruments. In addition, this study demonstrated the comparability between the two methods of organic mercury speciation, the operational one by sequential extraction, related to the organic mercury fraction, and the analytical one by single extraction, related to the determination of methylmercury."

    "abstract": "Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, faces three major challenges in practical applications: optimization difficulties caused by non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data, distribution shifts introduced by new clients joining in dynamic environments, and privacy threats such as model inversion attacks. Existing methods often address individual challenges at the expense of performance in other aspects, with the conflict between privacy protection and model performance being particularly prominent. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for dynamic Non-IID data based on differential privacy and adaptive knowledge distillation (DP-ADKD-FL), which addresses multiple challenges through three innovative mechanisms: (1) a sensitivity-based parameter-layered differential privacy mechanism that provides differentiated protection for parameters of varying importance, minimizing the impact of noise on performance; (2) an adaptive knowledge distillation framework that dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer strategies based on client distribution characteristics, effectively responding to distribution changes; and (3) a dynamic privacy budget regulation strategy that optimizes privacy resource allocation according to training stages and the degree of distribution changes. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DP-ADKD-FL not only significantly outperforms existing methods in privacy protection metrics such as defense against inversion attacks, but also surpasses baseline methods without privacy protection in model performance, especially showing excellent adaptability in dynamic environments."

This paper presents a curvature-optimized synthetic aperture focusing technique (CO-SAFT) for high-resolution ultrasonic imaging of sub-millimeter internal defects in aerospace curved structures with unknown surface profiles. The phased array transducer acquires full matrix capture (FMC) data by B-scan immersion testing. Artifact suppression is achieved through threshold-based filtering and data fusion, followed by reconstruction of the surface morphology using cubic Hermite interpolation. The robotic arm adjusts the orientation of the single-element probe to the reconstructed surface to ensure normal incidence at each scanning position. Experiments performed on a multi-curvature aluminum specimen with 1 mm artificial defects show a positioning error of 0.5 mm."

Although the dependence between X and Y in each set of samples can be measured separately using MI, these estimates cannot be compared directly if they are based on samples from a non-stationary distribution. Here, we propose an alternative measure for characterising how the dependence between X and Y as defined by one set of samples is expressed in another, cross MI. We present a comprehensive set of simulation studies sampling data with X-Y dependencies to explore this measure. Finally, we discuss how this relates to measures of model fit in linear regression, and some future applications in neuroimaging data analysis."

Recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling relational structures in network traffic, while quantum machine learning offers new possibilities for enhancing representation power and generalization through quantum feature encoding. This paper proposes a quantum-enhanced graph neural network architecture designed for edge classification in IoT traffic graphs, which is called QEGraph-SAGE. By incorporating a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as a classifier, the model is capable of capturing complex, nonlinear interactions between connected nodes and their associated features. This model is evaluated on three widely used benchmark datasets, including CTU-13, ToN-IoT, and CIC-IDS2017. Experimental results show that QEGraphSAGE consistently outperforms Edge-Graph Sample and Aggregate (E-GraphSAGE) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) baselines in terms of detection rate (DR) across diverse attack types. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical graph models in enhancing the robustness and expressiveness of intrusion detection systems for next-generation IoT security."

This study presents a sustainable method for recovering cellulose acetate from smoked cigarette butts using green solvents—specifically deionized water, sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions, and ethanol—under varying conditions of temperature and concentration. Characterization of the purified material was conducted through FT-IR, TGA-DSC, NMR, and FESEM techniques. Ethanol at $75 \\%$ concentration was found to be the most effective in removing organic and inorganic contaminants while preserving the CA structure. The optimized cleaning involved a three-cycle washing protocol, yielding cellulose acetate suitable for film production. Ethyl acetate was identified as the optimal solvent for casting uniform films from the recovered polymer. This approach offers a low-cost, eco-friendly pathway for recycling cigarette waste into biopolymer materials, contributing to pollution mitigation and circular material use."

One of the main challenge is to enhance spectral efficiency as it lead to higher throughput and system capacity.

Moreover, there is many possible scheduler to try in order to find the best ones for diverse contexts. An approach that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes a conceivable solution. In this paper we introduce a new AI tool that selects and evaluates schedulers that enhance spectral efficiency for different contexts. Our approach is to train the AI model on several traffic load, to evaluate and select schedulers based on a general scheduling formula, resulting in an explainable model for traffic scheduling. After the training, the appropriate scheduler is used for each traffic load conditions. In addition, our tool detects terms of the formula that does not have a positive impact on enhancing spectral efficiency. Simulation results show that the obtained scheduler outperform state of the art algorithms such as RR, MaxSNR and PF."

We give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents’ data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some restrictions on the privacy level and the agents’ connectivity, which illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results."

The practical scenarios where unpaired multiview data with missing values have wide applications in generative learning, cross-modal retrieval, and wireless device identification problems. Following the perspective that the shared information between the incomplete multiview data aligns with the cluster targets, recent works have generalized the well-known common information frameworks in information theory multiview learning problems, with improved performance reported. Different from previous works, we extend the frameworks to incomplete multiview clustering problems and propose an efficient solver: Wyner Incomplete MultiView Clustering (WyIMVC). Interestingly, the common randomness in WyIMVC allows for joint clustering and missing value inference in contrast to the compared methods in the literature. Moreover, leveraging the difference-of-convex structure of the formulated problems, we propose an efficient solver with a convergence guarantee independent of initialization. Empirically, our solver outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers in a range of incomplete multiview datasets with varying numbers of views and dimensions."

The research project proposes green, engineering-based solutions that transform both types of waste into valuable resources. The first versatile by-product of this ecodesign process is shell powder, which will be used as a secondary raw material alongside sediments and binders to create three innovative products in four European ports: paving blocks, breakwaters, and mass stabilisation materials.

A prototype of a supermobile plant equipped with additional modules will enable the products to be manufactured and replicated in situ. All activities began with multidisciplinary dialogue and multi-field research, involving bio-, geo-, hydro- and chemo aspects, as well as legislative and economic expertise. Once the results of the GREENLIFE4SEAS project have been validated, monitored and generalised using physics-based and computer-driven approaches, they will optimise the EU’s environmental policy for a circular blue economy.

Analysis of stranding data collected from multiple databases, shows that a total of $\\mathbf{3 8 1 6}$ stranding events of six cetacean species were recorded between 2000 and 2021 in the Mediterranean Sea. The main evidence is that in $87.7 \\%$ of stranding events the cause of death was unknown, while bycatch resulted to be the most frequent identified cause ($\\mathbf{N}=\\mathbf{3 2 1}, \\mathbf{8. 4} \\%$). Significant positive trends in annual strandings events were detected for the striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba, the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, and the common dolphin Delphinus delphis. Bycatch showed different trends at the species level, with a significant reduction in striped dolphins strandings and an increase for common bottlenose dolphins. Results suggest that juvenile striped dolphins appear to be significantly more vulnerable to both bycatch and collision compared to other life stages, while in common bottlenose dolphins these impacts are more evenly distributed across all age classes, with no significant differences between life stages. Additionally, juveniles of common bottlenose dolphins showed significantly lower natural mortality compared to other age classes. Although stranding events are considerable sources of data and offer cost-effective tools for monitoring these species, the lack of strong Mediterranean coordination still prevents the collection of information in a systematic and uniform way, limiting the possibility to conduct robust assessments at Mediterranean scale."

Nine machine learning models are trained and tested across these different resolutions in order to identify how temporal granularity affects predictive reliability.

The validity of this model was verified through ground - based test runs of water ramjet engines. Based on this model, simulations were conducted on the internal flow fields of water ramjet engines with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5,7,9$</tex>, and 9 spray holes (where the arrangement was varied). The resulting outputs included temperature distribution contour plots of the engine's internal flow field, three - dimensional temperature surface plots on cross - sections before and after the water injection nozzle, particle temperature and distribution plots, along with the specific impulse, specific impulse efficiency, and combustion efficiency of the engine under different numbers and arrangements of spray holes. The findings indicate that an increase in the number of spray holes and a change in their arrangement lead to a more uniform spatial distribution of water droplets. This enhancement in the distribution promotes a stronger mixing effect between water droplets and high - temperature gas, thus facilitating the aluminum - water reaction and improving the operational performance of the water ramjet engine. When designing the number and arrangement of spray holes in porous nozzles, it is advisable to maximize the number of spray holes while meeting the design requirements. The arrangement should be multi level and multi - directional."

    "abstract": "Levenshtein’s sequence reconstruction model plays an essential role in information retrieval in DNA-based storage systems. In this model, a word ${\\text{x}} \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}_q^n$ is transmitted through N noisy channels, and the goal is to recover the original word exactly, or with a small uncertainty ${\\mathcal{L}}$, using the outputs from these channels. Errors occurring in the channels usually involve substitutions, insertions or deletions. In this paper, we focus on insertion errors, which we represent using (so-called) insertion vectors. One of the main questions in this context is determining the minimum number of channels N required to recover the word either unambiguously or within a given precision ${\\mathcal{L}}$. The original formulation of Levenshtein’s reconstruction problem requires that all the outputs from the channels are distinct. However, different channels may produce the same output word even when different errors occur. In this paper, we investigate two generalized reconstruction models where the channels are allowed to produce the same output word as long as, in each channel, different errors occur (that is, the errors correspond to different insertion vectors). Our objective is to determine the number of channels N required to uniquely recover the transmitted word x under these conditions. We present several results in this direction, some of which are optimal."

To address the high computational costs and slow iteration of traditional CFD simulations and experiments, this study proposes a flow field prediction method based on dimensionless characteristic parameters. Leveraging a large-scale dataset covering a wide range of operating conditions, we systematically compare backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF) in terms of prediction accuracy, generalization ability, and computational efficiency. Results indicate that the optimal BPNN model performs excellently both within and beyond the sample space, achieving an average relative error below 1 % in extrapolation. Ensemble methods deliver faster predictions and better capture discontinuities such as shock waves, but their stability requires further improvement. This study offers a solution that balances accuracy and efficiency for rapid and accurate turbomachinery flow field prediction, and provides a reference for the development of more robust predictive approaches."

    "abstract": "Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) exhibit distinct advantages over conventional rigid mechanisms in terms of lower mass and extended workspace, demonstrating critical applications in aerospace engineering, including but not limited to astronomical observation, astronaut rehabilitation training, and motion simulation. To address the stringent requirement for high-dynamic trajectory tracking capability of end-effectors, this study conducts an investigation into a force-position hybrid control strategy for an eight-cable-driven six-degree-of-freedom parallel robot. Considering flexibility of the cables, a time-varying flexible multibody dynamic model is developed to more accurately capture the nonlinearities and rigid-flexible coupling effects inherent in the system. To satisfy unidirectional force transmission characteristics of cables, a closed-form force distribution (CFFD) algorithm is introduced to achieve coordinated regulation of cable tensions under actuation redundancy, thereby ensuring effective utilization of redundancy and compliance with dynamic tension constraints. Building upon the tension distribution framework, a hybrid control architecture is further proposed, comprising two independent PID-based control loops for position and force regulation. This architecture integrates feedback from both cable tensions and end-effector position to simultaneously control the end-effector trajectory and real-time cable tension. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy not only ensures accurate trajectory tracking but also effectively suppresses abrupt tension fluctuations, resulting in a well-balanced performance across both tracking precision and tension coordination control."

This paper proposes a new reversible data hiding method that employs an improved pixel value ordering technique on high-bit segments. The method takes advantage of pixel correlation for embedding data in encrypted images. The original image is encrypted through block shuffling and pixel permutation to preserve correlation, and the encrypted image is divided into non-overlapping blocks. To minimize the difference of encrypted pixels within each block and to enhance the embedding capacity, the high-bit segments of each encrypted block are extracted for embedding data. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method ensures the reversibility while significantly improving embedding capacity, achieving up to 262,000 bits for smooth images and 179,000 bits for complex images, outperforming previous methods."

Most current devices for measuring glucose are costly and painful. We propose GlucoSense, a non-invasive glucose sensing solution on mobile devices. GlucoSense builds on the fact that glucose is an optically active molecule, which interacts with various wavelengths. We first conduct spectral analysis to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring glucose in the visible and near-infrared range (400–1000 nm), which is the range available on mobile devices. We also identify the relative importance of various spectral bands in this range. We further propose multiple practical designs for obtaining the required spectral bands for measuring glucose. We then design GlucoSense exploiting the sensing capabilities of modern smartphones combined with machine learning models. We conduct an ethics-approved user study with a diverse set of participants in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). We compare GlucoSense against a widely-used, FDA-approved glucose measuring device. Our results show that 80.4% of GlucoSense predictions are within Zone A (clinically accurate), and the remaining 19.3% are in Zone B (clinically acceptable) of the Clarke Error Grid (CEG). In addition, 99.7% of the predictions are within the None and Slight risk zones of the Surveillance Error Grid (SEG), indicating their high accuracy. Both CEG and SEG are standard metrics for assessing glucose-measuring devices. These results were obtained by GlucoSense running on unmodified phones in realistic environments with diverse illuminations."

This has led to the idea of introducing an outer-level objective function to select a solution with the specific desired properties. We propose an iterative method that combines an incremental algorithm with a broadcast algorithm, both based on the principles of federated learning. Under appropriate assumptions, we establish the convergence results of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate its performance, we present two numerical examples related to binary classification and a location problem."

    "abstract": "As the 5G network rapidly expands, more edge servers are being deployed to provide more efficient and low-latency mobile services. However, limited edge resources constrain users' demand response, while continuous server operation leads to significant energy consumption, undermining the sustainability of the multi-access edge computing (MEC) system. Existing resource allocation methods rely on accurate user locations, which can lead to privacy exposure, while protection techniques often result in significant service degradation due to spatial distortion. Moreover, user mobility in MEC systems poses new challenges for edge resource management, which requires dynamic server collaboration and user data migration, incurring additional costs and delays.

    "abstract": "Driven by growing concerns over global energy consumption, improving energy efficiency in the manufacturing sector is increasingly vital, especially for energy-intensive batch processes. Real-time pricing (RTP) of electricity, a dynamic demand-side management strategy, offers opportunities to reduce energy costs by scheduling production during low-price periods. However, integrating RTP into batch manufacturing scheduling introduces challenges in balancing energy savings with timely customer contract fulfillment, requiring multi-timescale coordination. This paper presents a hierarchical Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework integrated with a System-Level Energy-Efficiency Digital Twin (SLEE-DT) for energy-aware batch manufacturing scheduling. The SLEE-DT provides a unified system representation, capturing the dynamic interactions between production and inventory stages. The hierarchical MPC consists of two levels: an upper-level offline optimization that determines long-term inventory and production strategies, and a lower-level runtime controller that performs dynamic scheduling in response to system states and RTP signals. A case study of a battery production line demonstrates that the proposed framework reduces energy expenditures while maintaining reliable fulfillment of customer contracts, highlighting its potential for scalable, cost-efficient, and sustainable manufacturing operations."

Traditional biomechanical analysis methods, especially the finite element analysis, require extensive computational resources, precise material property definitions, and complex meshing processes to accurately model the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine. While deep learning is introduced to enhance efficiency and accuracy, challenges like data dependency and lack of physical consistency remain. Methods: We propose a novel framework that consists of a 3D generative adversarial network for data augmentation together with a dual-channel vision transformer to extract geometric and physical information. We also introduce a physics-guided mechanism into training phase, ensuring model consistency with mechanical principles. Results: The proposed method achieved an Intersection over Union of 0.8332 and a Mean Squared Error of 0.0002. The five vertebrae of the lumbar spine are processed in 87 milliseconds, which is approximately 3000 times faster than traditional finite element methods. Conclusion: Our framework demonstrates high accuracy and substantial computational efficiency, offering a reliable alternative to conventional biomechanical modeling. Significance: This enables real-time lumbar spine analysis for diagnosis, surgical planning, and personalized treatment."

OTFS modulation exhibits robustness against Doppler shifts and multipath fading, while Spatial Modulation (SM) enhances the spectral efficiency by utilizing the antenna index to encode additional information. However, imperfect CSI due to realistic channel estimation errors encountered in rapidly varying channel conditions significantly degrades the system performance. We analyze the effects of imperfect CSI on the BER performance of an SM-OTFS system for different equalization methods and SM orders. The closed-form expressions derived provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between the equalizer type, channel estimation accuracy, and system performance, demonstrating the necessity for robust channel estimation and resilient equalization strategies in high-mobility environments."

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential for enabling reliable communication in high-mobility environments. However, the effectiveness of OTFS receivers relies on the inherent characteristic of the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel, where the sparsity of the discretized channel varies across different communication scenarios. For instance, the fractional Doppler effect reduces the inherent channel sparsity, which consequently degrades channel estimation accuracy and increases the complexity of symbol detection. Traditional algorithms relying on fixed sparsity priors often require manual design, while purely data-driven deep learning (DL) methods typically struggle to generalize across diverse channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised DL-based plug-and-play (PnP) framework that provides a flexible solution for OTFS receiver design. The proposed framework can be applied to both channel estimation and symbol detection, jointly leveraging the flexibility of optimization-based methods and the powerful generalization capability of data-driven models. Specifically, a lightweight encoder-decoder network (EDN) is incorporated as an implicit channel prior for channel estimation, enabling robust performance across varying levels of channel sparsity. Furthermore, for symbol detection, we realize the PnP framework with a time-domain matrix inversion for model-based equalization, followed by a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) pre-trained for specific constellations, thereby achieving low complexity and enabling flexible adaptation to various modulation formats. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm."

    "abstract": "We present VolMoVis, a method for dynamic tomographic reconstruction that supports real-time volume generation and volumetric motion visualization from 2D projections. Visualizing the motion of 3D anatomical structures, such as organs and tumors, is critical for computer-aided interventions. However, conventional 4D volumetric reconstruction methods typically produce a limited set of volumes at discrete phases, suffering from low temporal resolution. Moreover, it often requires extensive segmentation of 3D structures or regions for visualizing volumetric data, making it challenging to segment and visualize dynamic volumes in real-time. To address these challenges, VolMoVis framework employs a continuous implicit neural representation that decomposes the dynamic volumetric data into a static reference volume and a continuous deformation field. This decomposition, along with an efficient deformation network, enables our framework to achieve real-time volume generation and volumetric visualization of continuous anatomical motions. We evaluate VolMoVis on both 4D digital phantoms and real patient datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for accurate anatomical reconstruction and motion tracking. Furthermore, we highlight its capabilities in real-time simultaneous volume generation and tumor segmentation for visualizing dynamic volumes and 4D tumor tracking, showcasing its potential in image-guided radiation therapy"

    "abstract": "Aiming at the flow field characteristics of cavity collapse during the cavity closure stage under high-speed water entry conditions, high-speed jets and their influence on the instantaneous load distribution, this study adopted the bidirectional fluid-structure interaction method, combined with the multiphase flow model, cavitation model and overlapping mesh technology, to establish a numerical simulation model of the entire process of high-speed water entry, and conducted numerical simulation of the entire vertical water entry process. The results show that there are a large number of complex flow field structures in the cavity collapse stage, and the process has strong nonlinear loads. As the cavity collapses, the angle formed between the posterior boundary of cavity and the projectile surface gradually increases due to the backflow jet driven by the pressure gradient. The backflow jet exerts a significant impact on the tail, causing stress concentration in the structure to reach the same magnitude as the impact upon water entry, posing a considerable threat to the structural safety and easily leading to structural damage at the tail and ballistic instability."

This study investigates the bioindicator potential of two Mediterranean demosponges, Petrosia (Petrosia) ficiformis and Sarcotragus spinosulus, by analysing HMs accumulation in specimens collected from two sites in the northwestern Ionian Sea: the industrially impacted Mar Grande of Taranto (TA) and the marine protected area of Porto Cesareo (LE), both located in Puglia, southern Italy. ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry) analyses revealed species- and site-specific accumulation patterns. P. ficiformis showed broad-spectrum metal accumulation, particularly in Mar Grande of Taranto, suggesting its utility as a long-term pollution indicator. In contrast, S. spinosulus exhibited extreme Cu enrichment at Porto Cesareo Strea, likely due to marina-related activity, highlighting its sensitivity to recent anthropogenic developments. These findings emphasize the need to integrate species-specific biological traits into marine biomonitoring strategies and support the potential of sponges not only as bioindicators but also as bioremediation tools in heavy metal-impacted environments."

    "abstract": "The Solar Array Drive Assembly (SADA) and the Control Moment Gyroscope (CMG) are core components for power transmission and attitude control in spacecraft. During long-term operation, conductive wear debris is inevitably generated within the assembly. Under the combined effects of microgravity and multiple physical fields, this debris tends to aggregate, thereby increasing the risk of internal arcing and breakdown, which may ultimately lead to spacecraft failures. This study develops a theoretical model describing the behavior of conductive wear debris under the coupling of microgravity and multi-physics fields. The dynamic characteristics and accumulation mechanisms of conductive debris within the SADA are systematically investigated. To establish the dynamic model of conductive debris, this work first constructs several physical field models. Based on these models, the dynamics equations of debris under microgravity are derived. Numerical simulations are then performed to analyze debris trajectories under various initial conditions. The results indicate that the electric field force is the dominant factor influencing debris motion. Under its influence, the debris migrates toward the outer wall of the slip ring, where it eventually forms an accumulation layer."

In this paper, we give some justifications for the observed relationship between these two ratios and then analyze these ratios for two classes of log-supermodular graphical models."

    "abstract": "The investigation of Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability is pivotal across various disciplines, including astrophysics, aerospace, and environmental science, offering profound insights into the dynamics of interfacial behaviors and multiphase flows. This study employs the Weighted Compact Nonlinear Scheme (WCNS), Roe's method, and a third-order Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta method within a Matlab framework to numerically solve the two-dimensional Euler equations, thereby simulating the R-T instability phenomenon. Through an analysis of the flow field density distribution map, this research elucidates the developmental trajectory of the R-T instability, scrutinizing the formation and expansion of the mixing zone. A comparative study is conducted on simulation outcomes utilizing varying density ratios, grid densities, and interpolation schemes. The findings indicate that an increased density ratio not only accentuates instability but also intensifies mixing. Moreover, the selection of mesh density and numerical scheme is identified as a significant determinant of the simulation's fidelity. While the program effectively captures the nuances of R-T instability, it currently operates in a serial mode, highlighting a need for enhanced computational efficiency to meet the demands of more complex and large-scale simulations."

Specifically, this paper first decomposes the eBCH code into a concatenated structure comprising an outer code and a Reed-Muller inner code. The outer code has a parity-check matrix characterized by a special block structure, which reveals that the positions of all frozen bits (including frozen zero bits and dynamic frozen bits) in the eBCH code are closely related to the index weights of elements from the perspective of the polar code. Subsequently, the CPC-SCL decoding of the eBCH codes is proposed by utilizing the cyclic property of codewords and parity-check-aided successive cancellation list (PC-SCL) decoding. Simulations also demonstrate that, over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, the proposed decoding can achieve near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance at n = 64, k = 24 or 45."

Our system leverages speech recognition to guide students through critical reading processes, fosters self-regulated learning, and complements existing academic support services. We also discuss copyright management, ethical safeguards, and equitable use guidelines developed with faculty collaboration to ensure responsible deployment. Finally, we illustrate how the system engages students in using effective reading strategies as it provides feedback and phonetic analysis in less than 3 seconds after reading. Preliminary results show that such a system can promote more equitable, inclusive, and autonomous access to success in higher education."

In view of this problem, the composite structure of fiber shell and skirt of solid rocket motor is taken as the sample. According to the relevant test standards and the actual loading conditions of solid rocket motor, the tension-tension fatigue test scheme is developed. The static tensile tests are carried out on the fatigued samples to obtain residual failure load after each fatigue condition; The CT scan tests are carried out on the fatigued samples to obtain the porosity of the adhesive layer. The porosity of the adhesive layer is used to characterize the damage of the sample during the fatigue, and the relationship between the residual failure load of the sample and the porosity of the adhesive layer is constructed. It is found that the residual failure load decreases with the increase of load level and cycles. A processing method of load level-cycles equivalence principle is proposed referring to the time-temperature equivalence principle. A load level-cycles equivalence model has been established. The proposed model is verified, and the mean error is less than 5%, which shows that the proposed model is valid and feasible."

Ground-based safety testing is a key foundational step in validating wind-resistant designs and addressing this challenge. This paper proposes a research approach that combines scaled wind tunnel flight testing with wind field simulation technology to achieve wind resistance performance validation of aircraft in a wind tunnel environment. It systematically introduces three testing techniques—wind tunnel free-flight, virtual flight, and wind field simulation—and analyzes their application prospects in the development of low-altitude aircraft. The results indicate that current wind tunnel wind resistance testing technology has established a foundational capability. By comprehensively designing test programs, a rapid experimental validation method for studying the wind resistance performance of Low Altitude Aircraft can be established. This approach provides optimization insights for early-stage configuration and control system design, and serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the wind resistance characteristics of prototypes."

In this market, agents form coalitions, with each coalition sharing a unit capacity of a selected route and making payments to cover edge prices. Our focus is on the existence and computation of market equilibrium, where challenges arise from the interdependence between coalition formation among strategic agents with heterogeneous preferences and route selection that induces a network flow under integral capacity constraints. To address this interplay between coalition formation and network capacity utilization, we introduce a novel approach based on combinatorial auction theory and network flow theory. We establish sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents’ preferences that guarantee both the existence and polynomial-time computation of a market equilibrium. Additionally, we identify a particular market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents and the outcome is equivalent to the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-period settings and general networks, showing that when the sufficient conditions are not met, an equilibrium may still exist but requires more complex, path-based pricing mechanisms that set differentiated prices based on agents’ preference parameters."

This approach bridges the critical gap between research and deployment, enabling performance analysis at a pace impractical with physical hardware alone. We demonstrate how this digital twin pipeline is essential for robust Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in IoT environments, allowing for scalable, cost-effective testing of decentralized tiny ML. Our results across simulation, emulation, and a cluster of real ESP32-S3 microcontrollers show that our twins faithfully reproduce physical device behavior, making it a valuable framework for advancing tiny, decentralized AI."

We address this gap by collecting measurements from the web browser and the data-plane (IP of responding server &amp; latency) on the same device. A challenge to apply this approach in the Global South is the lower density of observation points in measurement infrastructure. To address this, we build a software suite that automatically collects measurements in various countries from a volunteer's computer. Our suite is interoperable with all major OSes and requires limited user intervention.

We first design the PR codes using primitive polynomials whose supports form a Golomb ruler, enabling the construction of a 4-cycle-free parity-check matrix (PCM) without the need for auxiliary variable nodes. We introduce a second PCM derived by sorting channel log-likelihood ratios and applying Gaussian elimination. The double-bases decoder operates by running BP decoding in parallel on both PCMs, and selecting the candidate codeword with the shorter Euclidean distance to the received signal. Simulation results show that the proposed double-bases BP approach can outperform the multiple-bases BP decoder while reducing the number of required PCMs and complexity. The PR code paired with the proposed decoder offers competitive performance compared to 5G-polar, RM, and LDPC codes in the short blocklength regime."

    "abstract": "Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key novelty of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that eliminates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these problem classes, DACE, without requiring domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with even better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators."

    "abstract": "This article presents an impact-aware manipulation framework and its application to logistics, where the challenges related to the booming of e-commerce have increased the need for faster and more flexible package handling solutions. Particularly, the proposed impact-aware framework addresses the problem of swiftly grabbing and placing objects in depalletizing tasks with dual-arm robotic systems. Impact-aware robotics leverages intentional collisions to achieve dynamic interactions and thus has the potential to be faster and more energy efficient than the state of the art based on quasi-static interactions with objects or environments. The generation of desired impacts (contacts at a nonzero relative speed), generally avoided in classical robotics, brings multiple challenges encompassing the generation of robust motions, managing the impact with the object, dealing with the physical constraints of the robotic systems, contact state sensing, and simulation of contact behavior. To tackle these challenges, we developed, within the European Union (EU)-funded project Impact-Aware Manipulation (I.AM.), impact-aware technologies that yield an integrated impact-aware solution. The proposed framework exploits nonsmooth mechanics to provide robot‒object‒environment impact models; it uses dynamical systems (DSs) to generate nominal and contingency motions with intentional impacts; it leverages quadratic programming (QP)-based control to provide motion execution with the ability to enforce hardware and safety constraints; it employs internal state sensing that does not require an external force transducer; and, finally, it develops an impact simulation environment that can handle batch simulations. This article highlights the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of speed (a 29% decrease in average task time) and energy efficiency (a 35% decrease) through a systematic comparison between classical grabbing and impact-aware swift grabbing and tossing. In summary, our article underscores the transformative potential of impact-aware technologies in revolutionizing robotic logistics operations.

When used to control a dynamical system, these conditions are essential to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system’s trajectory. Here we propose a general method to convert a Quadratic Program (QP) into a Second-Order Cone Problem (SOCP), which is shown to be Lipschitz continuous. Key features of our approach are that (i) the regularity of the resulting formulation does not depend on the structural properties of the constraints, such as the linear independence of their gradients; and (ii) it admits a closed-form solution under some assumptions, which is not available for general QPs with multiple constraints, enabling faster computation.

By using only the relative outputs from neighboring agents, we propose a distributed dual observer-based time-varying output feedback protocol, in which the output feedback gain is designed by two time-varying terms one of which tends towards infinity as time increases, while the other tends towards zero. Compared with existing results, the proposed protocols possess two distinctive advantages. First, they eliminate the need for information exchange over the communication network, thereby providing inherent immunity to network-level attacks. Second, the protocols are fully distributed, which ensures robustness against variations in the communication topology. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocol."

    "abstract": "The min-max multiple traveling salesman problem (min-max mTSP) is a significant variant of the min-max routing problem, focusing on minimizing the longest subtour cost among multiple salesmen working cooperatively. This problem is highly relevant in real-world scenarios but is notoriously challenging, especially as the scale increases with numerous salesmen covering thousands of cities. This paper presents a novel approach for solving large-scale min-max mTSP. Our method, based on deep reinforcement learning, introduces a novel two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate an initial solution using a constructive model incorporating global and local attention mechanisms through a gated network. Additionally, we employ multi-task training on a single constructive model across various mTSP problems with differing numbers of salesmen, using weighted task balancing to balance the multi-task learning process. In the second stage, the initial solution is iteratively refined using improvement policy, which re-optimizes the current subtours to form a new better one. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first capable of handling problems with up to 10,000 nodes. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best solution on 71% of the problems in randomly uniform datasets, outperforming all existing methods.

A self-developed encircling eddy current sensor is employed to capture the electromagnetic response signals of defects. Time-frequency analysis and wavelet packet transform are utilized to extract multi-scale time-frequency features, constructing an energy distribution model of defect-sensitive frequency bands. To address noise interference and waveform distortion, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) density clustering algorithm is adopted for adaptive noise suppression and feature space optimization, establishing a mathematical model of defects based on waveform statistical characteristics. On this basis, a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed, leveraging multi-level convolutional kernels to extract the spatiotemporal correlation features, enabling accurate classification of four types of defects: cracks, fractures, surface roughness, and uneven diameter. Experimental results show that the method achieves an accuracy of 94.5% in classification on the test set and has good robustness. The study innovatively combines DBSCAN clustering with CNN classification, providing a novel approach for non-destructive testing of wire materials."

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of cloud systems, resource performance fluctuation and failure have become two significant factors that affect task execution in the cloud, particularly for workflow tasks with precedence constraints. The former often leads to uncertain task execution time, while the latter can result in task abortion. Although many cloud workflow scheduling algorithms have been proposed for fault tolerance or uncertain task execution time separately, these two issues simultaneously exist in practice and have not yet been thoroughly explored. This paper proposes a hybrid fault-tolerant cloud workflow scheduling algorithm designed to study the failures of cloud resources and uncertain task execution time simultaneously. The proposed scheduling process consists of four phases: preprocessing, initial scheduling, online scheduling, and online adjustment. Two fundamental and widely recognized strategies for fault tolerance, replication and resubmission, are integrated into the algorithm. An elastic resource provisioning mechanism is also designed to adjust active resources dynamically. Performance evaluations on both randomly generated and real-world workflows demonstrate that the algorithm effectively schedules deadline-constrained workflows under uncertain task execution time while guaranteeing fault tolerance."

    "abstract": "Silicon interposer is extensively used in 2.5D/3D electronic packaging, which has ultra-high densities of Redistribution Layers (RDLs) and Through Silicon Vias (TSVs), but the signal integrity degrades significantly due to the combined effects of high transmission loss and enhanced mutual coupling in ultra-dense interconnects. A novel annular dielectric layer (ADL) TSV structure was proposed to address the signal integrity challenges encountered in conventional silicon interposer. In ADL-TSV structure, low-k dielectric fillers are added around the signal TSVs, which may reduce the effective dielectric constant between TSVs, thereby diminishes capacitive coupling among TSVs. It also increases their characteristic impedance and signal propagation speed, while the associated risk of signal delay remains well within controllable limits. To thoroughly investigate the impact of the ADL on signal integrity, an equivalent circuit model based on RLGC parameters was established. Compared to the conventional TSV, ADL-TSV reduced the return loss (RL) by 0.75 dB, insertion loss (IL) by 0.031 dB, and far-end crosstalk (FEXT) by 4.78 dB at the signal frequency of 45 GHz. In the eye diagram, ADL-TSV is larger than conventional TSV by 0.003 V and 0.12 ps in eye height and eye width respectively. Furthermore, the performance improvement achieved by the ADL is more pronounced under small-pitch TSV configurations. The results show that the proposed ADL-TSV has obvious advantages in signal transmission quality at high-frequency, and thus can be applied to high-performance, high-reliability heterogeneous integration systems."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy, particularly wind power, introduces significant uncertainty into power system operations, posing new challenges for reliable and cost-effective dispatch. To address this, we propose a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheduling model that incorporates renewable energy uncertainty using ∞-Wasserstein ambiguity set constructed on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) augmented empirical data. This approach enhances out-of-sample performance by better capturing the distributional characteristics of renewable variability. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the infinite-dimensional nature of the DRO model, we develop an adaptive polyhedral approximation (APA) method. The APA algorithm iteratively refines scenario-specific recourse approximations, transforming the original DRO model into a tractable finite-dimensional problem while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. Case studies on the modified IEEE 14 and 118-bus test systems validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that the model achieves a desirable trade-off between economic efficiency and robustness and that the APA method reduces computation time without comprising the solution accuracy."

    "abstract": "Optimizing fuel delivery operations presents significant challenges due to stochastic demand, dynamic travel conditions, and complex operational constraints. While traditional optimization provides rigorous formulations, it becomes computationally intractable for large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and deterministic constraint validation. We first formulate a stochastic model capturing demand uncertainty and derive its deterministic equivalent using chance constraints and recourse strategies. Our solution employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) augmented with GNN-based spatial encoding to learn adaptive routing policies, while a post-decision validation mechanism ensures operational feasibility. Rigorous comparison with Gurobi 10.0.1 establishes that our approach achieves a 2.8% optimality gap on small instances where exact solutions exist, while exact methods fail to converge on medium-scale networks (16.7% MIP gap after 24h) and exhaust memory on large-scale instances. Extensive experiments on real-world fuel delivery networks from Tunisia (ranging from 10 to 100 nodes) demonstrate that our PPO-GNN framework significantly outperforms classical approaches across all scales. Compared to standard DRL, we achieve 7.2–8.5% cost reduction and 72–78% decrease in unmet demand, with constraint violations reduced by over 75%. Against traditional heuristics, improvements reach 11.7% in cost and 67% in feasibility. The framework demonstrates superior scalability, requiring only 31,400–35,200 episodes to converge compared to 42,100–46,200 for classical DRL. By bridging learning-based adaptability with optimization-based rigor, this work provides a practical and scalable solution for stochastic vehicle routing in fuel logistics and beyond."

However, this feature also poses greater challenges to its secure transmission, especially in networks with dual-identity nodes which act as legitimate users while also being able to eavesdrop on information from other users. This behavior will simultaneously weaken the security of both public and private streams. In this regard, the active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) offers a promising method by suppressing eavesdropper channels and enhancing the quality of legitimate links. Focusing on the physical layer security (PLS) challenge posed by dual-identity users in mmWave-RSMA networks, this paper proposes an active RIS assisted secure beamforming scheme integrated with resource allocation optimization. Specifically, while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for dual-identity user and power amplification constraints of the active RIS, the sum secrecy rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vector, reflection coefficient matrix, common rate allocation, and power allocation coefficients. To solve this non convex problem, we divide it into three subproblems. Then, successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) are used to solve these subproblems. Simulation results validated the critical role of active RIS in reducing eavesdropping, and emphasized the importance of joint resource allocation for secure beamforming in mmWave-RSMA."

To address that challenge, we present a comprehensive review of the literature to consolidate definitions of noise and establish a unified taxonomy, deriving a hierarchical decomposition framework of noise types, and discussing their origins. Building on this framework, we next introduce a noise injection tool, called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SNIP</i>, that enables controlled experimentation by simulating various noise scenarios in event logs, with our discussion here supported by a case study demonstrating the tool’s application.

In order to achieve the goal of \"Carbon peaking and carbon neutralization\", the development and utilization of clean renewable energy such as offshore wind energy has become a development trend. In view of the complexity of the marine environment, EPDM cable is widely used in the power transmission of offshore wind power units because of its excellent weather resistance. In this paper, UV aging, salt spray aging and temperature alternating aging are performed on EPDM samples to simulate the state changes of EPDM under ocean conditions. The electrical and mechanical properties of EPDM samples after aging are measured, and the internal aging mechanism is analyzed. Based on the experimental data, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is modified and the weight analysis at two levels is done: The first is the weight analysis of performance parameters of a single aging factor. The weight of tensile strength and elongation at break under ultraviolet aging is the highest, which is 24.06% and 21.62%. The weight of volume resistivity under salt spray aging and temperature alternating aging is the highest, which is 23.05% and 30.75%. Then the influence weights of different aging factors on EPDM samples are calculated, in which the weight of ultraviolet aging is 64.3%, salt spray aging is 28.3%, and the weight of temperature alternating aging is 7.4%. It can be seen that UV irradiation has the greatest influence on the performance of EPDM. This study has important guiding significance for the long-term reliability evaluation of the insulation state of offshore wind cables."

In the first setup, the DMC can only be used k(n) times, where k(n) grows sublinearly in the length of the observations n. In the second setup, the DMC can be used n times, however a block-input cost constraint C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</inf> is imposed and C<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</inf> grows sublinearly in n. The optimal Stein exponent coincides for both setups and depends on whether the DMC is partially-connected, i.e., one of the output symbols can only be induced by a strict subset of the input symbols, or fully-connected. For partially-connected DMCs, the optimal Stein exponent of our setups coincides with the optimal Stein exponent (identified by Han and by Shalaby and Papamarcou) for the scenario where the sensor can communicate a sublinear (in n) number of bits to the decision center and communication is over a noiseless link. In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs the optimal Stein exponent collapses and is given by the optimal Stein exponent of the local test at the decision center. In this case, the sensor and the DMC do not help in improving the Stein exponent. Our results hold for general independent and identically distributed sources."

    "abstract": "An undersampled autocorrelation-based spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal detection in channels sampled below the Nyquist rate. The proposed algorithm reduces the complexity of autocorrelation-based detection by minimizing the number of unique multiplications required to compute the autocorrelation function, exploiting the inherent structure of the OFDM signal. This enables low-bandwidth cognitive radios to effectively detect wideband signals. The novelty of this work lies in a threshold design approach, which compensates for the performance loss due to undersampling and maintains reliable detection accuracy. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm attains reasonable detection performance in the mid to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios, while also significantly reducing the false alarm probability under low SNR conditions."

    "abstract": "Smart environments frequently experience fluctuations in demand, infrastructure usage, and service-level expectations, requiring adaptive systems capable of dynamic selfoptimization. This work proposes a self-adaptive framework that integrates real-time monitoring, anomaly prediction, and reinforcement learning (RL) to proactively reconfigure systems before degradation occurs. Unlike previous approaches limited to specific layers or metrics, the proposed solution supports diverse performance indicators-ranging from hardware and software to network and SLA levels-and offers an extended repertoire of adaptation actions, such as resource scaling, node restarts, and heuristic tuning. Its design leverages predictive alerts to reduce reaction delays and improve adaptation timing. Experimental validation demonstrated a mean adaptation time of 0.05 seconds, approximately $94 \\%$ adaptation accuracy, $4 \\%$ overhead, and $98 \\%$ operational stability, confirming its effectiveness for real-time optimization in heterogeneous and dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) images offer unique perspectives for underwater inspection, but their low resolution and speckles make Deep Learning detectors prone to high confidence errors whenever unfamiliar objects appear. To tackle this issue, we present a lightweight trustworthiness add-on for YOLObased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). Each detected crop is analyzed by a class-specific Variational Autoencoder, and its Mean Squared reconstruction Error (MSE)-based loss is evaluated only on echo-bearing pixels. Consecutively, fitting a Gaussian Kernel-Density Estimate (KDE) to reference losses allows to produce a percentile-normalised Similarity Score that quantifies how typical a crop is for its predicted class. Experiments on the public Marine-Debris dataset show a clear separation between In-Distribution (ID) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) loss densities thanks to our add-on, mirrored by the score reported in the accompanying tables. The method is training-data efficient (requires no OOD examples), computationally inexpensive, and potentially deployable on embedded hardware, making it a practical step toward reducing False Positive detections in FLS imagery, thus increasing trustworthiness in maritime ATR systems."

This study aims to mitigate damage caused by peak and intense instantaneous impact loads during high-speed water entry. A Cushioning structure incorporating rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) was designed to absorb impact forces and enhance shell deformation resistance. Initially, the mechanical properties and constitutive parameters of RPUF were determined through dynamic and static compression tests. Subsequently, numerical simulations were employed to investigate the failure modes and energy absorption characteristics of the Cushioning structure at various water entry angles, along with the deformation behavior of the vehicle's shell structure. The findings indicate that the Cushioning structure effectively reduces peak loads upon water entry. In non-vertical water entry scenarios, the deformation and failure modes of the Cushioning structure vary: when the water entry angle is less than 45 degrees, the Cushioning structure can fully detach from the vehicle; whereas, when the water entry angle is below 30 degrees, the vehicle experiences a tail slap phenomenon, influencing its water entry trajectory. Moreover, as the water entry angle decreases, the inward indentation deformation of the vehicle hull."

The attitude quaternion is solved by fusing the star vectors of the effective optical head, with the increase of the number of measurement star vectors, the algorithm complexity increases greatly. This paper proposed a data fusion algorithm for multi-head star sensors based on the covariance of measurement star vectors to reduce the calculation of the algorithm. The observation star vectors covariance and attitude quaternion of the optical head are used to calculate the fusion attitude quaternion, and the observation star vectors covariance of each optical head is calculated in parallel. The star vector covariance determines the weight of optical head measurement information in data fusion. Through simulation analysis of outfield experiment data and on-orbit verification, the fusion attitude accuracy of the proposed algorithm is equivalent to that of the star vector fusion algorithm, and the computational cost is reduced by more than 60%."

We explored multiple ensemble configurations (3, 5, 7, and 9 bags) to identify optimal performance settings. Results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer ensemble with five bags achieved the highest accuracy (92.36%) and AUC (91.36%) on the DDSM mammography dataset.

In this paper, we propose an Edge-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (EE-GAT) model for fault detection in a dynamic UAV formation. The proposed method integrates node-level features such as altitude, velocity, battery level, with edge-level network proximity measures (RSSI and SINR) into an attention-based graph learning framework to enable accurate detection of UAV position status in a leader-follower topology. Through extensive simulations in NS3 v3.42, we demonstrate that our EE-GAT achieves a high fault detection accuracy of up to $\\mathbf{9 6. 1 \\%}$. Our approach outperforms baseline models, offering a lightweight, and cost-effective solution for real-time UAV health monitoring in dynamic and large-scale formations."

This study presents the results of a modified version of XBeach, developed at the University of Messina, which focuses on simulating plastic transport in the nearshore zone, driven by wave action. The main advantage of this model over empirical approaches is its ability not only to simulate plastic debris dynamics but also to account for the interactions with hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes. Validation against experimental data demonstrates that the numerical approach can offer improved accuracy compared to empirical models currently available in the literature."

Namely, we give an explicit capacity formula for the lossy bosonic channel subject to semi-classical attacks, where an adversary injects semi-classical states into the transmission line.

However, there are still several open issues in understanding the Quality of Experience (QoE) and visual attention of end users while experiencing 6DoF volumetric videos. For instance, the quality impact of compressing DPCs, which requires a significant amount of both time and computational resources, needs further investigation. Also, QoE prediction models for DPCs in 6DoF have rarely been developed due to the lack of visual quality databases. Furthermore, visual attention in 6DoF is hardly explored, which impedes research into more sophisticated approaches for adaptive streaming of DPCs.

This study aims to develop and evaluate a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates contrastive learning and attention mechanisms for improved feature representations and task-specific performance. We propose the convolution attention (CA) Y-Net, a dual-branch CNN architecture with separate classification and segmentation branches decoding features from a shared encoder. Lesion type is predicted from a global representation that captures salient lesion features, the generation of which in the classification branch is guided by convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) to enhance focus on the most informative regions. CBAMs are also applied to highlight encoder features, which are then passed to the segmentation decoder via skip connections. The segmentation decoder is further enhanced with deep supervision at multiple decoding stages. To jointly optimize both tasks, we introduce a multi-task contrastive (MuCo) loss, which contrasts lesion and background representations. In addition to pixel-level contrast in the segmentation encoder, MuCo loss introduces a novel cross-branch component that contrasts the global lesion representation from the classification branch with local background representations from the segmentation branch. The model was evaluated on the ISIC 2017 challenge dataset. Both the MuCo loss and CBAMs independently improved classification and segmentation performance, with deep supervision further enhancing segmentation. CA Y-Net achieved the highest mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for melanoma and seborrheic keratosis classification (92.8%) and the highest Jaccard Index for lesion segmentation (79.6%) among the state-of-the-art methods compared. The high performance afforded by CA Y-Net could potentially enable more accurate diagnosis and quantitative monitoring of skin lesions in clinical applications."

Current methods often fall short in ensuring robust performance under these conditions, highlighting a gap in the literature for adaptive control strategies that guarantee predefined-time convergence of tracking errors. In this study, we propose a predefined-time adaptive control scheme that combines a Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) law with a trajectory control law specifically designed for coaxial compound helicopters. The MRAC law incorporates explicit stability conditions to achieve predefined-time convergence of the tracking error, even under saturated input conditions. To enhance maneuverability, we develop a trajectory control law based on sliding mode control, which, when integrated with the MRAC law, ensures effective longitudinal and lateral-directional control of the helicopter. The efficacy of this combined control scheme is validated through comparative simulations using a benchmark linear angular rate system under various scenarios, and further evaluated against representative maneuvers from the ADS-33E specification. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme effectively addresses the challenges of perturbations and input saturation, offering superior predefined-time convergence and enhanced maneuverability for coaxial compound helicopters."

Second, a corresponding compensation error variable is established through the eigenvalue decomposition principle to address the unfavorable effect of the regression vector on the estimator.

    "abstract": "Satellite microwave remote sensing is acknowledged as the primary method for obtaining global-scale surface soil moisture (SSM) data. Typically, spaceborne microwave sensors aboard polar-orbiting satellites yield SSM estimates with a native spatial resolution of several tens of kilometers and a temporal resolution of about once or twice daily. This indicates considerable potential for enhancing both of their spatial and temporal resolutions. Although spatial downscaling of spaceborne microwave SSM has garnered significant attention recently, the enhancement of their temporal resolution has received less focus. This study pioneers a methodology for generating hourly-scale satellite SSM estimates. The developed approach integrates a novel blending module that combines geostationary satellite observations with a spatially downscaled SSM dataset derived from traditional fusion among microwave and optical observations on polar-orbiting platforms. This blending module leverages land surface temperature (LST) data from geostationary satellites, which effectively quantify SSM variations on an hourly interval upon the thermal inertia theory. Consequently, a comprehensive spatio-temporal integrated framework for SSM downscaling is established to produce hourly-scale SSM at a resolution of 6 km, enhancing upon the daily and 36-km resolutions of existing microwave SSM datasets. Validation of the downscaled hourly SSM estimates was conducted through an established ground soil moisture observatory network in North China, revealing an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of no higher than 0.04 cm³/cm³. This result confirms preservation of the fundamental accuracy of original microwave SSM retrievals and demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed framework in improving both spatial and temporal representativeness of SSM data."

    "abstract": "Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to “partial feature overfitting,” and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel ”Crop-Smoothing” technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations-including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on designing new motors with high torque density, which is crucial for applications ranging from electric vehicles to robotics. It proposes a double-teeth C-core switched reluctance motor with hybrid excitation, integrating permanent magnets and a novel drive technique to enhance motor torque density. It also explores three magnet placement configurations to maximize torque. A common challenge with most self-starting methods used in two-phase SRMs is the generation of negative torque, which reduces the motor's torque density. The adopted self-starting method minimizes negative torque and introduces a new drive strategy to control the switching on and off, effectively eliminating negative torque. Additionally, magnetic equivalent circuits are developed for the analytical design and theoretical analysis of all configurations. The SRMs under study are prototyped and tested, and their performances are evaluated in terms of torque-angle characteristics, current, and voltage. Both experimental and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the PM-assisted SRMs in enhancing torque density and efficiency."

Traditional cryptographic methods such as Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) or Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) impose heavy computational overheads, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained IoT environments. To address these issues, we propose a novel lightweight authentication protocol leveraging Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), utilizing smart-phones as intermediaries to facilitate secure communication with a trusted server. Our scheme avoids the overhead of maintaining large Challenge-Response Pair (CRP) databases and eliminates complex operations like Elliptic Curve cryptography and digital certificates (X.509). Experiments on an ESP32-based testbed demonstrate significant efficiency improvements over existing protocols, confirming the practicality of our lightweight approach for resource-constrained IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Recently, various Mobile Network Aggregators (MNAs) have emerged, leveraging the coverage of a few base operators to offer global connectivity. These MNAs reap the benefits of network softwarization and virtualization, such as eSIM technology or control/data-plane separation. This paper explores a new type of MNA — a thick MNA — that uses multiple base operators from different regions to provide eSIM profiles and employs public internet gateways outside the base operators' home countries. Specifically, we analyze Airalo, a thick MNA operating in 219 countries. Unlike other MNAs that our community has scrutinized, we show that Airalo often decouples the geographical location of the public internet gateway from the native country of the base operator via IPX Hub Breakout (IHBO). To map Airalo's underlying infrastructure, we ran web-based measurements that 14 volunteers performed while traveling and using an Airalo eSIM on their personal devices. We further dive into Airalo's performance by running device-based measurements (speedtest, traceroute, etc.) in 10 countries. We find that IHBO, despite offering some latency benefits over traditional Home-Routed Roaming, still results in inflated latency and degraded bandwidth compared to non-roaming traffic, introducing new challenges for user experience, content access, and privacy."

Specifically, in this problem, there are three legitimate parties: Alice, Bob and Charlie. The goal is to allow Charlie to generate a secret key with Alice and another secret key with Bob, reliably, secretly and covertly. Reliability ensures that the key generated by Alice and Charlie is the same and the key generated by Bob and Charlie is the same. Secrecy ensures that the secret keys generated are only known to specific legitimate parties. Covertness ensures that the key generation process is undetectable by a warden Willie. As a corollary of our result, we establish bounds on the capacity region of wiretap secret key generation without the covertness constraint and discuss the impact of covertness. Our results generalize the point-to-point result of Tahmasbi and Bloch (TIFS 2020) to the setting of multiterminal communication."

    "abstract": "Electronically controlled solid propellant (ECSP), a chemically reactive material regulated by electrical currents, achieves controlled ignition and flameout through threshold-exceeding current application. Upon electrical stimulation, ECSP undergoes decomposition and combustion, generating thermal energy that sustains propellant burning and thrust production. The system's capability for cyclic start-up/shutdown operations confers structural simplicity and precise thrust regulation upon engines, thereby enhancing both maneuverability and control accuracy in solid propulsion systems. While ECSP demonstrates significant developmental potential, its ignition and combustion mechanisms involve intricate electrochemical processes that differ fundamentally from conventional solid propellants. In this experimental investigation, we systematically examined electrode parameter influences on ECSP ignition dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that mesh electrode configurations promote enhanced ECSP combustion. Crucially, electrode material composition and polarity distribution were identified as critical determinants of ignition characteristics. Based on these observations, we developed a mechanistic framework elucidating electrode-mediated ignition processes and formulated a corresponding ignition model. This study contributes novel empirical data and physical interpretations to advance both fundamental research and engineering implementations of electronically controlled solid propellant technologies."

This study evaluated the growth performance and biomass yield of the ascidians Phallusia mammillata (Cuvier, 1815) and Styela plicata (Lesueur, 1823) cultured in a Mediterranean IMTA system using natural fiber ropes as settlement substrates. Ropes were deployed in November 2022, and monitoring occurred monthly from May to October 2023.

Phallusia mammillata exhibited consistent growth, reaching 9.34 $\\pm 1.34 \\mathrm{~cm}$ in October with an average increase of $1.27 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{month}$. Styela plicata showed higher recruitment rates and densities peaking in June at $686 \\pm 87$ individuals per rope, with a growth rate of $0.79 \\mathrm{~cm} /$ month. Through allometric relationships, live weight was derived to estimate ascidian biomass production. Maximum biomass per rope reached $0.60 \\pm 0.16 \\mathrm{~kg}$ for P. mammillata and $1.32 \\pm 0.21 \\mathrm{~kg}$ for S. plicata over 4-6 months of cultivation, corresponding approximately to 400 kg of ascidians at the IMTA facility scale ($118 \\pm 33 \\mathrm{~kg}$ for P. mammillata and $259 \\pm 42 \\mathrm{~kg}$ for S. plicata).

Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state."

    "abstract": "The rapid recovery of reliable communication networks in disaster areas is crucial for effective emergency response. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with free-space optical (FSO) communication systems offer a flexible and rapid solution to restore connectivity when traditional infrastructure is compromised. However, the performance of FSO systems is highly susceptible to environmental factors such as fog, rain, and turbulence, which can degrade signal quality. This paper proposes a machine learning-based system to improve the deployment and operation of UAV-based FSO networks in disaster scenarios. The method uses predictive modeling to anticipate atmospheric conditions, optimizes UAV positioning to maximize communication reliability, and integrates anomaly detection to maintain network resilience. The proposed ML-FSO model simultaneously addresses regression (signal prediction using RMSE and $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$) and classification (signal quality assessment using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy). Despite the relatively small dataset (100 samples), extensive cross-validation, simulations, and proposed real-world tests demonstrate the system’s ability to improve communication reliability and resilience in dynamic and challenging environments. The results show that the ensemble model (MLFSO) significantly outperforms conventional approaches, making it a promising tool for enhancing communication networks in disaster situations. To our knowledge, this is the first integrated approach combining predictive ML, trajectory optimization, and anomaly detection for UAV-FSO disaster communication."

This work intends to present the numerical study concerning the interactional phenomena between an iced propeller and a clean wing of an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in forward flight phase. The investigations are conducted at two icing temperatures, -5°C and -15°C, employing FE SNAP-ICE software to perform icing simulations and ANSYS CFX for aerodynamic interactional analysis. The findings demonstrate that turbulent and dispersed flow following an iced propeller intensified the aerodynamic interaction between the propeller and wing, leading to significant effects on the wing's aerodynamic performance, which is greatly linked to the ice structures. The results indicate 12% decrease in the lift to drag ratio of wing at icing temperature of -15°C, an increase in wing sectional suction peak of about 18% and increase in turbulence intensity of about 229% than clean propeller in the wake region. Demonstrating that overall impact of ice accumulation on UAVs exceeds than those observed for the isolated propeller and wing, highlighting an urgent necessity for ice mitigation techniques."

Leveraging a large dataset of numerical wave simulations and in-situ observations, we develop a two-step approach: first, a classification model discriminates between locally generated windsea and remotely generated swell conditions; second, separate regression models are trained for each wave type to predict the peak wave period. The models are implemented using Random Forests and incorporate spatial and temporal features to enhance accuracy. Results show high predictive performance, with mean absolute errors around 0.3 seconds and coefficients of determination exceeding 0.93 in test sets.

    "abstract": "The mechanical characteristics of cavitation collapse during the water-exiting process of trans-media vehicles critically influence structural integrity and operational safety. This study employs an integrated experimental approach using a multifunctional decompression water tank device coupled with high-speed imaging and a multi-parameter synchronous measurement system to investigate the dynamic behavior of cavitation collapse during underwater vehicle launch. We systematically reveal the evolution of the flow field, vehicle motion characteristics, pressure fluctuations, and underlying dynamic mechanisms throughout the collapse process. Experimental results demonstrate that cavitation collapse evolves through six distinct phases: Head contact, Progressive collapse, Synchronous collapse, Jet rebound, Secondary collapse, and Cascade collapse. The collapse process is governed by two principal pressure mechanisms: shock waves from liquid layers adhering to the vehicle surface during water-air interface crossing and pressure pulses from instantaneous gas compression. Axial propagation of collapse-induced pressure waves exhibits exponential attenuation in peak pressure, with the core collapse region concentrated below O.214L. Spatial analysis of pressure fields reveals significant localization of high-frequency signals and long-range persistence of low-frequency components, reflecting both local dynamics and global volume oscillations. Crucially, peak pressure intensity increases markedly with decreasing cavitation numbers, where low-cavitation conditions trigger high-frequency oscillations and asymmetric collapse behavior. These findings provide a quantified model for collapse energy dissipation and establish a foundation for predicting hydrodynamic loads during trans-media operations."

This includes images related to national defense and security, such as military equipment or images of military bases, as well as images in civilian life that involve equipment containing critical technological secrets of many enterprises. Therefore, securing image data in practice is of great importance. Encrypting image data based on the AES block cipher is a widely considered approach, as there have been no publicly known successful attacks that break AES to date. However, many potential attacks against AES exist, and to enhance its security, researchers have focused on dynamically modifying its internal transformations. Various studies have explored dynamic substitution layers, diffusion layers, and key addition layers. Nevertheless, no research so far has proposed a method that dynamically modifies all four transformations within AES rounds. In this paper, we propose a method to dynamically change all four component transformations of AES to enhance the security of the cipher. We then apply the dynamic AES block cipher to the encryption and protection of image data."

In this paper, we focus on the smoothness of Huffman coding and its variations through the concept of codeword smoothness, which is the number of codewords that change in the code as a result of a small change. We show that the standard Huffman algorithm is highly volatile, as a single change in source data can change a large fraction of the codewords, causing large changes in the compressed data. We propose the use of Canonical Huffman Encoding for improved smoothness and show that it can significantly outperform the standard version. We also propose a new variant, Pre-allocated Huffman Coding and show that it has better smoothness compared to the canonical algorithm. In addition to our theoretical results, we perform simulations, confirming our theoretical finding."

In this context, the use of bioindicators is crucial to monitor the health of marine coastal ecosystems. Alteration of marine organisms behaviour is useful to provide insights into pollution levels, representing an environmental early warning. However, detecting and quantifying behavioural responses presents critical issues, - i.e. time consuming, operator-dependent – that affect data accuracy and reliability. To address these challenges, the present study focuses on the development of an AI-based technology, able to detect behavioural responses in marine invertebrates for an automatic environmental monitoring. Specifically, the AI-based technology has been validated towards crustaceans (barnacles) behavioural responses, namely valves opening. Preliminary results on barnacle valves opening frequency and active organisms percentage were obtained through in laboratory and in field considering the influence of different parameters (i.e. temperature, food source, suspended organic matter) on this behavioural alteration. Data obtained through the AI-based technology have been validated by manual detection. Results confirm the accuracy, efficiency and reliability of behavioural responses of marine crustaceans under different environmental scenarios, promoting its use as an early warning tool for assessing marine environmental health also by using an AI-based technology."

Conversely, we demonstrate that unachievable overflow thresholds are characterized by smooth min entropy. We extend the achievable threshold results to the asymptotic case, proving convergence to the smooth max entropy rate. Our work establishes a direct connection between overflow probability bounds and smooth Rényi entropy, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing variable-length codes under cost constraints."

This paper presents an autonomous underwater monitoring pipeline that integrates computer vision and navigation technologies onboard the FeelHippo AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). The proposed system leverages a DeepLabV3+ CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for semantic segmentation of underwater images, enabling autonomous detection of Po. 3D maps of the sea bottom are obtained through stereo vision, supported by a ZED2 stereo camera encased in a flat-port housing. By fusing segmentation outputs with spatial data from onboard navigation systems and the stereo camera images, the approach yields geo-referenced point clouds that differentiate seagrass from non-seagrass areas. Preliminary field experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea validate the method’s feasibility and highlight its potential for scalable, efficient, and autonomous marine habitat mapping. Future improvements aim to refine localization accuracy and further hone robustness of the proposed workflow."

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines."

Our implementation leverages OmniBuds—a pair of true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds equipped with dual 9-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs), optical heart rate sensors, and skin temperature sensors, one set in each ear. These sensors continuously stream motion and physiological data via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a mobile computing platform, where lightweight inference models classify user actions and assess physiological states. Based on this analysis, the system provides real-time auditory feedback through the same earbuds, enabling responsive, human-in-the-loop interaction. As a demonstration, we apply this system to an interactive control scenario based on the T-Rex Chrome Dino game, where users control the avatar using head and body motion captured by the earbuds. Jumping and ducking are recognized in real time through IMU signals, while heart rate and skin temperature dynamically modulates the game speed. The system delivers auditory guidance via the OmniBuds' speakers to help users adapt their actions during game-play. This framework demonstrates the potential of multimodal wearable sensing and closed-loop feedback for embodied interaction, real-time behavioral adaptation, and health-aware interactive systems."

To address this limitation, we propose Multivariate-Imaged Diffusion (MIDiff), which encodes multivariate mobile-usage and user trajectories data as phase relationships and transforms them into two-dimensional images. By adapting the Gramian Angular Summation Field into a cross-relation computation, MIDiff highlights sparse but important data points as salient image features for diffusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MIDiff achieves higher similarity to real data and reduces temporal consistency error by 72% compared to TTS-GAN."

In this paper, we explore how the 2024 Summer Olympics hosted by Paris, France conditioned local mobile data traffic volumes and dynamics. We do so from a privileged vantage point by analyzing measurements collected in Orange's production network, largest mobile operator in the country and the official communications partner to the event organization. Our results shed light on a variety of aspects, including how Olympic Games affect consumption of mobile services, the burden that the event imposes on the local mobile network infrastructure, and how operators prepare for it."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of cloud computing and its integration with the edge to fulfil the demands of modern Internet of Things (IoT) applications is significantly driving economic growth and technological innovation. However, the environmental impact of energy-intensive cloud computing is becoming increasingly critical, particularly with the rise of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Net0AICloud (NetZeroAICloud), an AI-driven framework designed to optimise resource management and energy consumption while maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) and minimising carbon emissions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. The Net0AICloud framework, which applies Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) for the cloud scheduler and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer (FT-Transformer) for a disease prediction case study, achieves 8.01% and 2.99% improvements in predictive accuracy over baseline Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models, respectively. This demonstrates the potential to significantly improve resource utilisation and reduce energy consumption while maintaining robust service quality for AIoT applications, highlighting actionable recommendations to achieve net zero targets in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter is an attractive topology to interface energy sources, such as battery energy storage or photovoltaic systems, with the medium-voltage grid. The submodules in CHB converter-based energy systems unavoidably process different active power during operation. However, there exist inherent limits that prohibit an arbitrarily imbalanced intra-phase active power distribution. Failing to consider such limits can result in output current distortion and capacitor voltage deviation, which can jeopardize the CHB converter. Crucially, these limits vary depending on the modulation method utilized, whose selection is, thus, of utmost relevance. Accordingly, this paper derives and compares the feasible intra-phase active power imbalance range of existing modulation methods. The analysis is experimentally corroborated in a 1-kVA single-phase CHB converter with six submodules per phase. Based on the comparison, suggestions on which modulation methods are preferred for different CHB applications are provided."

However, conventional approaches, mainly utilizing graph attention networks, often regard trust interactions as static and neglect their dynamic nature. Such a limitation undermines the precision of modeling trust dynamics and obstructs the comprehension of how trust evolves within online social networks. To address this challenge, we propose TrustFormer, a novel collaborative approach that integrates time-dependent trust interactions and explicitly predicts dynamic trust relationships. Specifically, TrustFormer first embeds an evolving topology from trust interactions to capture latent temporal features. It then applies time encoding within a multi-head attention network, quantifying the significance of time-sensitive topological features. Further, TrustFormer employs bidirectional interaction transferring to formalize shared trust topological features. Finally, pairwise trust relationships are evaluated using these topological features. Supported by extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in trust dynamics modeling, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy."

Within a unified framework, a comparative study was conducted on the interval matrix method and the maximum absolute value method with respect to the state-dependent switching parameters induced by memristive characteristics. Correspondingly, two different controllers are designed, with theorem constraints expressed algebraically and as LMIs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, under identical initial system parameters, the interval matrix method constructs a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) incorporating an integral term, enabling finer handling of time-delay effects. As a result, it provides a more accurate estimate of the upper bound of the settling time (ST) compared to the maximum absolute value method, thereby achieving faster and more efficient synchronization control. Ultimately, the proposed results are applied to image encryption, thereby demonstrating its theoretical significance and practical utility."

These characteristics have led to its increasing application in human activity recognition, with promising use cases in smart homes, healthcare monitoring, and security systems. However, during radar data acquisition, substantial background interference and noise can significantly reduce recognition accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a human action recognition method that integrates a deep convolutional autoencoder with a multi-scale attention mechanism. In the preprocessing stage, phase mean subtraction and moving average filtering are applied to suppress static background clutter in the radar micro-Doppler features. Subsequently, feature denoising and enhancement are performed using a convolutional autoencoder and attention modules to improve focus on motion-relevant regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves over 96% accuracy on both a self-constructed dataset and a public benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the model maintains high recognition performance under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, confirming its robustness and effectiveness in complex environments."

To promote population diversity and search efficiency, three distinct initialization strategies are employed. During the evolutionary process, adaptive neighborhood selection strategy is integrated to enhance solution refinement. Furthermore, a customized energy saving operator is introduced to minimize redundant energy consumption. To comprehensively assess its performance, KDMA is tested on 54 instances that span various different combinations of jobs, machines, factories, and products. Comparative experiments with multiple state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that KDMA achieves superior performance in both solution quality and computational stability."

    "abstract": "Robotaxis are emerging as a key component of urban transportation. However, most current robotaxis rely on preset pick-up points, which cluster robotaxi activity and intensify local traffic congestion, increase deadheading and detour distances, extend roadway occupancy, and raise operating costs. GNSS-based localization may be unreliable especially in urban area. Generally, human drivers can communicate with passengers through text/voice interactions to accurately locate and reach the human’s location. How to align the robotaxi’s visual recognition results with human text/voice description is the key challenge. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive framework, including its architecture, requirment, opertional logic, workflow, to enhance the passenger-robotaxi interaction for accurate passenger pick-up without preset pick-up points. In this framework, the key algorithm is VLMIdentification, a realtime human identification model based on LVLM. VLMIdentification comprises three modules: i) Human Input Processing, which extracts textual features from passenger text/voice and converts human-centric descriptions into third-person, robotaxi-centric attributes; ii)Candidate Searching, which couples conventional detectors with an LVLM to adapt detection thresholds to scene complexity and to translate detections into textual descriptors; and iii) Human Identification, which performs matching between the processed passenger description and candidates to locate the correct human. We defined the human identification with multimodal task, proposed evaluation metrics, and built a new HID (Human Identification with Description) dataset based on existing autonomous driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that VLMIdentification outperforms baseline in comprehensive metrics and retains robust, performance under adverse environment and cross-scenario generalization tests, thereby confirming its generalization and robustness.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of a STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system under channel aging, which has been ignored in previous studies. Firstly, we propose a linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) aggregated channel estimator and formulate statistical channel state information (CSI) properties for the subsequent system performance analyses. Then, closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink spectral efficiencies (SEs) of the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system under channel aging are explored, where for the uplink, the two-layer large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) and the simple centralized decoding (SCD) are utilized, respectively, and for the downlink, the maximal ratio (MR) precoding and fractional power control (FPC) are adopted. Moreover, the optimal LSFD coefficients that maximize the uplink SE is presented. Afterwards, for further enhancement of SEs, a novel optimization scheme is presented, which optimizes the passive beamforming (PB) of the STAR-RIS to minimize the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the aggregated channel estimation. The simulation results reveal that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system achieves superior uplink and downlink performance compared to both the RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system and the conventional CF-mMIMO system without RIS over aging channel. Furthermore, the results show that the PB optimization can significantly reduce the NMSE of channel estimation, thereby improving the estimation accuracy and SEs under channel aging."

However, existing methods typically rely on transformer-based architectures, which often face challenges related to scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose InterMamba, a novel and efficient human–human interaction generation method built on the Mamba framework, designed to capture long-sequence dependencies effectively while enabling real-time feedback. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba framework that utilizes two parallel SSM branches with an adaptive mechanism to integrate the spatial and temporal features of motion sequences. To further enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies within individual motion sequences and the interactions between different individual sequences, we develop two key modules: the self adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module and the cross adaptive spatio-temporal Mamba module, enabling efficient feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on both two interaction datasets with remarkable quality and efficiency. Compared to the baseline method InterGen, our approach not only improves accuracy but also reduces the parameter size to just 66 M (36% of InterGen's), while achieving an average inference speed of 0.57 seconds, which is 46% of InterGen's execution time."

To address this problem, a UIM was proposed for the3ph-DAB converter to extend the zero voltages witching (ZVS) range and reduce the overall power loss under light load condition. First, a theoretical analysis of UIM, including transmission power and ZVS characteristics, was presented. The implementation and validation through 150-V1 kW 3ph-DAB converter experimental prototype shows that the UIM strategy effectively elevates light load power efficiency when the output power is lower than 0.16 per unit (p.u.) and achieves a maximum efficiency improvement of 12.7%."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity and immutable nature of smart contracts (SC) present significant challenges for blockchain security, as vulnerabilities can lead to major financial losses and systemic risks. Existing fuzzing solutions remain fragmented: tools specializing in cross-contract analysis often perform poorly on single-contract scenarios, while contract-focused tools lack robustness for interconnected protocols. Most prior fuzzers also depend on shallow heuristics or fixed mutation logic, hindering their adaptability and effectiveness across diverse contract systems. We introduce UniFuzz, a unified framework that integrates multilayer static and semantic analysis, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leveraging audit-driven knowledge, and orchestrated multi-agent collaboration. UniFuzz employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for deep semantic analysis and targeted test input generation, guided by insights from real-world audit reports and coordinated through specialized agents. This design enables UniFuzz to bridge the gap between single-contract and cross-contract testing and adapt dynamically to varied SC structures and deployment patterns. Extensive evaluations using standard benchmarks and production-scale contract datasets demonstrate that UniFuzz consistently delivers high code coverage and identifies a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities. Notably, UniFuzz achieves up to 90.99% code coverage and outperforms state-of-the-art tools by up to 6.6 percentage points in branch coverage. These results position UniFuzz as an advanced, practical solution for automated SC security validation, paving the way for more resilient blockchain ecosystems."

In this paper, we focus on repairing multiple node failures and construct binary cooperative MSR codes with optimal access bandwidth. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of the codes by designing the parity-check matrices over a special polynomial ring ${\\mathcal{R}} = {{\\mathbb{F}}_2}[x]/\\left({1 + x + \\cdots + {x^{p - 1}}}\\right)$ where p is a prime. The obtained codes with length n and dimension k achieve the lower bound on repair bandwidth under cooperative repair model with optimal access property for any 2 ≤ h ≤ r and k+1 ≤ d ≤ n – h where h and d are the number of failure nodes and helper nodes, respectively. Moreover, the computation operations involved in encoding, decoding and nodes repair are only exclusive ORs and cyclic shifts, resulting in less CPU overhead compared with the complex multiplication operations over finite fields."

Unlike methods that add explicit noise to the estimated empirical distribution, ROO achieves ϵ-differential privacy by randomly choosing whether to \"reveal\" or \"obscure\" the empirical distribution. While ROO is structurally identical to the algorithm in a recent work by Cheu and Nayak, we prove a strictly better bound on the sampling complexity than that established by them. To further improve the privacy-utility tradeoff, we propose a novel generalized sampling algorithm called Data-Specific ROO (DS-ROO), where the probability of obscuring the empirical distribution of the dataset is chosen adaptively. We prove that DS-ROO satisfies ϵ-DP, and provide empirical evidence that DS-ROO can achieve better utility under the same privacy budget of vanilla ROO."

    "abstract": "The problem of network function computation over a directed acyclic network is investigated in this paper. In such a network, a sink node desires to compute with zero error a target function, of which the inputs are generated at multiple source nodes. Existing research on network function computation explores two types of problems regarding block-length network codes and variable-length network codes. In this paper, we concentrate on an important class of variable-length network codes, namely uniquely-decodable network codes, whose computing rate is the maximum average expected number of bits transmitted on all edges in the network for computing the target function once with zero error. In the existing papers, lower bounds on the computing capacity of uniquely-decodable network codes have been proposed under certain constraints on either the network topology or the target function. By developing a novel graph coloring approach based on a cut-set strong partition, we obtain a general lower bound on the computing capacity of uniquely-decodable network codes, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies, arbitrary information sources and arbitrary target functions. Furthermore, we show that this lower bound is a strict improvement over the previous results by applying this lower bound to the problem of computing an arithmetic sum over a diamond network."

Then, the users transmit simultaneously and arrive at the base station (BS) receiver with different delays, i.e., without user-synchronization. The BS receiver carries out an over-sampling-based operation, yielding an over-sampled signal space. We develop an iterative soft cancellation detection and decoding that exploits the interference structure of the over-sampled signal for powerful multi-user decoding. Afterwards, packet cancellation for a-RSA is utilized to solve packet collision. To characterize the performance of a-RSA, we analyze the achievable channel parameter region (ACPR) and outage probability. Further, we present an asymptotic analysis of the throughput of a-RSA system. It is demonstrated that the normalized throughput of a-RSA exceeds that of traditional RSA by about 20% ~ 30%."

Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance."

The closed-form expressions of the average AoI in both cases are obtained. Moreover, we prove that when fixing the mean of S, deterministic service time minimizes the system average AoI if packet service cannot be preempted.

This paper introduces a novel method for configuring model density grouping (MDG) to optimize model selection, signaling efficiency, and collaborative learning performance. By leveraging the density of similar models across UEs with model identification, our approach enhances the adaptability and convergence of ML operations via system information and dedicated radio protocol signaling. Our analysis shows dynamic grouping, density estimation, and signaling procedures that allow intelligent selection and activation of model sets with minimal accuracy tradeoffs and signaling overhead. Evaluation demonstrates the utility of MDGs in improving convergence efficiency and scalability in one/two-sided model environments."

The study simulates five acoustic sources in a multipath environment and analyzes received signals at two different array geometries with eight hydrophone elements. To enhance source localization, study employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on received time-domain signals. The CNN model achieves an average DoA estimation accuracy of 2.5° RMSE with circular arrays and 4.2° RMSE with linear arrays across all sources. The model was tested under varying signal-tonoise ratios (SNRs) from 0 dB to 20 dB. At 10 dB SNR, the circular array maintained $90 \\%$ accuracy (within ± 5°), while the linear array dropped to $76 \\%$ accuracy, demonstrating higher robustness of the circular configuration in noisy environments. In terms of angular resolution, the circular array resolved sources separated by as little as 8°, compared to 12° for the linear array. However, the linear array required $25 \\%$ less training time and approximately $30 \\%$ lower computational cost during inference due to its simpler geometry and reduced spatial diversity."

To address this limitation, we propose an unsupervised learning framework based on KMeans clustering to classify estuarine branches with similar physical and hydrodynamic behavior. Using environmental and hydrodynamic data from 14 branches across four major European rivers-Po, Danube, Ebro, and Rhône-we identify distinct estuarine typologies shaped by key drivers such as salinity and river discharge. To explore the potential of these groupings, we performed intra-cluster regression modeling. Employing Random Forest and Least-Squares Boosting algorithms, we aim to predict key indicators of estuarine dynamics, including salt wedge intrusion length, salt flux, and heat flux at the estuary mouth. Initial findings suggest that clustering may help to improve predictive performance by reducing variability and enhancing model focus, offering a promising direction for developing more transferable and scalable modeling frameworks."

Specifically, S can transmit simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) to R with the time switching (TS) protocol. Then, R uses the collected energy to decode the received signal and forwards it to D using the decode-and-forward (DF) technique, and this signal is also received by E.

This distortion, integral to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, effectively defines the similarity in spaces of possibly different dimensions even without a direct metric between them. While the RDD function qualifies as an informational RD function, encoding theorems substantiate its status as an operational RD function, thereby underscoring its potential applicability in real-world source coding. Due to the high computational complexity associated with Gromov-type distortion, in general, the RDD function cannot be evaluated analytically. Consequently, we develop an alternating mirror descent algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity by employing decomposition, linearization, and relaxation techniques. Numerical results on classical sources and different grids demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. By exploring the relationship between the RDD function and the RD function, we suggest that the RDD function may have potential applications in future scenarios."

To address the difficulty of identifying minor faults and transitional states in UAV motors during actual operations, this paper proposes an intelligent multicondition fault diagnosis method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM). Four typical operating conditions (normal, slight fault, transitional state, and severe fault) are simulated to construct sample datasets. Sixteen time-domain statistical features are extracted, and PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction. The PSO algorithm is introduced to automatically optimize the kernel parameters of the SVM, significantly improving the model's classification accuracy and generalization capability. Experiments are conducted using the T-Motor MN2212 motor, with vibration signals collected at a sampling rate of 2000 Hz. The constructed dataset is used to compare multiple models. Results show that the proposed model achieves a recognition accuracy of 98.06% on the test set, outperforming models such as KNN, RF, MLP, and AE-SVM. These findings validate the effectiveness and engineering potential of the proposed method in UAV propulsion system fault diagnosis."

The objective is to enhance the concealment of the jet's infrared signature, thereby bolstering the aircraft's stealth capabilities. A parametric investigation, utilizing numerical simulations and experiments, is conducted to analyze the thrust coefficient, vectoring angle, flow coefficient, total pressure recovery, and flow structures. Results indicate that extending the lower wall of the BDTN nozzle has a minimal performance effect in a thrust vectoring condition of pitching-up but poses flow control challenges in a pitch-down state. When the rear body angle exceeds 45°, the asymmetry's influence diminishes with increasing angle. Adjusting the nozzle's extension length can mitigate the asymmetric effects. Overall, modifying the BDTN's base configuration and extending the lower wall enhance stealth performance while minimally affecting thrust and vectoring capabilities."

These cameras record a broad range of data, including media and telemetry, which can provide records of crime and incident scenes and help reconstruct events. This study presents a forensic analysis of the GoPro HERO13 and its accompanying application, GoPro Quik, on Android and iOS platforms. We identified the paths and locations of key digital artifacts generated by the camera and the application, such as user profiles and device information, camera-related data, and app usage artifacts. For media artifacts, we identified the locations of logs for footage stored locally or linked to the cloud, as well as records of deleted media. We described GoPro’s file naming conventions and its unique sensor metadata format, GPMF. These not only help ensure the integrity and continuity of media files but also provide contextual information about the moment the media was captured. This study provides insights for digital forensic investigations by detailing the digital evidence paths and data locations generated by the action camera, which can be valuable for incident reconstruction and contextual understanding."

A thermal-mechanical coupling model of large caliber gun barrel considering autofrettage and machine process is established. Equivalent relationship between swage autofrettage and hydraulic autofrettage is obtained and distribution and variation of residual stress during autofrettage and machine process is discussed. Then, stress state of gun bore under transient pressure and temperature load is analyzed. Results show that 1.05mm interfence of swage autofrettage has same effect compared to 915.

Circumferential residual stress of rifling land is released from 831.9MPa to 63.2MPa by machine process of rifling, which makes autofrettage has little influence on stress state of rifling land during firing."

    "abstract": "The growing demand for deploying Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) models like Stable Diffusion on resource-constrained edge devices challenges balancing quality, lightweight implementation, and portability. The emergence of WebAssembly (WASM) offers a compactcross-platform, and isolated runtime environment, making it a promising solution for efficient edge AIGC inference. However, current WASM based AI inference solutions are restricted to text interactions, offering limited support for image generation. To solve the challenges, we propose WebAssembly-Rust based WasmSD-Edge, a lightweight, edge-oriented AI image generation framework for high performance on-device Stable Diffusion inference on various edge devices. WasmSD-Edge employs a plugin-based architecture by integrating stable-diffusion.cpp as a WASM backend plugin for the WasmEdge runtime. It exposes a set of WebAssembly System Interfaces (WASI) to support text-to-image, image-to-image, and model convertion. Additionally, a Rust Crate SDK further enables developers to parametrically control inference process and output generation. To evaluate usability and portability of WasmSD-Edge on heterogeneous devices, we deployed it on heterogeneous devices. It achieves high inference speed and image quality with low resource consumption, offering a practical and efficient solution for deploying edge AIGC workflow. The implementation has been merged into WasmEdge — one of the largest WASM community, and source code are available at: https://github.com/WasmEdge/wasmedge-stable-diffusion."

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) defect detection is crucial for preventing power efficiency loss and fire hazards. The industry primarily relies on the fusion of infrared and visible images for defect localization and diagnosis. However, current detection methods exhibit poor generalizability in new site environments or with altered imaging setups. While recent infrared and vision foundation models (FM) facilitate domain-invariant feature maps extraction, directly concatenating them and fine-tuning achieves limited generalizability gain to PV defect detection, due to the asymmetric dual-modal semantics of defects. In this paper, we present the first large infrared-visible model DD-LIVM to enable cross-domain defect detection. The key innovation of DD-LIVM lies in its defect-specific three-step fine-tuning strategy, which utilizes alternating modality masking. Prior to feature fusion and joint fine-tuning, the infrared and visible FM encoders are alternately masked and optimized to enhance their individual semantic utility for defect localization visibility and classification granularity, with feature distances among different defect types regulated through contrastive learning. This approach allows for the extraction of generalizable and defect-specific feature maps. Moreover, for practical employment of DD-LIVM, we propose a domain-agnostic spatial alignment algorithm for infrared-visible images before dual-modal fusion, and develop source data augmentation and adaptive detection head selection schemes based on defects' infrared characteristics to further enhance the generalizability. Extensive experiments on 7,078 dual-modal images from 9 real-world scenarios across 4 cities' PV stations demonstrate that DD-LIVM achieves an accuracy of 87.7% for cross-domain defect detection, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 17.3%."

    "abstract": "For highly immersive mobile volumetric video streaming, it is essential to deliver photo-realistic full-scene content with smooth playback. Unlike traditional representations such as point clouds, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained attention for its ability to represent high-quality full-scene 3D content. However, our preliminary experiments show that existing methods for 3DGS-based videos fail to achieve smooth playback on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose Vega, a 3DGS-based photo-realistic full-scene volumetric video streaming system that ensures real-time playback on mobile devices. The core idea behind Vega's real-time rendering is object-level selective computation, which allocates computational resources to visually important objects to meet strict rendering deadlines. To enable mobile streaming based on the selective computation, Vega addresses two challenges: (1) designing an encoding scheme that optimizes the data size of videos while being compatible with object-level prioritization, and (2) developing a rendering pipeline that efficiently operates on resource-constrained mobile devices. We implemented an end-to-end Vega system, consisting of a streaming server and an Android application. Experimental results on commodity smartphones show that Vega achieves 30 frames per second (FPS) for full-scene volumetric video streaming while maintaining competitive data size and visual quality compared to existing baselines."

Regular and precise tremor monitoring is essential for optimizing treatment effectiveness. Existing at-home monitoring solutions have limitations in daily life due to low adherence, privacy concerns, or inevitable interference from confounding body components and overlapped motions. In this paper, we propose mmTremor, the first privacy-preserving contactless system to achieve practical tremor detection during activities of daily living (ADL) in real-world settings. We design a mmWave-depth fusion tracking algorithm to handle the high interference from confounding body components and a multimodal spatiotemporal deep learning pipeline to effectively exploit latent tremor information. Additionally, a spatial contrastive unsupervised adaptation is proposed for better discriminability and adaptation capability to unseen domains. To fully assess mmTremor in real-world scenarios, we collect a diverse dataset of 28 patients and 9 healthy subject simulations in over 20 distinct environments, including offices, hospitals, and homes. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that mmTremor achieves a high macro-F1 of 0.877 in tremor detection, showcasing the potential as a transformative contactless solution for tremor monitoring in daily life. The dataset will be open-source to facilitate future research."

    "abstract": "Accurate semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial structures, spectral heterogeneity, and scale variations inherent in urban scenes. To address the dual challenges of fine-grained spatial detail retention and precise semantic reconstruction, we propose a novel dual-attention-enhanced segmentation framework that integrates three complementary modules: Frequency-Aware Directional Attention (FADA), Category-Responsive Gated Attention (CRGA), and Selective Cross-Gating (SCG). Specifically, the proposed FADA module leverages wavelet decomposition to disentangle input features into directional high-frequency and structural low-frequency components. It adaptively aggregates orientation-sensitive attention maps, enabling the model to capture fine-grained textures and preserve boundary details more effectively. In parallel, the CRGA module is introduced in the decoder to dynamically modulate semantic features based on category-aware cues. By learning class-specific attention weights through a global guidance branch, CRGA enhances the discriminative power of category-sensitive regions while suppressing background noise and inter-class ambiguity. To further alleviate spatial misalignment in skip connections, the SCG module employs pixel- wise gating to selectively fuse encoder and decoder features, thereby facilitating spatially consistent feature propagation and improving structural detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, attaining mean IoU scores of 84.36% and 86.40%, respectively."

The paper introduces the Holographic Counterpart (HC) framework as a type of device-agnostic digital twin that could be used in a correctional setting to enable consistent and protected tamper-free digital monitoring. The framework uses a dual-way model of acquisition, one side being local extraction through Cellebrite UFED, Magnet AXIOM, and Autopsy, and the other side involving the cloud retrieval via vendor Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) so that it enjoys redundancy, interoperability, and evidentiary integrity. The information on Apple Watch, Fitbit Versa, and Samsung Galaxy Watch, plus publicly available data, produced more than 1.2 million multimodal points in 50 inmates and 120 sessions. A structured workflow of calibration, synchronization, sensor fusion, and composite anomaly scoring is designed to bolster the reliability of an analytical procedure. Experimental validation was 92 % precision, 89 % recall, and an F1-score of 0.90, which eliminated undetected anomalies by 37% and guaranteed 92% forensic traceability, which beat Z-score, DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest baselines. The HC framework proves to be successful in the detection of anomalies, forensic preparedness, and scalable and privacy-anonymized custodial healthcare monitoring. It comprises ethical issues such as minimization of data, consent management, and privacy protection, that is incorporated in order to make sure that the technology is used responsibly in correctional settings."

It has proven to significantly impair user performance in target selection, a fundamental interaction task. Existing research has established that latency negatively impacts selection times and success rates in 2D interactive systems; however, the underlying behavioral mechanisms remain unclear. This paper investigates the effects of latency on selection times, success rates, and endpoint distributions in Virtual Reality (VR) with controller-based raycasting and bare-hand direct touch—the two most common selection methods. Our results from a user study (N = 31) revealed distinct patterns between the two methods, leading to two novel mathematical models that account for latency, target width, and movement amplitude. These two models were validated via a new dataset collected from a second user study (N = 16) and were demonstrated to outperform the existing models. Our findings provide actionable recommendations to mitigate the negative impacts of latency and improve user experience in VR interface design."

To address this challenge, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LaPDA (Latent-space Point cloud Denoising with Adaptivity)</i>, a neural network explicitly designed to mitigate noise misalignment and enhance denoising robustness. LaPDA consists of two key stages. First, we adaptively model noise in the latent space, aligning unseen noise distributions with the known training distributions or adjusting them toward distributions with lower noise scales. Training objectives at this stage are formulated based on controlled synthetic noise with varying intensity levels. Second, we introduce a gradual noise removal module that optimizes the spatial distribution of the adaptively adjusted noisy points. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and scanned datasets demonstrate that LaPDA achieves enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the source code and test models publicly available."

Existing literature commonly assumes linearity during commutation to derive these switching functions, which can result in inaccuracy under specific conditions. This paper addresses this challenge by deriving (1) a more explicit expression for the analytical equations of the DC side, and (2) a more accurate expression on AC side switching function based on the line voltage during commutation period. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of delay and commutation angles on harmonics and provides insights of harmonic inclusion for different accuracy requirements. The proposed improvements are validated using the IEEE 34-bus system with an integrated LCC system."

The proposed framework implements fault diagnosis through a dual-stage approach: primary fault detection followed by phase localization. By establishing a short-circuit current model in the natural coordinate system, the current symmetrical components are derived under fault conditions. Theoretical investigations reveal distinct amplitude and phase-angle characteristics of these components during ITSC occurrences. The detection mechanism employs a normalized amplitude ratio between the first positive-sequence and the first negative-sequence components as a fault indicator. Subsequent phase localization is achieved by analyzing the phase difference between these characteristic components. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the reliability of the proposed method."

This paper introduces a tri-phase approach that includes intrusion detection, attack-type classification, and privacy-preserving techniques to address the cybersecurity challenges in DNP3-based SCADA systems in smart grids. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Gradient Boosting classifiers (GBM) are employed for attack detection and attack-type classification, achieving 99.51% and 99.50% accuracy, respectively. The proposed models are rigorously validated through k-fold cross-validation and further tested on two additional datasets to establish credibility and generalizability. Privacy-preserving mechanisms ensure data confidentiality without compromising operational efficiency, while feature engineering enhances interpretability and threat response. Moreover, the inclusion of adversarial indistinguishability analysis and the introduction of attack-type classification through an edge device for potential real-time deployment position this study as a state-of-the-art contribution. Experimental results confirm the framework’s effectiveness in mitigating cyber threats, preserving data integrity, and balancing privacy with utility, making it a strong foundation for securing DNP3-based SCADA systems in smart grids."

Data-driven control methods offer promising solutions by leveraging available trajectory data, but their performance can be compromised by noise and attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RDeeP-LCC</monospace>) framework based on data-driven reachability analysis. The framework over-approximates system dynamics under noise and attack using a matrix zonotope set derived from data, and develops a stabilizing feedback control law. By decoupling the mixed platoon system into nominal and error components, we employ data-driven reachability sets to recursively compute error reachable sets that account for noise and attacks, and obtain tightened safety constraints of the nominal system. This leads to a robust data-driven predictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner. Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RDeeP-LCC</monospace> method significantly improves robustness against noise and attacks, while enhancing tracking accuracy, control efficiency, energy economy, driving comfort, and driving safety."

    "abstract": "Driver distraction remains a leading cause of traffic accidents, posing a critical threat to road safety globally. As intelligent transportation systems evolve, accurate and real-time identification of driver distraction has become essential. However, existing methods struggle to capture both global contextual and fine-grained local features while contending with noisy labels in training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose DSDFormer, a novel framework that integrates the strengths of Transformer and Mamba architectures through a Dual State Domain Attention (DSDA) mechanism, enabling a balance between long-range dependencies and detailed feature extraction for robust driver behavior recognition. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Reasoning Confident Learning (TRCL), an unsupervised approach that refines noisy labels by leveraging spatiotemporal correlations in video sequences. Beyond achieving state-of-the-art results on AUC-V1, AUC-V2, and 100-Driver datasets, the proposed model is deployable in real-time on embedded platforms such as NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin and Xavier. Extensive experimental results confirm that DSDFormer and TRCL significantly improve both the accuracy and robustness of driver distraction detection, offering a scalable solution to enhance road safety.

However, effectively capturing both cross-dimension and cross-time dependencies in nonstationary time series remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the confounding effects of environmental factors. These factors often introduce spurious correlations that obscure the learning of meaningful temporal features. In this article, the novel framework <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Caformer</b> (<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ca</b>usal Trans<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">former</b>) is proposed for time-series forecasting grounded in causal reasoning, the science of identifying causality. The framework consists of four key modules: the dynamic learner, environment learner, temporal learner, and decompose learner. The dynamic learner uncovers dynamic interactions among features to model cross-dimension dependencies, while the temporal learner infers cross-time dependencies under causal constraints. The environment learner, together with the decompose learner, extracts environmental factors and applies a backdoor adjustment to mitigate the confounding effects on the time series. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Caformer achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and short-term forecasting. It achieves up to a 26.2% mean square error (mse) reduction on the traffic dataset and 21.8% on the electricity dataset compared to PatchTST, with consistent gains across eight long-term benchmarks. On the M4 dataset, Caformer ranks first across all 15 short-term forecasting categories. In addition to strong predictive accuracy, Caformer provides interpretable insights into the learned dependencies."

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due to the limited affective cues in unimodal representations and the difficulty of aligning heterogeneous features in multimodal systems. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved notable progress in affective understanding, they still suffer from hallucination, weak emotion discrimination, and instability during optimization. To address these challenges, this paper presents EmoBridge, a novel multimodal affective learning framework that integrates a large language model with a speech-aware cross-modal encoder, termed EmoBridge-Former, which extends the Q-Former architecture to model fine-grained audio–text emotional dependencies. In contrast to existing methods, EmoBridge introduces two improved optimization objectives: (1) a Prototypical InfoNCE loss, which enhances cross-modal alignment by pulling samples toward their emotion prototypes and enlarging inter-class separability; and (2) a Dynamic Focal Loss, which adaptively adjusts the weighting of hard and easy emotion samples to mitigate class imbalance and gradient domination. In addition, a soft-prompt fusion mechanism is employed to inject multimodal embeddings into the language model in a parameter-efficient manner, thereby enabling end-to-end affective reasoning. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmarks demonstrate that EmoBridge consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SER models in both accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework provides a unified and scalable paradigm for emotion-aware multimodal representation learning and has the potential to advance real-world speech understanding applications."

However, traditional federated learning suffers from three major f laws: 1.Vulnerability to Byzantine Attacks. 2.Privacy Leakage Risks. 3.Assumption of Third-Party Server Reliability. Few solutions currently address all three of these flaws at the same time. To address the above issues simultaneously, this paper introduces a multi-server federated learning approach that enhances security and privacy. We first set up a multi-server architecture to address the performance issues and single point of failure in traditional federated learning frameworks. And we set up and update different servers reputation on both the server and participant sides, which work together to resist aggregation attacks that can be implemented by malicious servers. It is also worth noting that we split models to be uploaded into two segments, each of which is uploaded to two different servers in conjunction with the last model of the previous round to defend against privacy attacks and keep model as complete as possible. Experiments on MNIST, IMDB, CIFAR10, and Adult indicate this method maintains accuracy, defends against label-flipping and Gaussian noise, and protects privacy."

This paper presents a Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) developed for a tendon-driven soft continuum wrist, integrated into the ’PRISMA HAND II’ prosthetic hand. The primary objective of our research is to design an adaptive controller that facilitates wrist movements eliminating external disturbances while minimizing computational requirements. To achieve this, kinematic and dynamic models of the wrist are developed based on the Piece-wise Constant Curvature (PCC) hypothesis. The controller consists of a reference model generated using the PCC model, and state errors are evaluated by comparing the responses of the reference model to those of the wrist model. These errors are reduced using the MRAC approach to make the wrist’s behavior closely align with that of the reference model. Stability of the closed-loop system is ensured using the Lyapunov direct method, along with the ’New Theorem of Stability’, a replacement for Barbalat’s lemma, ensuring that the error between the reference model and the actual system converges to zero and that the adaptive gains stabilize to fixed values. The adaptive performance of the controller is evaluated through experimental validations, where the motions of the prosthetic hand attached to the wrist are treated as unknown disturbances, and the mechanical stiffness of the wrist is considered as an uncertain parameter, resulting from the degradation of the internal springs."

To address this issue, a new method that uses a novel microwave transmission sensor working at two frequencies and a novel decoupling method is proposed to achieve moisture independent solid concentration measurement. A dual-frequency resonant printed dipole antenna is designed using finite element simulation method, and the microwave transmission sensor which can work at two frequencies is formed by two dipole antennas. A simple and effective decoupling method is proposed to extract moisture content from dual-frequency phase shift information, enabling solid concentration measurement. The flow structures of roping flow with varying solid concentrations and moisture contents are used to verify the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the dual-frequency phase shifts of the microwave transmission sensor are both sensitive to the solid concentration and moisture content. Therefore, only relying on the phase shift information from a single frequency cannot accurately measure solid concentration under conditions of varying moisture content. The decoupling method proposed in this study, based on dual-frequency phase shift information, can accurately determines moisture content. Consequently, it enables solid concentration measurement in gas-solid flows with relative errors within ±5% under conditions of varying moisture content."

Although the existence of such sequences has been assumed in previous works, their explicit construction is presented here for the first time, along with a performance assessment when the observed sums are disturbed by noise. UD sequences are defined as sets of integers that satisfy the unique-sum property. The construction of the sets is algebraically defined depending on two Galois fields with related dimensions. We use the Bose-Chowla-Lindström approach to computationally find such integer sets that are obtained with reasonable computational complexity. In comparison with orthogonal binary real sequences, these sequences use fewer bits in equivalent setups. The binary signature sequences are mapped to some binary antipodal modulation and assessed in the multiple access adder channel (MAAC) disturbed by noise. Both hard and soft maximum likelihood detectors are used to assess the probability of misidentifying an active user."

    "abstract": "Shoreline detection from satellite imagery is a well-established method for monitoring and managing coastal areas. The shoreline, commonly defined as the boundary between land and sea, can be determined from satellite images using classification techniques. However, no single classification method consistently achieves superior performance. Supervised approaches generally deliver high accuracy but are time-consuming and prone to human error in the selection of training data. Unsupervised approaches, in contrast, are strongly influenced by scene characteristics, particularly the relative proportions of water and non-water pixels, which can significantly affect classification results. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a fully automated hybrid classification approach that combines the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised methods. The procedure applies an unsupervised k-means algorithm to a selected portion of the dataset to automatically generate training samples, which are then used to train supervised classification algorithms without manual intervention. The methodology is evaluated using Sentinel-2 imagery of the southwestern coast of Sicily, Italy. Classification is based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from the green and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Accuracy is assessed using confusion matrices, with pixel size additionally considered as a parameter influencing shoreline precision. Results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method outperforms both traditional supervised and unsupervised techniques, achieving the highest thematic accuracy while significantly reducing the need for manual training data collection. This approach shows strong potential for shoreline monitoring at large spatial scales and over extended time periods."

This study establishes a dynamic model of a twin-engine aircraft's ground motion to investigate the directional correction capability of nose wheel steering under asymmetric thrust. Simulation results indicate that the nose wheel steering angle can effectively suppress aircraft deviation within a certain range. Specifically, the correction capability increases as the steering angle grows within the range of 0~10°; it gradually saturates between 10~15°; and further increasing the steering angle leads to a decline in correction capability. In extreme conditions with a 100% thrust difference due to single-engine failure, relying solely on nose wheel steering is insufficient to fully correct the aircraft's deviation. However, for thrust differences of 80% and below, the nose wheel steering demonstrates adequate correction capability."

This optimization-based approach provides a principled and flexible framework that generalizes traditional estimators and accommodates a variety of geometries through the choice of Bregman divergences.A key advantage of our method is that it scales efficiently with the number of candidate components f<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</inf>; that is, one can employ a large set of basis distributions in the mixture model without incurring significant computational overhead.

A three-dimensional parametric model was developed with precise dimensional specifications for the clamp connection mechanism. The fluid-structure interaction during water entry was simulated using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) algorithm in LS-DYNA. Systematic numerical investigations were conducted on the water entry process with varying impact velocities (60–120 m/s) and entry angles (60°-90°). The analysis focused on hull stress distribution patterns and transient impact load variations between segments, revealing the fundamental mechanisms governing inter-segment structural responses. The results demonstrate that the inter-segment impact acceleration exhibits bidirectional oscillations due to complex hydrodynamic coupling effects. Both increased entry velocity and steeper impact angle significantly amplify peak acceleration magnitudes. Notably, critical stress concentrations exceeding material yield strength were identified at Clamp 2 location during initial water impact, indicating high vulnerability to plastic deformation and posing substantial threats to structural integrity. These findings provide crucial insights for optimizing the impact-resistant design of multi-segment underwater vehicles operating in high-speed water entry conditions."

Today, this concept has expanded vastly into diverse data, and the term <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">biometrics</i> has been introduced to encompass all methods of automated human recognition, such as fingerprint, face, iris, retina, and voice analysis. More recently, neuroimaging data have been explored for this purpose, giving rise to the concept of “brain fingerprints,” derived from patterns of functional networks. This perspective challenges the classical view of neuroimaging analysis, which treats individuals as repeated measures of a population-level effect, where interindividual differences are considered noise rather than signal. In contrast, intersubject variability here represents the key feature in the data allowing the unique representation and identification of an individual. This marks a paradigm shift that has sparked a wave of new interdisciplinary research, branching from neuroscience to machine learning and signal processing."

    "abstract": "In lossy compression, Wang et al. [1] recently introduced the rate-distortion-perception-classification function, which supports multi-task learning by jointly optimizing perceptual quality, classification accuracy, and reconstruction fidelity. Building on the concept of a universal encoder introduced in [2], we investigate the universal representations that enable a broad range of distortion-classification tradeoffs through a single shared encoder coupled with multiple task-specific decoders. We establish, through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiment, that for a Gaussian source under mean-squared error (MSE) distortion, the distortion-classification tradeoff region can be achieved using a single universal encoder. For general sources, we characterize the achievable region and identify conditions under which a universal encoder can produce a small distortion penalty. The experimental result on the MNIST dataset further supports our theoretical findings. We show that universal encoders can obtain distortion performance comparable to task-specific encoders. These results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed universal framework in multi-task compression scenarios."

Existing work on runtime modality adaptation uses fixed connections between data encoders and LLM's input layer, but results in high training costs and ineffective cross-modal interaction. In this paper, we present MPnP, a new modality adaptation technique that connects data encoders to a flexible set of last LLM blocks and makes such latent connections fully trainable at runtime. Evaluation results show that MPnP has high compute and data efficiency, with 3.7× FLOPs reduction and 30% memory usage reduction compared to best baselines. It requires only few hundreds of training samples at runtime, and completes modality adaptation within few minutes on weak devices."

The system delivers the first demonstration of a mmWave backscatter system capable of exploiting the capabilities of MIMO radars for the 3D localization of mmID tags moving at high speeds and accelerations at long ranges by introducing a critical Doppler disambiguation algorithm and a fully-integrated cross-polarized dielectric-lens-based mmID tag consuming a mere 68 μW. DragonFly was extensively evaluated in static and dynamic configurations, including on a flying quadcopter, and benchmarked against multiple baselines, demonstrating its ability to track the positions of multiple tags with a median 3D accuracy of 12 cm at speeds and acceleration on the order of 10 m s–1 and 4 m s–2 and at ranges of up to 50 m."

These characteristics make them well-suited for simultaneous transmission and reflection beamforming, breaking the constraint of transmit/reflect-only beamforming that limits service to single side of metasurface. In this paper, we propose Pano-Glass, an optically transparent metasurface enables seamless panoramic coverage in both signal propagation and visual experience. By configuring the reflection/transmission states and phase responses of the unit cells designed based on extended Huygens' metasurface principle, PanoGlass achieves simultaneous control of reflective/transmissive signals. Assembling metal mesh patterns onto a glass substrate, PanoGlass attains an optical transparency of 89.5%, which satisfies the demand of a variety of applications. We develop a 0.472×0.472m2 prototype with 24×24 unit cells. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PanoGlass achieves received signal strength enhancements of 13.9 dB and bit error rate decrease of 98% compared with ordinary glass."

It reconstructs internal conductivity distributions from boundary voltage measurements but suffers from ill-posedness, sensitivity to noise and limited spatial resolution when solved using traditional iterative methods. This work proposes a hybrid reconstruction architecture that combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The transformer extracts global contextual features from voltage measurements, while the PINN enforces the quasistatic conduction equation with Neumann boundary conditions through a physics-informed loss function. Although trained and evaluated on synthetic data, the proposed PINN-ViT model demonstrates improved reconstruction accuracy and noise robustness over classical algorithms and purely data-driven networks. These results indicate its potential for future deployment in energy-efficient, real-time EIT systems for mobile healthcare applications."

In this demo, we present NanoScatter, the first backscatter network with each tag implemented using our customized backscatter communication ASIC. We propose a nanowatt wake-up receiver design and a sensitivity-driven downlink/uplink modulation mechanism to carry out the ASIC, which enables minimizing the tag's power consumption and long-range communication. NanoScatter supports concurrent communication of 6 IC-based tags with a subcarrier capacity of 512, achieving communication distances of 66 m indoors and 100 m outdoors. The tag consumes 1 μW in idle listening, with the core circuit using 58 nW and 43 μW during communication."

Inspired by this finding, we design ChronoBite, a closed-loop feedback system that pairs real-time inflammation scores with periodic cellular aging insights. In addition to regular calorie tracking, it uses fast-changing DII signals and slow-moving cellular aging markers to guide users toward age-aware eating habits. ChronoBite is a mobile-based prototype that combines food recognition, DII analysis, and cellular aging insights to deliver age-aware dietary feedback. Powered by large language models (LLMs), it offers real-time recommendations while supporting long-term tracking of inflammation patterns and telomere dynamics."

But these requirements may later need to be changed. Requirement changes are a leading cause of project failure because they can waste the work the team completed on the original requirements. Despite considerable efforts on reducing requirement change, some requirement volatility seems inevitable. Instead of tracking conformance to fixed requirements, the manager should track conformance to volatile requirements. This paper derives a new measure of conformance to volatile requirements. Requirement volatility is estimated using reference class forecasting information on the volatility of similar requirements in past projects. The measure is illustrated using a set-based design case study of 50,000 army aerial reconnaissance drones."

    "abstract": "Satellite IoT has emerged as a promising solution to extend connectivity beyond terrestrial networks, particularly in remote and underserved regions. However, grant-free random access (GF-RA) in satellite networks faces two key challenges: severe interference from massive uncoordinated terminals and limited computational resources on satellite platforms. In contrast to terrestrial multipath channels, the dominant line-of-sight propagation in satellite-terrestrial links induces deterministic spatial correlations between terminal positions and angles-of-arrival (AoAs). To leverage this property, a hierarchical satellite-terrestrial cooperative processing architecture is proposed, where computationally intensive terminal positioning tasks are offloaded to the terrestrial center, and satellites focus on real-time joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE). In this framework, we propose a location-prior-aided JADCE algorithm that incorporates terminal position information into the message-passing process to prune low-probability propagation paths and reduce computational complexity. The algorithm further integrates an expectation-maximization procedure to refine AoA estimates and optimize model hyperparameters. Furthermore, a region-based location management scheme is introduced to enable efficient terminal location estimation and storage. Based on this scheme, region affiliation probabilities are computed by evaluating the expectation of the posterior distribution conditioned on AoA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements over benchmark schemes in terms of terminal activity detection and channel estimation accuracy."

Recent works transform the original discrete time-varying volumetric data into continuous Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to address the issues of compression, rendering, and super-resolution in both spatial and temporal domains. However, training the INR takes a long time to converge, especially when handling large-scale time-varying volumetric datasets. In this work, we proposed F-Hash, a novel feature-based multi-resolution Tesseract encoding architecture to greatly enhance the convergence speed compared with existing input encoding methods for modeling time-varying volumetric data. The proposed design incorporates multi-level collision-free hash functions that map dynamic 4D multi-resolution embedding grids without bucket waste, achieving high encoding capacity with compact encoding parameters. Our encoding method is agnostic to time-varying feature detection methods, making it a unified encoding solution for feature tracking and evolution visualization. Experiments show the F-Hash achieves state-of-the-art convergence speed in training various time-varying volumetric datasets for diverse features. We also proposed an adaptive ray marching algorithm to optimize the sample streaming for faster rendering of the time-varying neural representation."

These observations are linked to differences in electron trapping and deceleration dynamics. In particular, for the negative polarity impulse, the trailing edge field predominantly decelerates electrons catching up from behind the pulse, resulting in more effective energy extraction. In contrast, the trailing edge of the positive polarity impulse exhibits predominantly accelerating fields, reducing the efficiency of energy transfer. These polarity-dependent effects are not present in CW sinusoidal amplification, for which the electrons become trapped and reaccelerated within each bunch in saturation."

    "abstract": "The power system protection of isolated microgrids powered by inverter-based resources (IBRs) presents unique challenges due to the limited fault currents and the dependency of fault characteristics on control strategies employed in IBRs. Fault currents contributed from IBRs differ in magnitude and characteristics compared to those from synchronous generators (SGs), making traditional power systems protection schemes ineffective. In this paper, key differences of the fault current behavior from IBRs and SGs are firstly explored; the functionality of protection schemes in inverter based isolated microgrids (IBIMGs), including the fault detection, fault protection, directional relaying, and fault classification, are then examined, demonstrating the associated challenges. A review of power system protection methods in the literature for IBIMGs is also conducted, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Future research directions in the protection of IBIMGs are recommended in the paper."

    "abstract": "Middleboxes play a critical role in network operations, providing various network service functions, and can be implemented as software on general-purpose servers through network function virtualization technology. The unavailability of middlebox functions is an essential metric of the overall quality of network services. This paper proposes an analytical model that calculates the unavailability of middlebox functions, where multiple backup servers protect one or more functions, and one backup server can recover at most two functions simultaneously, which we call the double-capacity multiple-backup model. While the single-capacity multiple-backup model, where each backup server can recover at most one function, has been studied, the double-capacity multiple-backup model has not been addressed. The proposed double-capacity multiple-backup model allows for load balancing among backup servers. The proposed model can have two different workload strategies: load-persistent (LP) and load-distributing (LB). We use a Markov chain to analyze state transitions and develop equilibrium-state equations, providing a method to compute function unavailability for each strategy. Numerical results observe that these two strategies have almost the same unavailability. Since the LB strategy incurs additional operational costs compared to the LP strategy, the LP strategy is preferable. We also find that the double-capacity multiple-backup model reduces unavailability by 7.21–81.9% compared to the single-backup model in the examined cases."

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave full-digital full-connected multibeam array can play a crucial role in meeting the massive data capacity demands for the future Internet of Things. In this paper, a novel digital predistortion (DPD) technique is designed to linearize this array for the scenario under constraint bandwidth. Two different linearization schemes, including beam-oriented DPD schemes and PA-oriented DPD schemes, are analyzed and compared, along with their respective applicable scenarios. Based on the characteristics of full-digital full-connected arrays, and by fully leveraging the alleviation of adjacent channel power ratio metrics requirement in FR2 band specification, the band-limited DPD concept can be effectively integrated into the full-digital full-connected multibeam array architecture, which allows for the array linearization with low system bandwidth requirements without introducing an analog filter for each PA. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, the simulations are analyzed for an array with 6-beam 64-chain configuration. Furthermore, experiments on a 2-beam 4-chain full-digital full-connected array are verified at the center frequency of 26 GHz with different modulated bandwidth scenarios. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method successfully achieves expected linearization performance for wideband multibeam array."

    "abstract": "This study proposes a low-complexity genetic algorithm-based (LC-GA) detector to achieve the complexity-accuracy trade-off in non-coherent short-packet communication (SPC) employing modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ). This study rigorously proves that the inverse matrix in the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is a Hermitian positive definite matrix. In addition, by exploiting Cholesky decomposition, the computationally intensive full matrix inversion is reduced to the lower triangular matrix inversion, thus significantly decreasing the fitness function’s complexity under the ML criterion. The proposed genetic algorithm (GA) incorporates tailored crossover and mutation operators combined with an elitism strategy and achieves optimal detection accuracy without exhaustive search. Further, single-input multiple-output (SIMO) diversity reception is validated through simulations to combat frequency-selective fading. The results demonstrate that for transmitted data length of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i> = 16, the LC-GA detector can achieve identical bit error rate (BER) performance as the ML detector with 88% fewer iterations, yielding the SNR improvements of 0.5 dB and 1.2 dB over the Viterbi and direct zero-testing (DiZeT) detectors at BER = 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup>, respectively.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rise of smart cities, achieving efficient and accurate indoor localization has become essential for indoor location-based services. However, current deep learning-based indoor localization methods often rely on fixed activation functions during RSSI feature extraction and learning, which limits their ability to capture complex geospatial information embedded in RSSI signals. This results in reduced localization accuracy and weak robustness. To address this problem, we propose AFLoc, a deep learning indoor localization method with trainable activation functions. Specifically, we first design AFLayer, a trainable activation function module grounded in the universal approximation theorem of single-layer neural networks. Then, we integrate convolutional neural network with Transformer to extract both global and local features from RSSI Sequence data. Finally, by incorporating AFLayer into the CNN-Transformer feature extraction framework, each layer is equipped with a trainable activation function, enhancing the network’s ability to learn discriminative RSSI features and capture richer geospatial information, ultimately improving localization accuracy. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that AFLoc achieves superior performance compared to existing localization methods across both the SODIndoorLoc and WIFIne public datasets."

    "abstract": "Fluxgate sensors are renowned for their high sensitivity and stability in detecting low-frequency magnetic fields, yet their performance is often constrained by the magnetic properties of the sensing core and the efficiency of magnetic flux coupling. This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the design and optimization of Vacquier-type fluxgate sensors incorporating magnetic flux concentrators (MCs) and micro-patterned grooved sensing cores to enhance sensitivity and signal amplitude. By integrating triangular and bar-shaped MCs with varying geometries and grooved cores featuring 1, 3, or 6 micro-patterned lines, we systematically explore the interplay between flux amplification and shape-induced magnetic anisotropy. Finite element method simulations reveal that triangular MCs, particularly in the dual triangular MCs with a six-line grooved core (T6T), achieve a magnetic flux density of 1.40 T at the sensing core, a 15% improvement over the baseline single-bar core SC of 1.20 T. Experimental results demonstrate that the T6T sensor delivers an output voltage of 426.5 mV-90 times greater than the SC and a sensitivity of 4600 V/T, surpassing conventional MEMS fluxgate sensors. The grooved core design reduces the demagnetization factor by up to 36%, enhancing magnetic stability and susceptibility by 54%. These advancements enable high-resolution detection of magnetic fields as low as 100 nT, making the proposed sensor architecture highly suitable for applications in biomagnetic measurements, geophysical exploration, and space magnetometry. This work establishes a robust framework for designing next-generation fluxgate sensors with superior performance in compact form factors."

    "abstract": "As various 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been introduced to the market, research on multisession simultaneous localization and mapping (MSS) using heterogeneous LiDAR sensors has been actively conducted. Existing MSS methods mostly rely on loop closure detection for intersession alignment; however, the performance of loop closure detection can be potentially degraded owing to the differences in the density and field of view (FoV) of the sensors used in different sessions. In this study, we challenge the existing paradigm that relies heavily on loop detection modules and propose a novel MSS framework, called Multi-Mapcher, that employs large-scale mapto- map registration to perform inter-session initial alignment, which is commonly assumed to be infeasible, by leveraging outlier-robust 3D point cloud registration. Next, after finding inter-session loops by radius search based on the assumption that the inter-session initial alignment is sufficiently precise, anchor node-based robust pose graph optimization is employed to build a consistent global map. As demonstrated in our experiments, our approach shows substantially better MSS performance for various LiDAR sensors used to capture the sessions and is faster than state-of-the-art approaches."

The terminal cost is a function related only to the terminal position of the evader. This problem has been extensively studied in target defense games. Here, we prove that a candidate for the value function generated by geometric method is the viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation (HJI PDE) Dirichlet problem. Therefore, the value function of the game at each point can be computed by a mathematical program. In our work, the convexity of the terminal cost or the target is not required. The terminal cost only needs to be locally Lipschitz continuous. The cases in which the terminal costs or the targets are not convex are covered. Therefore, our result is more universal than those of previous studies, and the complexity of the proof is improved. We also discuss the optimal strategies in this game and present an intuitive explanation of this value function."

Wideband frequency adjustment is demonstrated through discrete coarse-tuning (LM injection/discharge) and continuous fine-tuning (precise LM segments repositioning). The underlying operational mechanisms are analyzed by establishing an equivalent circuit model (ECM).

A modified method was applied to enforce the total current in the cross-section without having to introduce cross-sectional subdivisions separated by highly resistive layers, as required in conventional models. The coil domain was not divided into subdomains, resulting in a more continuous current distribution. The resulting Lorentz force density was used in a 3D mechanical model with turn-to-turn contact conditions to represent the dry-wound racetrack coil. The analysis showed that screening current caused both the typical expansion of the straight sections and additional tilting deformation, increasing the peak stress by 23.6%. Lastly, the three-dimensional analysis results of the racetrack coil SCS were compared with those obtained from a two-dimensional analysis based on the plane stress assumption."

The proposed approach incorporates client-specific dropout masks that are resampled at each communication round, creating an implicit ensemble effect that mitigates overfitting to local data distributions. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of non-IID data partitions using Dirichlet distribution (α=0.1, 0.5, 1.0). Despite computational constraints limiting our study to 2 clients and 4 communication rounds, results demonstrate that the stochastic updating approach achieves 84.08% test accuracy compared to 81.28% for standard FedAvg, representing a 2.8 percentage point improvement with reduced communication variance. The method shows particular promise for resource-constrained federated settings where communication efficiency is critical."

To reach this goal, in addition to the standard radio access, it is foreseen that users can connect to 5G services via different access networks (e.g., Wi-Fi), through the well-defined non-3GPP access technology. Based on some security aspects, it can be distinguished as trusted and untrusted non-3GPP access.This paper aims to show how to improve overall 5G non-3GPP access performance by optimizing data rate and strengthening security, achieved through the selection of the most suitable ciphering and authentication algorithm combination. After providing a detailed comparison between trusted and untrusted access types and related differences, we describe how to maximize the available bandwidth using fast and secure IPSec authentication and encryption algorithms, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and security. A surprising outcome of this study reveals that, although users are expected to experience higher data rates on trusted non-3GPP access due to the absence of encryption overhead, the use of new-generation ciphers such as AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data), which ensures both confidentiality and message authenticity through a single, efficient operation, can achieve up to a twofold increase in throughput compared to historical approaches considering encryption and authentication as separate operations."

The evaluated methods include the Runge-Kutta method, generalized-alpha method, and backward differentiation formula (BDF) method. Numerical simulations under multiple working conditions yield the following conclusions: All three methods stably generate accurate dynamic results for flexible variable-length cables. Regarding constraint violation correction, the generalized-alpha and BDF methods demonstrate higher accuracy without requiring the conversion of DAEs into ordinary differential equations. In terms of step size, the generalized-alpha method allows larger time steps. However, the Runge-Kutta method exhibits superior computational efficiency. The generalized-alpha method strikes a balance for scenarios requiring strict constraint enforcement and moderate computational resources, whereas the Runge-Kutta method is preferable for efficiency-critical applications with minor constraint violations."

Leveraging a multi-modal approach, the system integrates Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel2 optical data, contextual meteo-oceanographic variables, AIS signals, and synthetic wake simulations. A deep learning pipeline, comprising a YOLOv11x-based segmentation model, a sea-state classification module, and a post-processing block for motion estimation, has been developed and validated across a series of experimental campaigns. These include controlled trials in the Venice Lagoon (July 2024) and real-world deployments in the Gulfs of Naples and Salerno (May-June 2025). Results show consistent wake detection across optical modalities, with strong alignment between model outputs and AIS records. A final campaign scheduled for September 2025 will further assess performance under diverse sea states and vessel classes. UEIKAP aims to provide a robust, extensible tool for maritime surveillance and environmental monitoring, with open-access datasets and tools scheduled for release by the end of 2025."

    "abstract": "Drones have become essential tools in applications ranging from surveillance to disaster management, but their misuse poses significant security threats that require effective detection and classification techniques. While various detection methods exist, RF-based approaches offer high accuracy by using the unique spectral signatures emitted during drone communication, avoiding common issues found in visual or audio systems. However, there is significant lack of formatting and organization in public and private datasets for RF-based signals, which can hinder the use of said datasets for further research.This paper presents a comparative analysis of four RF-based drone detection datasets: DroneRF, CardRF, VTI_DroneSET_FFT, and Drone-Remote-Controller-RF-Signal-Dataset. We evaluated the experimental methodologies, including the number and types of drones used, signal features extracted, the data collection environment, the use of the RF chamber, noise mitigation techniques and classification models used. Additionally, we replicated the DroneRF analysis using CardRF data and vice versa to assess cross-dataset reproducibility, as well as investigate the robustness of the datasets concerning different RF channel conditions, variations in training and testing environments, and the overall classification accuracy. This process also revealed key challenges that hindered reproducibility and interoperability between datasets, such as inconsistent and insufficient documentation, hard-coded local file paths, and language-specific dependencies. Our study provides insight into the impact of these methodological differences on drone detection and classification performance in the real world and the importance of standardized data formats and well-documented workflows to enable consistent cross-platform RF-based drone detection research."

Previous works focus on only one of these two strategies or formulate optimization problems that are hard to solve and propose a suboptimal solution. In this paper, we propose a linear model for the joint task caching and offloading optimization problem. Moreover, we present two efficient heuristics which provide close-to-optimal results in terms of energy efficiency with a low execution time. We further prove that the offloading subproblem can be solved with an optimal algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the performance and scalability of our propositions by extensive simulations on a large number of $10^{5}$ mobile devices"

Selecting paths requires giving scores to the alternative solutions to drive a choice. While previous studies have provided comprehensive evaluation of single-path solutions, the same level of detail is lacking when considering sets of paths. This paper emphasizes that the path characterization strongly depends on the properties under consideration. While property-based characterization is also valid for single paths, it becomes crucial to analyse multiple path sets. From the above consideration, this paper proposes a mathematical approach, defining a functional model that lends itself well to characterizing the path set in its general formulation. The paper shows how the functional model contextualizes specific attributes."

The sea ice covering the Southern Ocean not only reacts rapidly to these changes, but also influences and alters the physical properties of the atmospheric boundary layer and the underlying ocean on various scales. In that regard, polynyas, i.e. regions of open water and thin ice within the closed pack ice, play a key role as being regions of enhanced atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions and extensive new ice formation during winter. The experimental analysis is based on a series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions collected in single-polarization mode, during both the expansion and contraction stages of the Terra Nova Bay polynya. These data are complemented by auxiliary observations from passive microwave instruments. In this study, preliminary results show that the ability of a single SAR scene to identify the open polynya growing and closing phases.

The results indicate that self-excited tangential combustion instability can be achieved through an offcenter injector configuration. The oscillation frequency within the combustion chamber was observed to switch from 2100 Hz to 2700 Hz as the oxidizer flow rate increased. Based on the theoretical analysis, the oscillation modes were identified as 1 T1L and 2TOL, respectively. In both cases, the flame exhibited a lifted state, where variations in lift height altered the phase relationships between heat release and acoustic oscillations, thereby influencing the instability conditions."

    "abstract": "Human activity monitoring in the water is essential for pool management and drowning prevention. Existing camera-based solutions pose significant concerns about privacy and extra installation costs. Although sonars have been widely used for underwater sensing in open aquatic environments such as oceans and lakes, monitoring human activities with sonars in a pool setup is still challenging. In this work, we propose AquaScan, the first scanning sonar-based underwater sensing system for human activity monitoring. To overcome the low frame rate due to the sonar's physical limitation, we propose a novel scanning strategy and apply an image reconstruction method to accelerate the scanning speed without compromising the performance of motion detection. To overcome the dynamic interferences in the underwater scenario, we develop a novel signal processing pipeline based on a physical model to remove noises and localize human subjects. We further extract features like motion, time, and spatial information from sonar images and develop a state-transfer-based activity recognition system to recognize five common water activities, i.e., swimming, motionless, splashing, struggling, and drowning. We have deployed AquaScan on three public swimming pools for a total period of 94 hours. The evaluation results show that AquaScan can successfully recognize the five activities in the water with around 91.5%."

However, they are limited by a constrained weight learning space and activation functions, which restricts their data processing capabilities. To address this, we propose an RF circuit-based weighted diffraction NN (WDNN) that rivals digital NNs in processing ability. We design a weighted asymmetric RF coupler unit that, when stacked into a network, enables diffractive propagation with arbitrary connection weights. Additionally, an activation module is introduced that utilizes RF amplifiers operating in their nonlinear regions. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed WDNN through three tasks: 32-level amplitude modulated (AM) signal decoding, 31-class angle of arrival (AoA) estimation, and 2-class Wi-Fi based fall detection. After training, WDNN achieves the accuracy of 98.5%, 93.7%, and 90.8% in the AM decoding, AoA estimation, and fall detection tasks, respectively; while the diffractive NN SOTA achieves only 21.6%, 16.9%, and 63.3%. We also implement the prototypes of WDNN and SOTA, and real-world experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of up to 76.85% across various tasks compared to SOTA."

In this work, we describe a networked iGYM implementation that allows teams of players to play with each other remotely. The key networking challenge is meeting tight end-to-end latency requirements for interactive play over the Internet. We demonstrate a portable tabletop version of iGYM, implemented in Unity and ROS2, using a distributed authority model to keep track of ownership and propagate state updates about players, game objects, and scores. Each client receives local player tracking updates and spawns player peripersonal circles under its own authority; a shared ball object is synchronized under server ownership with clientside interpolation. The demo GUI will let attendees inject artificial network delay to explore its impact on interactivity."

In our SIGMETRICS 2025 publication, we introduced a new residential dataset---we have been collecting traffic from ~1000 off-campus residences that house faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and their families. Although our residents are university affiliates, our dataset captures their activity at home, and we show that this dataset offers a distinct perspective from the campus and dorm traffic. We also investigate the serving infrastructures and services accessed by the residences. Extending this published work, since May 2025, we have improved our pipeline efficiency to enable continuous 24/7 data collection and scale up to approximately 1500 residences, providing a more complete view of the residential network. We also make the dataset available for research use upon request, with the goal of motivating and supporting future research."

    "abstract": "As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments.

Meanwhile, ground-based systems alone often fail to fulfill these requirements, motivating the exploration of non-terrestrial solutions such as LEO-assisted advanced modulation techniques. This paper investigates the application of spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) techniques in LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems. A shadowed Rician fading model is employed to characterize the LEO-to-ground channel, incorporating realistic path loss, Doppler effects and others. Moreover, comprehensive analytical performance, with closed-form BER upper bounds, is derived for both LEO-SM and LEO-SSK schemes. To further enhance reliability, a gradient descent-based satellite elevation angle optimization method is proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed schemes achieve improved error performance and reduced detection complexity compared to traditional modulation. Furthermore, trade-offs between spectral efficiency and complexity are analyzed and discussed, demonstrating the practical feasibility of applying SM/SSK to future LEO satellite-assisted wireless systems."

    "abstract": "Visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) are crucial for robot navigation in GPS-denied environments. However, most existing methods are developed for general-purpose robotics and are unsuitable for high-speed, resource-constrained loitering munitions. To address these limitations, we propose LM-VINS, a robust and efficient visual-inertial navigation system for high-speed loitering munitions. First, a hybrid feature-tracking strategy is designed that balances accuracy and efficiency by using learning-based feature tracking for keyframes and optical flow tracking for non-keyframes. Then, a bio-inspired dual-memory system is designed for place recognition, so as to mitigate long-term drift through reward-driven priority ranking and generative replay. Finally, these two components are integrated into a tightly-coupled optimization framework to refine the pose estimation of the loitering munition. To evaluate our proposed approach, we construct LM-1600, the first visual-inertial dataset specifically for loitering munitions. Experimental results show that the system achieves an absolute trajectory error (ATE) of 11.971 m, representing a 31.7% improvement over AirVO, while operating at only 40% CPU utilization on an Intel Core i9-13900H processor. The proposed VINS framework paves the way for the enhancement of the autonomy and reliability of loitering munitions in GPS-denied environments and the enabling of more robust operations in complex and dynamic scenarios."

First, three spatiotemporal parameters (interconnection time <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R(t)$</tex-math></inline-formula>, transmission capacity <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$C(t)$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and propagation delay <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$D_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) are defined. The rationality and consistency of AHP-BSA is proved using the spatiotemporal parameters. In the parameter calculation phase of AHP-BSA, this paper further proves the relationship between <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R(t)$</tex-math></inline-formula> and outage probability, as well as between <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$D_{p}$</tex-math></inline-formula> and transmission efficiency. Then, a parameter optimization algorithm is designed in AHP-BSA. These spatiotemporal parameters are normalized, weighted, and incorporated into the parameter optimization algorithm. Through stability-aware adjustment, it adjusts scheduling decisions in response to link dynamics and real-time fluctuations. Simulation results confirm that AHP-BSA outperforms existing methods in transmission capacity, time complexity, and long-term traffic balance."

In this paper, a Hierarchical Adaptive Self-Attention Guided Ensemble Band Selection Approach (HASGEBSA) is proposed. It is an ensemble of statistical distance, dependence measures, with an explainable AI interpretability to identify the most discriminative and optimal spectral bands. After selecting the top-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> most optimal and informative spectral bands, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>-channel images are constructed that preserve the spatial structure and spectral redundancy. Then these images are fed into a lightweight kchannel convolutional model that contains a pre-trained VGG16 backbone to exploit both spectral and spatial features. The experiments are conducted on the Indian Pines (IP) and EuroSAT datasets. The results show that HASGEBSA achieves classification accuracy of 99% and 96%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed model is lightweight with only ~7M trainable parameters, which shows its significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency."

In this paper, we present Structure-Preserving Tensor Principal Component Analysis (SPTPCA), a dimensionality reduction method based on the generalized tensor <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\ast _{\\mathcal {L}}$</tex-math></inline-formula> -product framework that addresses this gap.

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid expansion of EVs (Electric Vehicles), current EV charging systems remain inconvenient for users. To address this issue, robot-assisted EV charging systems are emerging as promising solutions, requiring precise EV inlet localization as a key technology. However, existing vision-based methods face fundamental trade-offs: 2D RGB provides dense visual information but suffers from illumination sensitivity and depth ambiguity, while 3D PC (Point Cloud) provides geometric precision with limitations in sparse structures and high computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose MDSNet (Multimodal Dual Stream Network), a novel framework that combines 2D and 3D CNNs through two key innovations: (1) modality-specific axial attention mechanisms for efficient feature fusion, and (2) hierarchical data slicing, tailored to each modality-specific characteristic. Unlike single-modality approaches, MDSNet effectively leverages complementary strengths while mitigating individual weaknesses of both RGB and PC data. The proposed method is evaluated on RGB-PC data pairs acquired from realistic EV scenarios under various real-world environments including multiple distances, viewing angles, and illumination variations. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, establishing MDSNet as a practical solution for autonomous robot-assisted EV charging systems."

In this paper, we propose a unified framework that leverages hyperspherical embeddings with learnable class centers for both open-set and closed-set recognition. Each class is represented by a center point uniformly distributed on the surface of a hypersphere, and training samples are encouraged to form compact clusters around their respective centers. Unlike previous methods that constrain features to the hypersphere boundary, we adopt a Euclidean distance-based formulation to improve flexibility and generalization. Our approach jointly optimizes class centers and feature representations, eliminating the reliance on predefined center locations. Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to incorporate background or unknown samples during training to further enhance open-set robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in both open-set and closed-set settings.

However, a collection of interaction sequences is often large and unstructured, making it challenging to uncover interaction patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics approach that integrates hierarchical clustering and process mining techniques to support analysts in exploring unstructured, large interaction sequence data. Our system employs a tailored dynamic time warpingbased similarity measure to enable comparison of interaction sequences. Based on the sequence similarities, we provide stepwise, interactive navigation of clustering results with contextual visual cues for refinement and validation. We further apply process mining to characterize derived clusters. Through these hierarchical clustering and process mining steps, analysts can progressively uncover meaningful interaction patterns while utilizing visual guidance and incorporating domain expertise. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness and applicability through two case studies involving system designers, developers, and domain experts."

However, designing incentive mechanisms that motivate ASPs to deliver high-quality AIGC services remains a challenge, especially in the presence of information asymmetry. In this paper, we address bonus design between a teleoperator and an edge ASP when the teleoperator cannot observe the ASP's private settings and chosen actions (diffusion steps). We formulate this as an online learning contract design problem and decompose it into two subproblems: ASP's settings inference and contract derivation. To tackle the NP-hard setting-inference subproblem with unknown variable sizes, we introduce a large language model (LLM)-empowered framework that iteratively refines a naive seed solver using the LLM's domain expertise. Upon obtaining the solution from the LLM-evolved solver, we directly address the contract derivation problem using convex optimization techniques and obtain a near-optimal contract.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the intelligent decision-making ability, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been extensively applied in multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) trajectory planning. This article investigates the application of DRL in Three-Dimensional (3D) trajectory planning in environments with obstacles, where multiple UAVs act as aerial Base Stations (BSs) to provide services to ground user hotspots. The existing DRL-based algorithms require a significant amount of trial and error iterations to obtain sufficiently high-performing agents. To cope with this drawback, we introduce Transfer Learning (TL) into DRL, enabling the UAV agent to possess prior knowledge upon initialization, thereby quickly adapting to unfamiliar environments and significantly improving performance. Considering the limited local observations of UAVs, a multi-modal fusion autoencoder is proposed for extracting and compressing cross-modal features from global observations to obtain the global fusion state, which enhances the perception capabilities of UAVs without incurring excessive communication overhead. Finally, we propose an exploration novelty-driven collaborative trajectory planning algorithm for multiple UAVs, which ensures obstacle avoidance and enhances the UAVs’ exploration capabilities to cover all hotspots. We adopt a probabilistic channel model and discretize both the time and DRL action space to achieve a balance between practicality and tractability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed transfer reinforcement learning method can improve the initial performance of the UAV agents by 76%. The perception and exploration-enhanced trajectory planning algorithm significantly increased the exploration efficiency and improved hotspot coverage by 50%."

    "abstract": "Metadata synchronization in multidatabase systems is a crucial process to ensure consistency, interoperability, and accurate query processing across multiple databases remotely located. Metadata refers to data about data or information about information, such as schema definitions, data types, relationships, constraints, and access policies. A global metadata catalog stores schema and mapping info. A multidatabase system enables the correct mapping and transformation of queries across systems with different remotely located schemas in case of parsing a query on a multidatabase system. It ensures proper enforcement of security policies across remotely located databases. Schema structure updates propagate from remotely located local DBs to the central repository of the multidatabase system. Each local DB manages its metadata; synchronization happens on demand. Delays in synchronizing metadata can cause outdated or incorrect operations. The research paper has practically addressed the issue of maintenance of metadata, which is also called metadata synchronization in the multidatabase systems, using a method & system comprising two different replication agent instances (complete background processes that are transparent to users) in conjunction with computer hardware, sockets, IPs, and a reliable network with proper maintenance of the above issues. We have considered homogenous, remotely located distributed databases integrating into a multidatabase system. The issue addressed is kind of new, as per the review of existing published work."

    "abstract": "High-speed water entry of the vehicle is recognized as a typical fluid-structure interaction process. Due to the abrupt change in density of the surrounding fluid medium, the vehicle is subjected to instantaneous extreme loads, which may result in damage to its shell structure and loss of control over its trajectory. To further explore the load characteristics and structural deformation during high-speed water entry, a numerical model for the high-speed water entry is established based on the Structured Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. Compared with experimental results, favorable predictive accuracy is demonstrated by this numerical model. Using this model, numerical simulations under different entry angles are conducted, and parameters such as acceleration, pressure, and stress during the water entry are systematically acquired. Additionally, the time-domain characteristics of these parameters are analyzed. It is shown by the results that axial loads are primarily borne by the vehicle during water entry, while the amplitude of normal loads is relatively small. When oblique water entry occurs, an asymmetric mechanical distribution is presented at the vehicle's head. Meanwhile, in the initial stage of water entry, alternating structural responses—specifically inward concave deformation and outward convex deformation—are exhibited at the vehicle's head."

However, the current commercial software shows poor calculation performance for such problems, urgently requiring targeted improvements to the algorithms. This paper develops a numerical simulation algorithm for transcritical flow based on the diffuse interface method. This method uses a cubic equation of state to calculate the thermophysical properties of the working fluid and solves the spurious pressure oscillation problem by calculating the flow field pressure through a pressure evolution equation. A solver program is then developed within the framework of the unstructured grid finite volume method, and simulation calculations are performed on test cases such as jet flow, swirl flow in centrifugal injector, and transverse jet flow in pintle injector to verify the simulation effectiveness of the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm and corresponding solver proposed in this paper can well capture the shear layer structure of large density gradient in transcritical flow; accurately calculate the liquid film and gas vortex structures in centrifugal injector to obtain correct swirl flow patterns; and provide reasonable predictions of the impingement behavior of two fluid streams in pintle injector, with significant improvements compared to the results from commercial software."

While this is a known result, our approach addresses the need for a more natural proof of it. We also improve on the result by achieving round preservation, and using a bounded quantity of shared randomness. We do this by showing that the communicating parties can produce a reliable estimate of the joint type, or empirical distribution, of their inputs. This estimate is then used in our protocol for the prior-free reverse Shannon theorem with side information at the receiver. These results are then generalized to the interactive setting to obtain our main result."

    "abstract": "Coded computing is a reliable and fault-tolerant mechanism for implementing large computing tasks over a distributed set of worker nodes. While a majority of coded computing frameworks address accurate computation of the target functions, they are restricted to computing multivariate polynomial functions. To generalize these computing platforms to non-polynomial target functions, Jahani-Nezhad and Maddah-Ali recently proposed Berrut Approximated Coded computing (BACC), which was proven fault-tolerant against stragglers albiet with tolerable approximation errors on the target functions. Despite these benefits, there is no formal study on the security of BACC against worker nodes which report erroneous computations. To fill this research gap, we use a coding-theoretic approach to propose Secure Berrut Approximated Coded Computing (SBACC), which is resilient to stragglers and also robust to the presence of such untrusted worker nodes. One of the highlights of SBACC is the new choice of evaluation points for distributed computation which makes the well-known Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) codes amenable to error detection and correction. To validate the new choice of evaluation points, first, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC in the absence of untrusted worker nodes. Subsequently, to handle the presence of untrusted worker nodes, we derive bounds on the accuracy of SBACC and show that interesting optimization problems can be formulated to study the trade-off between the error correcting capability of the DCT codes and the accuracy of the target computation."

Based on the conventional drag acceleration profile, the analytical solution of the range under the rotation of earth is derived, and an on-line planning algorithm of drag acceleration profile is given by combing the secant method. Simulation tests show that the predictor-corrector method proposed in this paper has good performance in altitude, speed and range control under the multiple types of interference, which can satisfy the stability requirements of reentry guidance."

Before validation, all wind sources are intercalibrated using the triple collocation methodology. Moreover, wind triplets are segregated according to the distance from the coastline in 10 km -width bins, to check the eventual presence of any residual land contamination in the retrievals. The preliminary results show that wind retrievals are high-biased for values lower than $3-4 \\mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ within 20 km from the coastline, suggesting the presence of some residual land contamination. Instead, the standard deviation of the differences between scatterometerderived and buoy winds increases by about $\\mathbf{5 0 - 7 0 \\%}$. However, scatterometer-derived winds compare better with buoys than with ERA5 winds, demonstrating higher spatial resolution and accuracy compared to model winds. Finally, the sampling does not seem to depend on the distance from the coast."

The Random Forest classification algorithm achieved high accuracy ($95 \\%$ to $99 \\%$) in classifying images, supported by a kappa coefficient of 0.85 to 0.90. Additionally, a time series model was employed, showing a mean absolute percentage error of $\\mathbf{4. 5 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{4. 9 5 \\%}$. The findings revealed dynamic changes in the coastlines of the studied regions from 2000 to 2020. Karachi experienced significant accretion at a rate of 20 meters per year from 2000 to 2006, followed by erosion of $\\mathbf{- 1 0}$ meters per year in 2014. However, the shoreline has since experienced accretion, with an annual increase of 15 meters per year until 2020. The study reveals varying trends in coastline change across different locations, with a mix of expansion and erosion. Future coastal management should address these changes and their impacts. The region experiencing positive trends, Karachi, should focus on sustainable development. Comprehensive coastal management is crucial to protect ecosystems while accommodating human activities, considering the dynamic nature of coastlines."

To address the impact of highly reflective surfaces on the accuracy of structured light measurements, this paper utilizes the RANSAC algorithm to process the scanned point clouds of highly reflective surfaces. By removing error points in the point cloud according to the shape characteristics of the scanned surface, the final measurement accuracy is improved. In the experiments, a highly reflective plane and a highly reflective spherical surface were selected as experimental objects. The measurement accuracy of flatness and the diameter of the measured sphere were compared before and after point cloud processing. The experimental results indicate that the measurement accuracy of flatness improved by 0.171mm, and the diameter measurement accuracy of the sphere improved by 0.103mm."

However, current full-space industrial DTNs face persistent challenges: neglect of propagation-impacting industrial factors, computational inefficiency, and poor generalization in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based prediction method. This demo establishes an immersive IIoT-DTNs framework for real logistics scenarios, where cargo stacking rates are considered as the primary industrial dynamic factor. Hence, the 3D scenes reflecting varying stacking rates are generated for Ray Tracing (RT)-based channel modeling. The proposed Adaptive Sampling-based Sparse RT Calculation (AdaSpRT) method strategically selects critical propagation areas for RT calculation, replacing random sampling. Then, AI-based channel prediction can be trained and fine-tuned with the RT data for remaining sample prediction. Evaluations across two distinct environments, high-density shelving vs. open layout, demonstrate 22.0% and 12.4% efficiency improvements over conventional RT while maintaining Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of 3.44 dB and 1.56 dB respectively."

IoTAgent interprets user's natural language requests to perform heterogeneous tasks such as complex question answering and real-time event triggering, by coordinating high-level task planning and low-level execution and memory management. It integrates sensor data and domain-specific expert knowledge to achieve deeper understanding of the IoT environment. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that IoTAgent enhances the quality of question answering, and reduces the latency of rule execution by up to 84.3% while balancing energy consumption."

This avoids radio frequency based localization, which is both computationally intensive and not supported in today's commercial headsets. We present VisibleBits, a proof-of-concept Light Fidelity transceiver integrated with a Meta Quest 3 that converts optical signals into a visual serial protocol, overcoming hardware limitations.

Policy atoms provide a valuable perspective on the inter-domain routing policies in the Internet. With the rapid growth and increasing complexity of the Internet since these studies, we believe it is important to reassess the implications and applicability of policy atoms. In this paper, we revisit the policy atom concept after two decades and replicate the study performed by Afek et al. to assess the current state of AS path sharing and shed light on the evolution of policy atoms. We demonstrate that the Internet still operates on the level of policy atoms rather than individual ASes, as prefixes within the same atom tend to experience changes in AS path simultaneously. We apply the concept of policy atoms in IPv6 and find that this observation also holds true for IPv6 prefixes. We also relate trends in the characteristics of policy atoms with the development of inter-domain routing policies. We highlight new insights generated by the perspective of policy atoms and their potential for further applications. Our code is publicly available to support reproducibility and to encourage future research on this topic."

However, existing CNN-based and Transformer-based methods struggle to balance computational efficiency and detection accuracy, particularly in capturing global contextual relationships and fine-grained features of small ships. To address these challenges, we propose GLMFNet, a novel Lightweight Global-Local Multi-Scale Fusion Network for Small Ship Detection. GLMFNet propose a lightweight backbone, GL-HVSS, which employs the Neighbor 2D-Selective-Scan (NS2D) to dynamically capture spatial-semantic correlations. This mechanism preserves ship continuity in complex maritime scenes while efficiently modeling global information. Furthermore, to amplify the saliency of tiny ships, we design the Micro-SimAm Block, which precisely accentuates the edge and texture details of vessels without incurring any additional parameters or computational overhead. Finally, the Multi-scale Auxiliary Hierarchical Fusion Block (AHFB) embeds intrinsic multi-scale feature fusion, markedly enhancing localization accuracy while simultaneously optimizing parameter efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the Kaggle and FAIR1M marine ship detection datasets demonstrate that GLMFNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy while maintaining a lightweight structure."

    "abstract": "The wake effect may reduce the received wind speeds by the wind turbines (WTs), leading to degraded performance in power system frequency support. Existing researches only consider the impact of single-directional wake effect on the WT's frequency support ability, neglecting the scenarios of non-array formed wind farm where the wake effect might be multi-directional. Out of this consideration, this paper proposes an optimal energy storage system sizing (OES) scheme to mitigate the impact of multi-directional wake (MDW) effect on the WT's frequency support performance. Firstly, we consider the scenario of none-array formed WF layout, and develop the MDW effect model which incorporates 8 characteristic wind directions to assess the reduction of the received wind speed by the WTs. Subsequently, the impact of MDW effect on the WTs' frequency support margin (FSM) is evaluated based on the grid synchronization characteristic curves. Meanwhile, the WTs are divided into separate clusters based on their FSM via fuzzy K-means algorithm. Afterwards, the OES scheme is proposed, which tries to maximize the coherency level among different WTs in their FSM by optimally allocating ESSs in each cluster. Ultimately, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed OES scheme is validated via simulations and comparative study."

In parallel, security and privacy are essential requirements for future IoT deployments. Thus, taking effective measures to address security concerns in complex IoT networks is evolving into a valuable research topic. Driven by these demands, we investigate the physical layer security robust resource allocation issue in cooperative relay-assisted integrated communication and over-the-air computation networks for IoT applications. Moreover, we consider a practical scenario where only imperfect channel state information is available. To guarantee the communication security between IoT sensors and the legitimate base station, we propose to jointly design the transmit and receive processing factors, along with relay amplification coefficients. Specifically, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that maximizes the sum achievable secrecy rate, subject to transmit power constraints at sensors and relays, as well as the maximal tolerable computation error constraint of the legitimate base station. Subsequently, to address the intractably robust non-convex problem, we propose an efficient generalize Lagrangian dual transform based algorithm with cutting-set method. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, two benchmark algorithms are considered. The first is the weighted minimum mean square error based algorithm that incorporates the cutting-set method, while the second is the conservative approximation based algorithm. In comparison to the former, our proposed algorithm demonstrates faster convergence; in relation to the latter, it obtains superior performance."

    "abstract": "London's famous \"tube map\" is an iconic piece of design and perhaps represents the schematic visualization style most well-known to the general public: its octolinearity has become the de facto standard for transit maps around the world. Making a good schematic transit map is challenging and labour-intensive, and has attracted the attention of the optimization community. Much of the literature has focused on mathematically defining an optimal drawing and algorithms to compute one. However, achieving these \"optimal\" layouts is computationally challenging, often requiring multiple minutes of runtime. Crucially, what it means for a map to be good is actually highly dependent on factors that evade a general formal definition, like unique landmarks within the network, the context in which a map will be displayed, and the preference of the designer and client. Rather than attempting to make an algorithm that produces a single high-quality and ready-to-use metro map at great cost, we propose it is more fruitful to support rapid layout iteration by a human designer, providing a workflow that enables efficient exploration of a wider range of designs than could be done by hand, and iterating on these designs. To this end we identify steps in the design process of schematic maps that are tedious to do by hand but are algorithmically feasible, and present a framework around a simple linear program that computes network layouts almost instantaneously given a fixed direction for every connection. These connection directions are decided by a designer in a graphical user interface with several interaction methods and a number of quality-of-life features demonstrating the flexibility of the framework; the implementation is available as open source."

    "abstract": "Constructing cell developmental trajectories is a critical task in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, enabling the inference of potential cellular progression paths. However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Vision-language (VL) models have shown transformative potential across various critical domains due to their capability to comprehend multi-modal information. However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task."

    "abstract": "We present the Critical Design Strategy (CDS)—a structured method designed to facilitate the examination of visualisation designs through reflection and critical thought. The CDS helps designers think critically and make informed improvements using heuristic evaluation. When developing a visual tool or pioneering a novel visualisation approach, identifying areas for enhancement can be challenging. Critical thinking is particularly crucial for visualisation designers and tool developers, especially those new to the field, such as studying visualisation in higher education. The CDS consists of three stages across six perspectives: Stage 1 captures the essence of the idea by assigning an indicative title and selecting five adjectives (from twenty options) to form initial impressions of the design. Stage 2 involves an in-depth critique using 30 heuristic questions spanning six key perspectives—user, environment, interface, components, design, and visual marks. Stage 3 focuses on synthesising insights, reflecting on design decisions, and determining the next steps forward. We introduce the CDS and explore its use across three visualisation modules in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Our longstanding experience with the CDS has allowed us to refine and develop it over time: from its initial creation through workshops in 2017/18 to improvements in wording and the development of two applications by 2020, followed by the expansion of support notes and refinement of heuristics through 2023; while using it in our teaching each year. This sustained use allows us to reflect on its practical application and offer guidance on how others can incorporate it into their own work."

To address these challenges, we introduce TactiVis, a visual analytics system designed for analyzing combat decision-making behavior. Using MOBA game as a representative case of team-based combat, TactiVis adopts a macro-to-micro tactics visual analytics framework consisting of three stages: match-level analysis, event-level understanding, and character-level comparison.

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of mechanical equipment, Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD) has become crucial for ensuring production safety and efficiency, but the inherent opacity in decision-making processes limits practical applications. Therefore, this article proposes Wavelet-kernel Deformable-convolution Attention CNN (WDACNN) to enhance the physical interpretability and IFD accuracy. Firstly, learnable Discrete Wavelet Kernel Convolution (DWKConv) is proposed to decompose signals, integrating wavelet physics with data-driven parameter optimization, and dual-path constraints are deduced to ensure the dynamic updating of the wavelet kernel. Secondly, 1-D Deformable Convolution (1-D DeConv) is designed for versatile-scale fault impulse feature extraction, enabling the adjustment of the receptive field and precise localization of features. Further, Multi-scale Feature Fusion Attention Module (MFF-AM) is proposed to adaptively balance local details and global trends, dynamically fusing cross-scale features from wavelet decomposition to enhance feature representation. Extensive experiments on two bearing fault datasets demonstrate that WDACNN achieves superior diagnostic accuracy and robust stability, confirming its effectiveness in IFD. From several aspects, theoretical analysis combined with feature map visualization provides conclusive evidence for the enhanced interpretability of the proposed WDACNN."

    "abstract": "The line-of-sight (LOS) requirement of free-space optical (FSO) systems can be relaxed by employing optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In this paper, we show that an IRS-assisted FSO system employing a square-law photo detector (PD) receiver can be modeled as a linear end-to-end system if the receiver lens area is sufficiently large. Based on this linear model, we characterize the impact of IRS-induced delay dispersion and derive an analytical expression for the corresponding channel impulse response (CIR), which reveals the dependence of the end-to-end channel on the characteristics of the incident and reflected beams’ wavefronts, the position of transmitter and receiver, the size and phase shift profile of the IRS, and the incident beamwidth on the IRS. For transmission, we consider an on-off keying (OOK) and a DC-clipped optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) system. Our simulation results reveal that a maximum effective delay spread of 0.7 ns is expected for in-plane reflection from a square IRS with an area of 1 m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, which induces ISI for bit rates larger than 10 Gbps. We show that while the maximum delay spread is approximately independent of the IRS phase shift profile, the received power for focusing and quadratic phase shift profiles is larger than that for linear phase shift profiles. We also show that the IRS-induced delay dispersion can be mitigated by equalization at the receiver. Our results reveal that DCO-OFDM performs better than OOK modulation with zero forcing linear equalization (ZF-LE), whereas OOK modulation with decision feedback equalization (DFE) always outperforms DCO-OFDM."

    "abstract": "No-Insulation (NI) coil utilizing HTS tape conductor has become a promising option for high-field magnets, capable of delivering both excellent thermal stability and high current density. NI coil can reduce heat generation due to a current behavior that bypasses the defect when a local hot-spot is formed in HTS tape conductor. In the high-field magnet application, a coil structure with large number of bundled HTS tape conductors without insulation between layers is utilized to achieve large current capacity. In this paper, the authors examine numerically the current behavior of NI coils under sudden open-circuit conditions with varying numbers of bundled tape conductors. Additionally, a thermal analysis of the NI coil was performed to evaluate the effect of current behavior on thermal transient response. The partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) model was employed to analyze the NI coil made of bundled HTS tape conductors. In this model, each turn of the coil and its corresponding loop section are divided and represented as an electrical circuit. This method allows for a thorough analysis of the current and temperature distribution within the NI coil. The calculation results of current behavior under the shutdown of the power supply to the coil revealed that the circumferential current concentrated in innermost and outermost layers, which results in heat generation in the NI coil. Also, temperature rise due to the current imbalance under power shutdown condition tends to become higher when the number of bundled tape conductors increases."

    "abstract": "Hard shoulder running is a freeway traffic control strategy that temporarily converts shoulders into travel lanes to increase the roadway capacity during peak hours. Such hard shoulder running sections may terminate at deceleration lanes. In cases where the deceleration lane is a single lane, two exiting traffic streams, one from the rightmost general-purpose lane and the other from the shoulder, must merge onto a single lane. If not properly controlled, such merging activities could potentially result in excessive congestion, especially when exiting volumes are high. Hence, this study proposes an Integrated Proactive Hard Shoulder Running control system to mitigate such potential congestion with hard shoulder running, advisory messages for executing lane changes, and ramp controls to meter the upstream entry flows. The merging impacts of exiting flows on the mainline traffic assessed in the proposed system are estimated with a customized macroscopic traffic model to best preserve the benefits of hard shoulder running while addressing the associated negative impacts. The system’s evaluation first starts with using extensive field data on different days from a Taiwan freeway section to confirm the model’s effectiveness with respect to reduction in congestion and emissions, then followed by extensive performance analyses under various driver compliance rates to the posted lane-changing advisory message. Additionally, multiple commonly used surrogate safety measures are employed to evaluate the proposed system. All analysis results demonstrate that the proposed system for hard shoulder running can indeed yield the expected benefits of reducing delays and emissions, while increasing safety and throughput."

    "abstract": "Network traffic classification (NTC) plays an essential role in managing, securing, and optimizing networks. Supervised learning methods face challenges such as label scarcity. Given that network traffic contains sensitive data and is distributed across multiple nodes, privacy-aware and scalable approaches are necessary for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce FedSSL-NTC, a privacy-enhancing federated framework that integrates self-supervised learning (SSL) and a traffic-adapted confident learning (CL) approach. In FedSSL-NTC, clients locally pretrain SSL models (Autoencoders or Tabular Contrastive Learning) and generate pseudo-labels. CL is then applied on the client side to reduce pseudo-label noise before federated classifier training. Robustness to non-independently and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data and class imbalance is achieved via FedProx, class-weighted loss, and a sample-size weighted FedAvg aggregation method. This framework uses Secure Aggregation to protect individual updates. On a self-generated + ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset and the UCDavis–QUIC dataset, FedSSL-NTC achieves 95.88% and 98.24% accuracy (vs. centralized 96.29% and 98.76%), while reducing training time by approximately 4–5× through parallel client updates. The method outperforms recent federated/self-supervised baselines on the same evaluation protocol (e.g., 6% improvement compared to FS-GAN). Therefore, FedSSL-NTC offers a practical path to high-accuracy NTC under privacy constraints, non-IID distributions, and label scarcity."

High-speed cameras were used to capture images of the zero-zone process of vacuum arcs under transverse magnetic fields, flat contacts, and different commutation gaps. Spectrometers were employed to collect characteristic spectral lines at Cu I 521.8 nm, from which electron temperature and electron density were calculated and analyzed. The study found that under the same operating condition with a commutation gap of 6 mm, the swastika-shaped transverse magnetic field (TMF) contacts can effectively regulate the spatial distribution of arc plasma. Compared with the case without magnetic field, the radial distribution uniformity of electron density is significantly improved, and the ratio of electron density between the center and the edge on the cathode contact surface decreases from 7:1 to 1.6:1. Increasing the contact gap can improve the spatial distribution uniformity of electron density. The transverse magnetic field gap (6 mm) and increasing the contact gap (10 mm) under no magnetic field conditions have equivalent regulatory effects on the radial/axial distribution of electron density. Both increasing the gap and enhancing the magnetic field improve the uniformity of plasma spatial distribution and reduce the difference in electron density between the center and edge of the contact surface. The transverse magnetic field can equivalently replace increasing the gap to achieve stable arc control."

Since the useful data is correlated with the private data X, the agent uses a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data U that can be released. We assume that the agent observes Y and has no direct access to X, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study the privacy mechanism design that maximizes the revealed information about Y while satisfying a bounded Local Information Privacy (LIP) criterion. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. By utilizing this approximation the main privacy-utility trade-off problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we provide lower bounds on it. In contrast to the previous works that have complexity issues, here, we provide simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix. To do so, we follow two approaches where in the first one we find a lower bound on the main problem and then approximate it, however, in the second approach we approximate the main problem directly.In this work, we present geometrical studies of the proposed methods and in a numerical example we compare our results considering both approaches with the optimal solution and the previous methods. Finally, we discuss how the proposed methods can be applied to deal with differential privacy."

Deep learning models have shown promise in medical image classification. However, challenges such as class imbalance in datasets and lack of model interpretability affect the effectiveness of dementia diagnosis. A significant imbalance between healthy and dementia affected images lead to biased performance. Additionally, the functioning of a deep learning model is viewed as a black box, which limits its clinical adoption. This research aims to improve dementia classification and model interpretability by addressing the aforementioned limitations. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is utilized for synthetic data augmentation to balance the dataset. Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is used to visualize the decision of the model. The Visual Geometry Group (VGG) - 16 based classifier is trained on a combined dataset (original + augmented) using categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam Optimizer. Performance of the classifier is evaluated through accuracy, precision, and recall. Similarly, the quality of the image is assessed through Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Results indicate a significant improvement in classification accuracy with combined data yielding 95.63% validation accuracy when compared to $85.20 \\%$ on the original dataset. Similarly, SSIM and FID scores prove the effectiveness of DCGAN-generated images in enhancing data diversity. The critical brain regions are highlighted through Grad-CAM, which proves the transparency of the model. These findings prove that integrating synthetic data augmentation and explainability techniques enhances both accuracy and interpretability in dementia diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) form a critical component of the security infrastructure in Software-Defined Networks (SDN). However, they often need to strike a balance between high detection accuracy, real-time responsiveness, and adaptability. Furthermore, traditional IDS that operate at the controller level suffer from centralized bottlenecks and high false alarms for evolving threats. Thus, edge-assisted approaches have been proposed to alleviate some of these drawbacks. While emerging quantum-enhanced strategies can be employed to accelerate this process, this would require specialized hardware at the edge devices, which is either impractical or too cost-prohibitive. In this work, we apply Classical Client Quantum Federated Learning (CC-QFL) to adaptive resource-constrained SDN nodes that use classical shadow tomography to offload quantum model training and aggregation to a centralized quantum controller. The overhead of periodic retraining is significantly reduced and inference requires $0.1 \\mu$ s per instance. CC-QFL is evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset consisting of 1,048,576 instances, achieving $83.2 \\%$ accuracy, $86 \\%$ precision, $95 \\%$ recall, and a $91 \\%$ F1-score. It takes only 2.8 ms per round to train, which is several orders of magnitude faster than conventional deep learning IDS. These results reveal that in dynamic SDN environments, CC-QFL provides ultra-low latency, scalable, and robust intrusion detection, opening up possibilities for quantum-driven enhancements in the responsiveness of SDN controllers."

By enabling simultaneous bi-directional communication and leveraging multiple spatial layers with index-modulated antenna-symbol mapping, the proposed system supports highthroughput transmission. A dynamic antenna selection strategy ensures conflict-free layered transmission, while PNC is employed at the FD relay to combine received messages via XOR operations for efficient broadcast. We develop a comprehensive system, accounting for residual self-interference (RSI) and analyze performance through Monte Carlo simulations. Results demonstrate that TWR FD-LGSM PNC outperforms existing TWR FD-SM and TWR FD-GSM schemes in bit error rate (BER) performance, especially under limited hardware and imperfect SI cancellation, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation spectrally-efficient MIMO systems."

Specimens are printed utilizing composite fused filament fabrication (FFF). By integrating theoretical modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), and experimental method, this study verifies the efficacy of the approach in achieving superior mechanical properties along targeted orientations. The lattices exhibit significant improvements over the stretch-dominated Octet+Cubic lattice, with specific stiffness, specific strength, and specific energy absorption (SEA) enhanced by 105.0%, 154.2%, and 115.1%, respectively. The mechanical performance of these designs surpasses those of most recently reported lattices. In certain cases, the relative strength even exceeds the empirical upper limit predicted by the Gibson-Ashby model. This study presents a novel paradigm for the anisotropic design of high-performance architected materials."

Data in submerged areas are acquired at the $1: 25,000$ scale, by indirect surveys carried out by geophysical methods and must be groundtruthed by samplings, video inspections or scuba diving. Information to be represented on the geological maps refers to the distribution of deposits cropping out on the seafloor. Bathymetric data for the CARG Project are provided by the Hydrographic Institute of the Navy (IIMM) through the Geological Survey of Italy. Acoustic facies are interpreted by means of groundtruthing as the units cropping out on the seafloor, which are represented according to the standards of the geological map of Italy. Each type of information is classified according to the guidelines and is stored in a geological database at 1:25,000 scale, called BDG - Banca Dati Geologica. The CARG database is continuously updated and provide the opportunity to be implemented with new features and attributes as needed. Maps and the accompanying explanatory notes are available online as rasters and in digital format on the CARG-GATE platform (//progetto-carg.isprambiente.it/).

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/isncc66965.2025.11250506",

    "abstract": "Due to the open nature of wireless channels, wireless networks are susceptible to various physical layer security threats, including interference from jamming attacks. Such jamming attacks may adversely affect communication and diminish the reliability of receiving essential data and commands. Such communication reliability is crucial when an operator controls mobile objects, as a reduction in the reliability of getting commands or information might lead to drastic consequences. Specifically, we consider a communication center equipped with multiple antennas to communicate with a group of receivers (say, drones) performing missions in separate zones. In each zone for its protection, a jammer is installed to disrupt the communication of the communication center with the corresponding receiver. As a metric of communication reliability, we consider the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver. Since designing an anti-jamming strategy in such a hostile environment involves different agents, such as the communication center and the jammers, each with its own objectives, the problem is modeled within a game-theoretic framework. Traditionally, in such a background, the anti-jamming strategy aims to maximize the total SINR or throughput among all the receivers. A con of such a traditional approach is that, due to limited resources, the communication center might have to sacrifice communication with some receivers to maximize the total communication. This could compromise the joint mission as the receivers (drones) might face a lack of data. Motivated by this observation, we suggest using the minimal SINR among all the receivers as a communication metric for the group of receivers. This metric reflects the guaranteed reliability of communication with each receiver. In particular, we derive and illustrate an anti-jamming strategy in the most critical scenario for the communication node, where the communication node is unaware of the exact locations of the jammers but only their distributions, whereas the jammers know their location exactly."

To overcome multidimensional constraints such as fuel efficiency, path-dependent dynamic pressure limits, and terminal precise transition, a two-stage reentry framework is proposed. First, the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) is employed to generate the fuel-optimal trajectory by discretizing the nonlinear dynamics into a nonlinear programming problem; second, a model predictive control (MPC) strategy is designed to track the optimized reentry trajectory while accommodating disturbances and time-varying nonlinear dynamics. Numerical simulations will validate the proposed algorithm."

The stealth effect of the optimal - formula coating was tested with a thermal infrared imager. Results show that the coating's infrared emissivity decreases with more aluminum powder. However, when over 30% aluminum powder is added, adhesion weakens. At 30% aluminum powder content, the coating has good physical and infrared - stealth properties."

    "abstract": "In the realm of aerospace engineering, accurately simulating the complex motion states of aerospace vehicles during ground tests is of paramount importance for ensuring their safety and performance. Owing to the duality between serial and parallel mechanisms, six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) parallel motion simulators have emerged as a crucial tool in this field, offering unique motion control characteristics that are highly beneficial for aerospace vehicle ground test simulations. Traditional control methods typically control the driving mechanisms of the six-degree-of-freedom motion simulator separately, without integrating the system structural information contained in the simulator's dynamic model into the controller design. To address this issue, this paper proposes a nonlinear adaptive control strategy based on inverse dynamic compensation. This strategy is designed through virtual control input and by employing the Backstepping method, introduces the dynamic properties of the simulator and the dynamic characteristics of the driving mechanism into the controller design, thereby overcoming the influence of model parameter uncertainties on system performance. Simulation results validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the control method, demonstrating its potential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of 6-DOF parallel motion simulators in aerospace vehicle ground test simulations."

However, the intermediate paths of email delivery have received little attention. In particular, the vulnerabilities and centralization of email intermediate paths have already posed real-world security threats. This paper conducts the first systematic analysis of intermediate paths of email delivery, aiming to understand dependence patterns and characterize the centralization. In collaboration with a large email service provider, we collected Received headers from email reception logs spanning nine months and reconstructed the complete intermediate paths of 105M clean emails. Our results reveal that Microsoft is the dominant provider of intermediate paths, participating in 66.4% of emails. We find that 86.9M (82.7%) emails rely on third-party providers in intermediate paths, and 9.1M (8.7%) paths involve multiple providers. Email signature providers frequently appear in cross-vendor intermediate paths. In addition, we reveal significant differences in the regional dependencies and centralization of email intermediate paths across countries and continents. The centralization observed in email intermediate paths also differs from incoming and outgoing servers. We hope our work prompts more attention to email intermediate paths to enhance the security of the email ecosystem."

To avoid accessing raw sensor data directly, FSC leverages processed semantic and kinematic information to anticipate channel conditions and proactively compute beamforming parameters ahead of time. Tested in realistic driving datasets, FSC improves signal strength by up to 15 dB. FSC bridges the gap between autonomous perception and robust communication, enabling proactive, low-latency, and energy-efficient connectivity."

    "abstract": "The prosperity of Ethereum gives rise to a new type of transaction-based phishing scam. Specifically, users are tempted to visit phishing websites and sign phishing transactions that allow scammers to withdraw their tokens. Meanwhile, to accelerate the deployment of phishing websites, scammers have introduced a business model, Drainer-as-a-Service (DaaS). In this model, drainer operators focus on crafting specialized phishing toolkits, named ''wallet drainers'', while drainer affiliates handle the deployment and promotion of phishing websites. After stealing victims' tokens, they will distribute profits. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of DaaS on Ethereum. To begin with, we propose a snowball sampling approach to build the first large-scale DaaS dataset, including 1,910 profit sharing contracts, 56 operator accounts, 6,087 affiliate accounts, and 87,077 profit-sharing transactions. Then, we analyze the scale of DaaS from the perspectives of victims, operators, and affiliates, and perform clustering analysis to uncover dominant DaaS families. Finally, we reported DaaS accounts in the dataset and 32,819 phishing websites deployed with DaaS toolkits to the community. Our work aims to serve as a guide for Ethereum service providers to enhance user protection against DaaS."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust, energy-efficient multi-user OFDM chaotic vector cyclic shift keying (MU-OFDM-CVCSK) system for channels impaired by multi-user interference (MUI), Gaussian, and impulsive noise. The system’s co-designed transceiver uses cyclic shifts of a single reference signal for energy efficiency, while a novel receiver combines low-rank matrix factorization with a truncated-quadratic loss function to suppress both MUI and noise. In particular, the transmitted signal’s cyclical structure enables iterative reference refinement, further enhancing performance. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm’s convergence, complexity, energy efficiency, power spectral density, peak-to-average power ratio, and derive the bit error rate (BER) expressions. Simulations demonstrate superior BER performance compared to benchmark schemes in challenging interference and noise conditions."

    "abstract": "Continuous minimally invasive cardiac output (CO) measurement via photoplethysmography (PPG) has received much attention in daily monitoring. However, the precision of current research is not suitable for the clinical measurement of CO. Therefore, a novel cardiac output quantification model is proposed that adopts esophageal PPG signals for clinical monitoring. Based on this model, a continuous CO quantification instrument is made and an experiment is designed to obtain the training and testing data set of the model. The experimental data set consists of 421 paired observations. These observations are from the esophageal PPG data obtained with the custom-made instrument and PICCO (Pulse Index Continuous Cardiac Output) data obtained with a commercial instrument in seven pigs. In the proposed model, a deep learning algorithm is designed for CO quantification. A four-layer perceptron model is developed based on a mathematical analysis of 24 features from the experimental data set. Meanwhile, the best wavelength, 940 nm, is determined to improve the prediction quality via the random forest model. The custom-made continuous CO quantification instrument, evaluated with a ten-fold cross-validation, demonstrates a correlation coefficient of 0.934, indicating a high predictive precision. The consistency of the instrument is verified through Bland-Altman analysis, and the results show a Percentage Error (PE) of 0.0803 and a Percentage of estimates within consistency limit (PEI) of 0.965, indicating good consistency."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of space-based services has established Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks as a promising option for global broadband connectivity. Next-generation LEO networks leverage inter-satellite links (ISLs) to provide faster and more reliable communications compared to traditional bent-pipe architectures, even in remote regions. However, the high mobility of satellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose significant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these challenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph comprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each satellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to neighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal solutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and uncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed learning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK enables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions, ensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and resilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead and computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global scale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For 25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop rate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to Dijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99% relative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while achieving up to 46% higher throughput. At the same time, SKYLINK maintains constant computational complexity with respect to constellation size."

Therefore, ancillary services are introduced to stabilize the grid and dampen RES-induced fluctuations. To comply with the directives of the Australian energy market operator (AEMO), this paper proposes a novel strategy that enables virtual power plants (VPPs) comprising solar, wind, and battery storage systems to engage in both energy and Australian ancillary services, encompassing two regulations and six contingency services. Additionally, to address uncertainties, a robust and time-efficient technique is used that is compatible with the dynamic nature of ancillary service provisions. The proposed model is evaluated through case studies using a range of battery storage systems introduced by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization (CSIRO), along with real-world cases from Victoria, Australia. Results demonstrate that VPP participation in both energy and ancillary service markets yields a 19.31% higher profit compared to the energy market alone."

    "abstract": "Traditional elevator group control systems face limitations in terms of response speed, passenger recognition, and safety. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent real-time monitoring and safety dispatch model based on biometric data analysis. At the perception layer, a You Only Look Once (YOLO) recognition network integrated with the Ghost module and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is constructed. This hybrid architecture aims to achieve high-precision recognition of special passengers, such as wheelchair users and baby strollers. At the scheduling layer, a multi-objective optimization function is designed that considers passenger waiting time, energy consumption, and service fairness. Additionally, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is enhanced via Ant Colony Optimization to implement differentiated, adaptive elevator dispatch strategies. At the control and simulation layer, various elevator usage scenarios are simulated using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal platform to evaluate the system’s response efficiency and safety. At the control and simulation layer, various elevator usage scenarios are simulated using a PLC and the TIA Portal platform to evaluate system response effectiveness. Experimental results on the Visual Object Classes 2007 dataset demonstrate that the proposed YOLO-World-Ghost-CBAM biometric recognition model achieves the highest accuracy for identifying special passengers. Specifically, it reaches a 97.4% recognition accuracy for wheelchair users, representing a 5.1% improvement over the YOLO-World-Ghost model; a 95.6% accuracy for baby strollers, improving by 6.5%; 10.7% over the YOLO-World model, and 18.9% over the conventional YOLOv8 model. Compared with other scheduling models, the GNN model optimized via the ant colony algorithm performs consistently well across various scenarios. Under simulation condition A, it achieves optimal scheduling with the shortest time cost (20.73s) and the lowest energy consumption (33,807.5J). Under conditions B and C, it also maintains high scheduling efficiency with relatively low time costs (24.72s and 35.18s) and energy consumption (32,067.6J and 37,801.7J), validating the effectiveness and generalization capability of Ant Colony Optimization in multi-objective scheduling. This study innovatively integrates biometric recognition with intelligent scheduling, offering a safer, more efficient, and user-centric elevator system solution for smart building environments."

    "abstract": "We investigate whether tactile charts support comprehension and learning of complex visualizations for blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals and contribute four tactile chart designs and an interview study. Visualizations are powerful tools for conveying data, yet BLV individuals typically can rely only on assistive technologies—primarily alternative texts—to access this information. Prior research shows the importance of mental models of chart types for interpreting these descriptions, yet BLV individuals have no means to build such a mental model based on images of visualizations. Tactile charts show promise to fill this gap in supporting the process of building mental models. Yet studies on tactile data representations mostly focus on simple chart types, and it is unclear whether they are also appropriate for more complex charts as would be found in scientific publications. Working with two BLV researchers, we designed 3D-printed tactile template charts with exploration instructions for four advanced chart types: UpSet plots, violin plots, clustered heatmaps, and faceted line charts. We then conducted an interview study with 12 BLV participants comparing whether using our tactile templates improves mental models and understanding of charts and whether this understanding translates to novel datasets experienced through alt texts. Thematic analysis shows that tactile models support chart type understanding and are the preferred learning method by BLV individuals. We also report participants' opinions on tactile chart design and their role in BLV education."

We propose a novel blocked QR decomposition algorithm for condensing MPC problems in a numerically robust manner. The method is applicable when the system dynamics, described by either linear or linearized models, are time-invariant over the prediction horizon. The method effectively handles unstable dynamics and exhibits numerical convergence properties that result in an asymptotically <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">constant</i> computational complexity regardless of the horizon length.

We offer a fundamental rethinking of VO robustness as a training-schedule problem rather than an architectural challenge, introducing a novel dual-paradigm curriculum learning framework that operates at both trajectory and loss-component levels. (i) A motion-based curriculum orders trajectories by measured motion complexity. (ii) A hierarchical component curriculum adaptively re-weights optical-flow, pose, and rotation losses via Self-Paced and in-training Reinforcement Learning (RL) schedulers. Integrated into an unmodified DPVO baseline, these strategies cut TartanAir ATE by 33% with only 31% extra training wall-time, and reach baseline accuracy 47% faster (Self-Paced). Without fine-tuning, the same models improve zero-shot performance on EuRoC (13% ATE reduction), TUM-RGBD (9%; 46% on dynamic scenes), KITTI (21%), and ICL-NUIM (32%). We show that explicit difficulty progression or adaptive loss weighting provides a practical, zero-inference-overhead path to robust monocular VO and could extend to other geometric vision tasks."

    "abstract": "Continuum robots (CRs) show great potential in complex environments due to their excellent deformability. For practical applications, the position control of the CRs is an important research field. The common drives of the CRs are rigid motors with mature control schemes. However, the driving force of the rigid motors is often impactive, which may cause safety concerns during interaction. Soft drives based on pneumatic soft actuators (PSAs) can provide compliant driving force for the CRs robot bodies to solve this problem, but it is necessary to comprehensively consider the control of the soft drives and the robot bodies. This article takes a CR with soft drives as the research objective, and proposes a double closed-loop adaptive position control method to achieve the endpoint position control of the CR. This CR includes a length-variable robot body with millimeter-scale diameter and pneumatic soft drives. The kinematic model of the robot body is built based on the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) method, and the static models of the soft drives are derived from the three-element model. Based on these models, we propose a double closed-loop adaptive position control method. The inner loop is used to control the displacements of the soft drives, and the outer loop combines the endpoint position control with the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode function to adaptively control the endpoint position based on the inner loop. By Lyapunov method, we prove the convergence of the endpoint position error. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified through experiments."

    "abstract": "To address the surge in wireless traffic, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has become essential for advancing communication systems. Within MIMO cellular networks, coordinated beamforming (CBF), achieved through the collaborative design of beamformers across multiple base stations (BSs), presents a promising strategy for enhancing network performance. However, in large-scale multi-cell, multi-user MIMO environments, optimizing beamforming coordination remains challenging due to high-dimensional spaces and dynamic conditions. While centralized, optimization-based CBF algorithms provide near-optimal solutions, their dependence on real-time global channel state information (CSI) and high computational complexity renders them impractical for dynamic networks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a diffusion model-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) coordinated beamforming framework, termed Diffusion-enhanced MACBF, which enables BSs to determine optimal beamformers independently based on partial observations. Key innovations of this framework include: firstly, a novel limited-information exchange protocol that facilitates effective coordination among BSs with minimal communication overhead; secondly, the introduction of a diffusion model-enhanced Multi-agent Soft Actor-Critic (MASAC) algorithm that enables BSs to efficiently manage spatial and temporal variations in large-scale scenarios; and thirdly, an optimized network architecture combining an Encoder, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers to accurately map partial observations to optimal actions. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, achieving an average rate of 7.5502 bps/Hz with up to 10.66% improvement over existing methods while significantly reducing information exchange requirements."

    "abstract": "Search engines serve as primary gateways to information, and users tend to trust them, despite being algorithmic black boxes and customizing results in non-transparent ways. Personalization, such as tailoring content based on a user’s location, is useful for routine content searches (e.g., finding nearby restaurants). However, this same personalization becomes problematic - and potentially harmful - when users seek information on sensitive or contentious geopolitical topics. In this work, we present the first large-scale measurement of how search engine curation and personalization affect users across different countries with distinct regional, political, and cultural traits. We developed a novel, privacy-preserving, bot-based methodology that simulates online user profiles embedded with cumulative regional traits. These customized bots were deployed from different locations and conducted identical searches, either on the Israel-Palestine conflict (e.g. “Hamas”) or neutral queries (e.g. “dinner recipe”), using both Google and DuckDuckGo. Our study addresses two main questions: (1) How do search results for the same query differ across countries, and which factors drive these differences?; and (2) Does personalization vary more significantly for conflict-related or for general queries? Our findings show that search result rankings are significantly influenced by location, interface language, and simulated browsing context, with the strongest effects observed for conflict-related queries. In many cases, these differences led to non-neutral portrayals of the same event, depending on the user’s presumed region. These results highlight how search engine personalization can shape public understanding of global events, creating fragmented or biased informational environments. This underscores the importance of educating users about the invisible filters that influence their access to information and, from a policy standpoint, these findings reveal a pressing need for greater transparency and accountability in how search engines personalize politically sensitive content. This is especially urgent given their outsized role in shaping democratic discourse and public opinion worldwide."

Compared to conventional Radar, 4D Radar offers enhanced elevation information, facilitating the generation of 3D point cloud akin to LiDAR. However, the inherent sparsity and high noise level of 4D Radar data make direct adaptation of LiDAR-based registration methods ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose Radar Voxelized Generalized Iterative Closest Point (RVGICP) algorithm for efficient and rapid point cloud registration. First, we introduce a dual-stage initial pose estimation module. To robustly handle large inter-scan displacements, it leverages Doppler velocity for an initial translation estimate. Complementing this, an efficient rotation estimation method based on point cloud histograms is proposed to accelerate convergence and mitigate the risk of local minima. Second, we extend the voxelized generalized iterative closest point (VGICP) algorithm by performing voxelization in the polar coordinates, enabling adaptive resolution for voxel matching. Third, a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ 3^{3}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-neighbors set based voxel covariance estimation model is proposed, which better characterizes local geometric properties and avoids computationally nearest neighbor search.

The methodology overcomes highly dynamic, strongly coupled, and uncertain flight conditions through three critical advancements: 1) Development of a global dynamic model via multi-dimensional constraint mapping across motion, attitude, and temporal domains; 2) Integration of neural networks with a composite disturbance observer that simultaneously compensates for aerodynamic uncertainties, network approximation errors, and input matrix deviations; 3) Derivation of a finite-time convergent control law guaranteeing precise command signal tracking. Mathematical simulations validate the framework's effectiveness in resolving cross-domain flight control challenges, confirming robust disturbance rejection across the specified operational envelope."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of cooperative control for UAV swarms in complex wind field environments by proposing a hybrid control method that integrates dynamic role assignment and adaptive disturbance rejection. Inspired by the autonomous leader-switching behavior in migrating geese, a distributed architecture is developed based on local neighbor information exchange. The leading UAVs are dynamically selected based on energy consumption and tracking error, while follower UAVs employ an improved PID controller for trajectory tracking. To counteract unknown wind disturbances, an online gradient-based disturbance observer is developed with an error-dependent learning rate to avoid chattering, a common issue in traditional sliding mode control. Two levels of simulation are conducted for validation: First, Python-based numerical si mulations are used to verify the core logic with particle dynamics and stochastic wind fields; second, rigid-body dynamics simulations are conducted in PyBullet using open-source UAV models to demonstrate feasibility. Results show that under wind speeds of 15 m/s (equivalent to Beaufort scale 7), the proposed method maintains a formation tracking error within 0.3 m for a swarm of ten UAVs, while reducing communication load to 40% of conventional methods. This provides a viable cooperative control solution for UAV swarms in high-disturbance environments."

However, this encryption and encapsulation pose challenges for kernel-level network and security monitoring. To address this, we present LinkQUIC, the first heuristic-based system that identifies and classifies QUIC traffic at both kernel-space endpoints and middleboxes. LinkQUIC analyzes unencrypted QUIC header fields and leverages gaps in existing QUIC implementations, particularly during connection migration and path changes where behavior does not fully comply with RFC 9000’s privacy-preserving guidelines. Unlike user space tools, By leveraging eBPF, LinkQUIC operates entirely in kernel space without requiring kernel modifications, encryption keys or prior knowledge of specific QUIC deployments. We evaluate LinkQUIC in real-world environments and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying QUIC traffic, including complex migration scenarios, with minimal overhead."

A numerical model of the sandwich structure is developed using the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) multiphase coupling algorithm, which is used to analyze its load-reduction mechanism. The results demonstrate that the layered design of the sandwich structure effectively homogenizes plastic deformation through stress concentration. By sacrificing part of the instantaneous acceleration reduction capacity, it achieves a longer structural response time and more uniform load distribution, thereby improving the overall load reduction performance."

    "abstract": "As 6G scenarios grow in complexity, network operators need an automated and optimized approach to managing Quality-of-Service (QoS) in the radio access network (RAN). Transitioning from resource-focused management to one that considers evolving operator intents is essential. This can be achieved by translating service-level agreement (SLA) intents into operational rules to ensure compliance and save costs. O-RAN introduced the RAN intelligent controller (RIC) and intelligent applications (xApps) to enhance the RAN operation. Furthermore, RAN slicing has been shown as the most promising method to provide O-RAN-based QoS in 6G. However, while existing methods optimize resources allocated per slice, they often overlook SLAs. This leads to suboptimal resource usage and outages when the system fails to meet target key performance indicators (KPIs). This work introduces SLAQ, an xApp designed to translate service operator requirements to optimize spectrum resource sharing. SLAQ monitors key performance metrics (KPMs) and employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to make decisions within the RAN. SLA policies are modeled and integrated into the xApp to optimize resource distribution while preventing SLA conflicts and outages. Our highly-detailed system-level simulations show that SLAQ effectively learns optimal actions, achieving high communication reliability, i.e., close to $99 \\%$ for ultra-reliable low-latency communications."

    "abstract": "Modern manufacturing systems require adaptive computing infrastructures that can respond to highly dynamic workloads and increasingly customized production demands. The compute continuum emerges as a promising solution, enabling flexible deployment of microservices across distributed, heterogeneous domains. However, this paradigm also requires a novel approach to resource allocation and service placement, as traditional centralized solutions struggle to scale effectively, suffer from latency bottlenecks, and introduce single points of failure. In this paper, we present DREAMS, a decentralized framework that optimizes microservice placement decisions collaboratively across different computational domains. At its core, DREAMS introduces agents that operate autonomously within each domain while coordinating globally through a Raft-based consensus algorithm and cost-benefit voting. This decentralized architecture enables responsive, privacy-preserving, and faulttolerant coordination, making it particularly suitable given the growing prevalence of multi-stakeholder scenarios across the compute continuum. In particular, within modern manufacturing environments, DREAMS achieves globally optimized service placements while maintaining high fault tolerance. Our evaluations further demonstrate that key coordination operations, such as Local Domain Manager (LDM) registration and migration voting, scale sub-linearly with the number of domains, confirming the efficiency and scalability of our proposed framework."

As a chemical product, propellant undergoes individual testing during production and deployment to evaluate fundamental performance metrics such as burn rate and pressure exponent. However, obtaining an accurate assessment of the propellant's comprehensive performance remains challenging, thereby limiting effective control over internal ballistic behavior. This study presents a scaled-down engine design methodology, wherein reduced-scale engine tests are conducted to evaluate propellant performance. This approach facilitates the acquisition of comprehensive performance data at a significantly reduced cost, offering an efficient and practical means of assessing propellant characteristics."

In this work, we combine source polarization with several entropy coding techniques to improve the compression efficiency while keeping the additional complexity negligible. In our framework, the standard encoding of polar codes can be treated as a pre-transform on the source data, and only a small proportion of the transformed data needs further compression thanks to the source polarization. We show that our framework is compatible with the mainstream entropy coding schemes such as Huffman coding, arithmetic coding, and asymmetric number system (ANS). To optimize performance, an iterative algorithm is proposed for the set partitioning of the transformed data. Simulation results show that the improved scheme is superior to the original polar source coding."

    "abstract": "Background: Late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS), which occurs 72 hours after birth, remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Traditional diagnostic methods are often delayed or infeasible in such environments. This study investigated statistical and machine learning approaches to enhance the early prediction of LONS and support timely clinical decision-making. Methods: Neonatal data from the first admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within five days of delivery were retrieved from the MIMIC-III database. After preprocessing, a total of 83 variables were retained. Fifteen key features were identified based on their clinical relevance and one-way ANOVA across seven different sepsis criteria frameworks. Machine learning techniques such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and random forest were evaluated with and without applying SMOTE to correct class imbalance. Ensemble classifiers were developed, and their performance was assessed via 10-fold cross-validation and an independent test dataset. Results: Gradient boosting and LightGBM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9269 and 0.9258, respectively, whereas random forest with SMOTE reached an AUROC of 0.9255. The final soft voting classifier, which combines the top three models, demonstrated robust performance, with an AUROC of 0.9271, an accuracy of 0.8521, and an F1 score of 0.7698. Conclusion: A machine learning–based ensemble approach using only 15 features can effectively predict LONS from clinical data within the first 24 hours of NICU admission. This data-driven model offers a scalable, real-time decision-support tool for neonatal care."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence technology advances, the generalization performance of audio deepfake detection systems has improved rapidly and significantly. However, these systems still face substantial challenges when confronted with adversarial attacks. To address this issue, many studies have proposed defense methods against such attacks. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have focused on defenses in the context of audio deepfake detection. With the development of deep learning, deepfake detection methods are increasingly designed and deployed based on deep learning models. As a result, deepfake detection systems can be applied across various fields and are not restricted to specific data types or domains. Such approaches are referred to as ‘domain-independent’ defense methods and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including adversarial training. However, they have limitations, such as requiring significant computing resources or potentially degrading original performance. In this paper, we propose Inference-Time Noise Addition (ITNA), an effective and efficient adversarial attack defense method that minimizes the original performance degradation. ITNA adds Gaussian noise once to the input audio sample during the inference phase. It is highly resource efficient, as it does not require additional training or separate AI components. Furthermore, ITNA minimizes performance degradation as much as possible and provides scalability that can be used with other defense methods. We provide a theoretical explanation of the effectiveness of ITNA and validate it through experimental results. Our experiments were conducted on the ASVspoof2021 DF evaluation (official deepfake audio dataset from the ASVspoof community), In-The-Wild (collected in real environments) and DSD-Corpus datasets (includes various synthesizer samples). And experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of ITNA, reducing the average misclassification rate and the attack success rate of detection systems by 4.48% and 31.90%, respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of ITNA through comparative experiments with alternative noise type and existing noise-based defense method."

    "abstract": "The traditional mathematical models of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM) usually ignore the influences of the eddy current and hysteresis effects due to the fact that there is no appropriate parameter to quantitatively characterize these effects. However, with the increase of operating frequency of the SPMSM and switching frequency of the converter, their influences are becoming increasingly serious and have to be considered. The vector magnetic circuit (VMC) theory contains three basic magnetic circuit parameters, i.e., reluctance, magdutance, and hysteretance, which respectively characterize the magnetization, eddy current effect, and hysteresis effects in the magnetic circuit, and provide a new prospective for motor control to consider the eddy current and hysteresis effects. Therefore, based on the VMC theory, this paper establishes the mathematical model of the SPMSM by proposing a R-L coordinate transformation to consider eddy current and hysteresis effects in the iron core, but keep the d- and q- axis equations decoupled. Consequently, based on the proposed mathematical model, the novel <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i<sub>d</sub></i> = 0 vector control of SPMSM is designed.

    "abstract": "Humans possess seven types of intelligence for learning. However, conventional educational systems mostly rely only on the Linguistic and Mathematical types. This narrow focus leaves other intelligences unrecognized and unutilized in learners’ learning processes. The main challenge lies in holistically addressing diverse intelligence levels in typical educational settings. Prior research isolated dominant intelligence traits for personalization, which lack objectivity and fail to utilize the full spectrum of learning potentials. The goal of this research is to identify and predict underlying learning patterns in university students, enabling addressing all types of intelligence holistically at the group level. To achieve this, a multi-algorithm framework integrating unsupervised and supervised learning is developed to analyze Multiple Intelligences profiles and associated learner parameters from the Learning Meta-Learning dataset. MI profiles capture all seven types of intelligences. K-Means clustering identified three unique and interpretable MI profile patterns, outperforming the Two-Step clustering algorithm. For prediction, CatBoost achieved 92.20% accuracy across seven algorithms, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and HistGradientBoosting. By incorporating Explainable Artificial Intelligence through Shapley Additive Explanations and optimizing features, its accuracy improved to 93.66%. The identified Multiple Intelligences profile patterns offer actionable insights. Beyond the high-level guidelines for personalizing instruction outlined in this paper, they can inform various personalized educational approaches and support further research by providing a structured understanding of learner diversity and a predictive framework."

    "abstract": "As driverless technology advances, an immense amount of data will be generated, shared, and used between vehicles, users, and the cloud. This includes road conditions, GPS data, biometric data, which raises significant privacy concerns. This paper presents a secure authentication protocol and privacy protection framework based on chaotic biological cryptography for data sharing and storage in the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles(IoAV) framework. A biometric key generator is designed using single-modal multi-fingerprint feature-level reconstruction, allowing users to generate personalized private key pools. This protects biometric data in the cloud while ensuring revocability. By incorporating a nonlinear control function into the traditional three-dimensional Rucklidge chaotic system, a 4D-Yoz hyperchaotic system is created, ensuring secure key distribution and adherence to the “one time pad” principle. To verify the effectiveness of the chaos creature password and ensure the security of cloud-stored images, proposes an image encryption-storage algorithm based on the “<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$L_{\\infty } $</tex-math> </inline-formula>” metric and the semi-tensor product of the matrix, introducing the chaotic biological key. Experimental simulations and performance analysis show that this algorithm effectively secures image data in the Internet of Vehicles."

    "abstract": "Content-addressable memories (CAMs) are a class of associative memories known for their capability to perform massively parallel comparisons between an input query pattern and the entire memory content. In the past decade, the increasing demand for high-performance and energy-efficient computing systems has generated significant interest in non-volatile CAMs (NV-CAMs) based on emerging non-volatile memory devices. In this work, we propose a novel non-volatile, precharge-free CAM (NV-PCAM) scheme based on double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (DMTJs). When compared to its counterparts, NV-PCAM presents competitive figures of merit in terms of area, speed, and energy efficiency, while also ensuring low search error rates. We also provide a complete class of voltage-divider-based NV-CAM cells for benchmark comparison. All schemes are designed and laid out using a 65 nm process and evaluated under Monte Carlo and process-voltage-temperature (PVT) simulations. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed NV-PCAM demonstrates up to 81% and 85% lower search energy than NV-NOR and NV-NAND, respectively, as well as a 61% and 16% improvement in terms of search delay with a compact cell area footprint."

By employing the backstepping method, a full-state feedback controller is designed to ensure its convergence to the zero equilibrium in minimum time. The traditional backstepping method leads to infinite control gains when applied to systems with repeated eigenvalue speeds. To overcome this challenge, we first decouple the repeated eigenvalue speed states and then design a simpler target system to eliminate the singularity. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the effectiveness of the results obtained."

    "abstract": "Endothelial reactivity (ER) is a critical marker of vascular health and a predictor of cardiovascular risk. While ultrasound-based diameter measurements during flow-mediated dilation (FMD) remains the clinical standard for assessing ER, its limitations, including rater dependency and measurement variability, necessitate alternative approaches. In this study, we propose a novel sensor-based measurement methodology, that leverages local pulse wave velocity (PWV) at the brachial artery for endothelial reactivity assessment (ERA). Beat-to-beat local brachial PWV was measured using dual piezoelectric transducers (PWVP) through pulse signal processing and foot detection algorithm. The processed signal then underwent time-series analysis during the reactive hyperemia (RH) procedure for ERA. The approach was validated through two studies: (1) a repeatability and measurement validation study (n = 10), comparing baseline PWVP to ultrasound-derived PWV (PWVU), and (2) an intervention study (n = 40) evaluating the correlation between ERA and FMD during reactive hyperemia. PWVP showed strong agreement with PWVU (R² = 0.89, p < 0.0001), and higher intra-rater measurement repeatability (ICC = 0.91 vs. 0.87). Baseline PWVP exhibited a significant negative correlation with arterial diameter (R² = 0.71) and was higher in females (18.37%). ERA measured via PWVP was consistent across sessions (ICC > 0.85) and showed strong correlation with FMD (R² = 0.88). Notably, mean absolute ERA (34.62%) was higher than FMD (8.64%). These results demonstrate that local PWVP offers a robust and non-invasive approach to assess ER, serving as a practical alternative to ultrasound-based methods, with improved repeatability and strong physiological relevance. This methodology holds promise for scalable vascular health monitoring in clinical and research settings."

    "abstract": "Though powerful tools for analysis and communication, interactive visualizations often fail to support real-time interaction with large datasets with millions or more records. To highlight and filter data, users indicate values or intervals of interest. Such selections may span multiple components, combine in complex ways, and require optimizations to ensure low-latency updates. We describe Mosaic Selections, a model for representing, managing, and optimizing user selections, in which one or more filter predicates are added to queries that request data for visualizations and input widgets. By analyzing both queries and selection predicates, Mosaic Selections enable automatic optimizations, including pre-aggregating data to rapidly compute selection updates. We contribute a formal description of our selection model and optimization methods, and their implementation in the open-source Mosaic architecture. Benchmark results demonstrate orders-of-magnitude latency improvements for selection-based optimizations over unoptimized queries and existing optimizers for the Vega language. The Mosaic Selection model provides infrastructure for flexible, interoperable filtering across multiple visualizations, alongside automatic optimizations to scale to millions and even billions of records"

    "abstract": "The 5G Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA) protocol is a 5G standard proposed by 3GPP in order to standardize the authentication procedure of mobile users towards applications based on the authentication of the user to the mobile network. As pointed out by several authors, the 5G-AKMA protocol inherently poses severe security issues, including privacy, unlinkability, ephemeral secret leakage and stolen device attacks. Also, the protocol does not offer perfect forward secrecy. In addition, the network operator is able to record all applications to which the user is subscribed and any outsider eavesdropping the communication channel is able to link requests to different applications coming from the same user. While the state of the shows that various protocols are proposed to solve the 5G-AKMA security issues, they are either vulnerable to severe attacks or are computationally extensive. In this paper, we provide a new version of the protocol able to solve these privacy issues in an effective manner. In addition, we also extend the protocol such that it can be used for communications in multiaccess edge computing (MEC) applications, taking into account handover procedures from one MEC server to another. The proposed protocol has been thoroughly compared to existing ones, revealing its efficiency in terms of communication, computation storage, and energy costs. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed 5G-AKMA reduces computational cost by 92%, communication cost by 74%, storage cost by 38%, and energy consumption cost by 58%. The security verification has been conducted using informal and formal methods (Real-Or-Random (ROR) and Scyther Validation tools) to ensure the protocol’s security. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis under an unknown attack scenario. Furthermore, the simulation is carried out using NS3."

    "abstract": "Panchromatic image enhancement aims to overcome the resolution limitations of satellite sensors by fusing multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) data. However, existing methods often overemphasize certain information, leading to distortion of local details or loss of global structure. To effectively integrate both global and local structural features while preserving the richness of spectral information, this paper proposes a self-supervised panchromatic sharpening network based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model, named DC-Diff. The network introduces a cross-domain feature learning module that jointly learns spectral and spatial representations, serving as conditional guidance for the denoising prediction network. Additionally, a novel frequency-weighted adjustment module is proposed, which incorporates diffusion timestep factors to selectively process information from different frequency components. Experiments conducted on the GF-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in spatial detail recovery, spectral fidelity, and fusion quality, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness across both reduced-resolution and full-resolution test sets. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules, highlighting the method's potential in remote sensing image fusion."

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on quantum mechanics to enable secure communication, with the reconciliation phase playing an essential role in correcting discrepancies in shared keys caused by noise. Conventional Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, while robust against random errors, often struggle with burst errors arising from localized noise sources in practical QKD implementations. To address this challenge, we introduce specialized uniform LDPC codes over Galois fields explicitly designed to correct burst errors effectively. We further present a highly efficient parallel decoder for these LDPC codes, operating within the complexity class NC (Nick’s Class), making it particularly suitable for GPU-based implementation. Our decoder provides guaranteed high-performance reconciliation as long as the number of burst errors remains below a designated threshold. Additionally, we discuss an extension to our decoding approach: when configured to handle higher error rates, the algorithm becomes a Las Vegas algorithm, introducing a small but controlled probability of failure. Finally, we propose a basic algorithm for generating these specialized LDPC codes and highlight prospective optimizations required for constructing larger matrices."

THOR is compared with OSPF using the ns-3 simulator for the case of minimum-hop routing, and the simulation results show that the approach used in THOR leads to faster convergence and less signalling overhead."

    "abstract": "To enhance the system-level simulation capability for the thermodynamic properties of cryogenic liquid rocket engines with high efficiency and precision, a thermodynamic properties library for common cryogenic propellants, including hydrogen, methane, and oxygen, was developed using the Modelica language based on the Helmholtz energy equation of state (EOS). The performance of three iterative methods-Broyden method with superlinear convergence, Newton method with quadratic convergence, and the modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method with cubic convergence-was systematically evaluated in terms of solution time and number of iterations. To verify the adaptability of the developed thermodynamic properties library, steady-state heat transfer simulation program for hydrogen and transient heat transfer simulation program for methane cooling channels were established for cryogenic liquid rocket engine applications. The results indicate that the developed thermodynamic properties library exhibits high accuracy, with a maximum average relative error of no more than 0.89% compared to the NIST standard data. In engineering applications, the average relative error for hydrogen steady-state heat transfer simulations remained below 5.81%, while the average relative error for methane transient heat transfer simulation was controlled within 1.14%. Additionally, it was found that converges more easily in the two-phase and gas regions compared to the liquid and supercritical regions. The three iterative methods used in this study significantly reduced solution time compared to calling NIST data. Although Newton method had slightly more iterations than the cubic-convergence modified LM method, its simpler computational process in each iteration resulted in the shortest solution time, saving 49.2% of the time cost compared to calling NIST data."

    "abstract": "During the water-exit process of an underwater-launched vehicle traversing the free surface, the collapse of cavitation envelopes adhering to the vehicle's shoulder generates significant unsteady hydrodynamic loads. This phenomenon is markedly intensified in a wave environment, where dynamic free-surface deformations and multiscale interactions within the cavitating flow field amplify flow complexity. This study employs the fifth-order Stokes wave model, integrated with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase flow framework and the Schnerr-Sauer cavitation model, to investigate the cavitation evolution characteristics and kinematic response of the vehicle during water exit under varying launch velocities and wave phase conditions. The findings reveal that a reduced cavitation number promotes the development of more pronounced cavitation bubble morphologies at the vehicle's shoulder. In a wave environment, the influence of wave phase on cavitation dynamics during water exit is accentuated, exacerbating the asymmetry of cavitation bubbles between the windward and leeward sides and altering the loci of bubble collapse and detachment. As launch velocity increases, the perturbative effects of the wave environment progressively diminish, leading to a consistent reduction in the vehicle's trajectory deviation and yaw angle. Notably, the mitigation of the yaw angle is more pronounced for vehicles exiting at the wave trough phase with increasing launch velocity."

    "abstract": "Cross-chain bridges, while critical for interoperability in the Web3 ecosystem, have become a primary target for exploits, accounting for over $4.3 billion in losses—nearly 40% of all value stolen in recent years. Existing security paradigms fail to address this threat adequately due to a fundamental trade-off between pre-deployment static analysis and real-time dynamic monitoring. Current security paradigms are trapped in a critical trade-off: pre-deployment static analysis lacks runtime context and suffers from high false-positives, while real-time dynamic monitoring is blind to the underlying source-code vulnerabilities that enable sophisticated attacks. This paper introduces VeriBridge, a novel framework that breaks this impasse. VeriBridge pioneers a synergistic fusion of static intelligence and dynamic graph learning. It enriches real-time transaction graphs with fine-grained vulnerability data extracted from static analysis, providing crucial security context to an unsupervised Graph Autoencoder. By learning a high-fidelity model of normal behavior, VeriBridge detects malicious transactions, including zero-day exploits, as significant deviations from this learned norm, identified by high reconstruction error. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of real-world attacks, including the Poly Network and THORchain exploits, VeriBridge achieves a 96% F1-score, demonstrating a new frontier in robust, real-time security for critical blockchain infrastructure."

This study proposes an Adaptive Mutation-based Differential Evolution-enhanced Double-Layer Deep Reinforcement Learning (AMSDE-DL-DRL) framework to address collaborative task scheduling for multiple UAVs in fire emergency scenarios. The framework employs a hierarchical architecture that decouples task allocation and path planning: an upper-layer encoder-decoder policy network handles multi-UAV task allocation, while a differential evolution-optimized attention network in the lower layer conducts single-UAV path planning under maximum flight distance constraints to maximize executed tasks. An Interactive Training Strategy (ITS) integrating pretraining, reinforcement training, and alternating phases optimizes training efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that AMSDE-DL-DRL significantly outperforms OR-Tools in task completion rate and maintains robust generalization at hundred-task scales, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness in balancing performance and training efficiency. This approach provides a novel solution for large-scale dynamic multi-agent collaboration challenges."
