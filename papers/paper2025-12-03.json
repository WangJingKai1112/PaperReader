    "abstract": "Reasoning models leveraging long chains of thought employ various cognitive skills, such as verification of their answers, backtracking, retrying by an alternate method, and more. Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly learn these skills during a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Our approach does not rely on distillation from a stronger model, but instead uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data in the format of those skills. These \"silver\" SFT traces may be imperfect, but are nevertheless effective for priming a model to acquire skills during RL. Our evaluation shows that (1) starting from SkillFactory SFT initialization helps a model to generalize to harder variants of a task post-RL, despite lower performance pre-RL; (2) cognitive skills are indeed used by the model; (3) RLed SkillFactory models are more robust to regression on out-of-domain tasks than RLed base models. Our work suggests that inductive biases learned prior to RL help models learn robust cognitive skill use."

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong qualitative visual understanding, but struggle with metrically precise spatial reasoning required for embodied applications. The agentic paradigm promises that VLMs can use a wide variety of tools that could augment these capabilities, such as depth estimators, segmentation models, and pose estimators. Yet it remains an open challenge how to realize this vision without solely relying on handcrafted prompting strategies or enforcing fixed, predefined tool pipelines that limit VLMs' ability to discover optimal tool-use patterns. Reinforcement Learning could overcome this gap, but has so far been limited to reasoning with a single visual tool due to the large search space in multi-tool reasoning. We introduce Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL), a two-phase training framework where VLMs learn to coordinate multiple tools through interactive exploration and feedback. In the teaching phase, we combine demonstrations from a single tool specialist trained via interactive RL with traces from a frontier model using all tools. In the exploration phase, the model further refines multi-tool coordination through continued RL. Our model, SpaceTools, with tool-augmented spatial reasoning ability, achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial understanding benchmarks (RoboSpatial-Home, BLINK, BOP-ASK) and demonstrates reliable real-world manipulation using a 7-DOF robot as a tool. DIRL provides substantial improvements over the vanilla SFT (+12% on RoboSpatial) and RL (+16% on RoboSpatial) baselines. Project page: https://spacetools.github.io/."

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures."

In addition to the superhump modulation, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found. Aims. Our aim is to determine the occurrence, strength, and variability of QPOs in TT Ari based on more complete data than in previous works. Methods. The data were obtained during the high state of TT Ari in October 2012 by the MOST space telescope, covering a total of 361.2 hours of continuous observation. We searched for frequencies over subsets of time using a Fourier-like power spectrum and then added the frequencies together, forming groups. Results. Our method has revealed QPOs that occur in \"frequency groups\", which are events with a continuous oscillation of similar, constant or slowly variable frequency. We report a total of 160 frequency groups in the period range between 14 and 53 minutes (27 and 98 days-1), with two peaks in the power spectrum at 18.5 and 33.8 minutes (42.5 and 77.5 days-1). The duration of these frequency groups varies between 0.72 and 7.5 hours (average 2.8 hours) revealing between 3 and 18 complete cycles in the light curve. Most of them show significant frequency variations over the course of their duration. Sometimes two frequency groups occur simultaneously. An analysis with randomised data confirms that stochastic processes can only explain a fraction of the QPOs found. The occurrence of QPOs appears not to be related to the superhump phase."

    "abstract": "Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of high-redshift galaxies ($z\\gtrsim5$) exhibiting unexpectedly bright ultraviolet (UV) nitrogen emission lines. The strong N III] and N IV] features imply nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) as high as $-0.8 \\lesssim \\log(\\mathrm{N/O}) \\lesssim 0.4$ in these low-metallicity galaxies ($12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H}) \\lesssim 8.2$), compared to the local value of $\\log(\\mathrm{N/O})\\approx-1.5$. If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H II region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure, simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H II model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact ($\\lesssim0.1\\,$dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width (EW)-based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance is varying. All nitrogen-enhanced galaxies have moderate to high gas pressure ($7.0\\leq\\log (P/k)\\leq9.8$) and high ionization parameter ($\\log(U)\\gtrsim-2.0$), indicating a dense and compact environment. We suggest that super star clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars and massive stars are the most likely contributors to the elevated nitrogen abundance in these galaxies."

    "abstract": "Evolved late-type stars are frequently identified as photometric and spectroscopic variables, such as Mira-type or semi-regular variable objects. These stars can also be polarimetrically variable, an indicator of non-spherical geometry for spatially unresolved sources. Departures from symmetry can arise in a number of ways, such as the presence of a binary companion (e.g., multiple illumination sources for scattered light), brightness variations in the stellar atmosphere (e.g., large convective cells), or aspherical circumstellar envelopes (e.g., disks or aspherical stellar winds). Common polarigenic opacities for cool stars include Rayleigh scattering and dust scattering. The classic wavelength dependence of lambda^-4 for Rayleigh single scattering is generally straightforward; however, that signature can be confounded by interstellar polarization (ISP). We explore strategies for interpreting polarimetric observations when the interstellar polarization (ISP) cannot be removed. We introduce a \"hybrid\" spectrum that includes both Rayleigh polarization for a stellar contribution and the Serkowski Law for an interstellar contribution. We find the polarization spectral slope can be more shallow than expected from Rayleigh scattering alone. For stellar variability, shorter wavelengths give higher amplitude changes when Rayleigh scattering dominates the interstellar signal. Quite anomalous slopes can occur over limited wavelength intervals if the stellar and interstellar position angles differ by 90 deg. Results of the models are discussed in the context of photopolarimetry methods, and an application is considered in terms of variable polarization from the carbon star, R Scl."

In this work, we study the powder XRD-to-structure mapping using gradient descent optimization, with the goal of recovering the correct structure from moderately distorted initial states based solely on XRD similarity. We show that commonly used XRD similarity metrics result in a highly non-convex landscape, complicating direct optimization. Constraining the optimization to the ground-truth crystal family significantly improves recovery, yielding higher match rates and increased mutual information and correlation scores between structural similarity and XRD similarity. Nevertheless, the landscape may remain non-convex along certain symmetry axes. These findings suggest that symmetry-aware inductive biases could play a meaningful role in helping learning models navigate the inverse mapping from diffraction to structure."

This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics."

Despite the prevalence of this behavior, a significant disconnect persists between mainstream e-commerce search engines and users' comparison needs. Traditional ranking models often evaluate items in isolation, disregarding the context in which users compare multiple items on a search results page. While recent advances in deep learning have sought to improve ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness by encoding listwise context, the challenge of aligning search rankings with user comparison shopping behavior remains inadequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking architecture - Learning-to-Comparison-Shop (LTCS) System - that explicitly models and learns users' comparison shopping behaviors. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant gains in key business metrics - improving NDCG by 1.7% and boosting booking conversion rate by 0.6% in A/B testing - while also enhancing user experience. We also compare our model against state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate that LTCS significantly outperforms them."

To address this, we propose a mixed-type continuous finite element discretization in the physical domain, combined with a collocation discretization in the stochastic domain. For the mixed formulation, we first introduce a stochastic cost functional at the continuous level. This formulation is then enhanced to incorporate the vanishing tangential trace constraint directly into a mesh-dependent cost functional, rather than enforcing it in the solution's function space. In this context, we define a mesh-dependent norm and provide an error analysis based on this norm. We employ the collocation method by collocating the stochastic equation at the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials. This approach leads to a system of uncoupled deterministic problems, simplifying computation. Furthermore, we establish an a poriori error bound for the fully discrete approximation, detailing the convergence rates with respect to the discretization parameters. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm and validate the theoretical findings."

Existing RR monitors often suffer from baseline drift over time, breaths can be occluded by limb or body movements, and many systems struggle to resolve shallow or extreme thoracic motion. Here, we propose a novel RR-monitoring sensor based on fiber-cavity attenuated phase-shift spectroscopy~(CAPS). The sensor comprises a fiber cavity whose portion is embedded into a flexible chest binder in a sinusoidal-like pattern, which the patient wears. Thoracic expansion and contraction during breathing modulate the cavity, and RR is extracted through CAPS measurements. Our sensor exhibits high reproducibility, strong sensitivity to strain and pressure induced by chest movements, inherent resistance to baseline drift, and the ability to detect body movements. The system achieves a root-mean-square error of 0.91 breaths per minute relative to the ground truth, across RR values ranging from 8 to 44 breaths per minute, when tested on multiple subjects in various postures, including sitting, supine, prone, and lateral positions. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of comprehensive optical fiber-based sleep monitoring systems."

Hence, it is vital to control Vortex-Induced Vibrations of cylindrical structures. For this purpose, in this study a novel approach is introduced to VIV control, based on a model-based active control strategy integrated with a Neural Network (NN) in the presence of uncertainty modeling. The proposed method utilizes a closed-loop control system, where feedback from the system's dynamic state is used to generate adaptive control commands, enabling the system to respond to changing flow conditions and nonlinearities. Then, the controllability analysis is conducted to assess the efficiency of the control strategy in mitigating VIV. Two control approaches are implemented: simple learning and composite learning. Both strategies significantly enhance vibration suppression, achieving up to 99% reduction in vibrations despite uncertainties in the system. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency, stability, and lifespan of structures subject to VIV."

Several milestones mark the development of this area, such as the introduction of methods that use transformer models, the generation of discrete synthetic text, and the scaling to decoder-only models with over 1B parameters. Despite major advances in modern approaches, the field remains in a maturing phase, with room for improvement on benchmarking standardization, approaches to overcome the discrete nature of text, handling complex tasks, and providing explicit examples of real-world applications.

This study examines the automatic classification of user satisfaction through analysis of social signals, aiming to enhance both manual and autonomous evaluation methods for SIAs. During a field trial at the Deutsches Museum Bonn, a Furhat Robotics head was employed as a service and information hub, collecting an \"in-the-wild\" dataset. This dataset comprises 46 single-user interactions, including questionnaire responses and video data. Our method focuses on automatically classifying user satisfaction based on time series classification. We use time series of social signal metrics derived from the body pose, time series of facial expressions, and physical distance. This study compares three feature engineering approaches on different machine learning models. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in reliably identifying interactions with low user satisfaction without the need for manually annotated datasets.

Existing measures often conflate genuine structural division with random topological features, yielding misleadingly high polarization scores on random networks, and failing to distinguish real-world networks from randomized null models. We introduce DSP, a Diffusion-based Structural Polarization measure designed from first principles to correct for such biases. DSP removes the arbitrary concept of 'influencers' used by the popular Random Walk Controversy (RWC) score, instead treating every node as a potential origin for a random walk. To validate our approach, we introduce a set of desirable properties for polarization measures, expressed through reference topologies with known structural properties. We show that DSP satisfies these desiderata, being near-zero for non-polarized structures such as cliques and random networks, while correctly capturing the expected polarization of reference topologies such as monochromatic-splittable networks. Our method applied to U.S. Congress datasets uncovers trends of increasing polarization in recent years. By integrating a null model into its core definition, DSP provides a reliable and interpretable diagnostic tool, highlighting the necessity of statistically-grounded metrics to analyze societal fragmentation."

The chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) captures this uncertainty but rapidly becomes computationally challenging as the number of scenarios grows. Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential route to overcome such scaling barriers. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of quantum annealing platforms to the chance constrained UCP. Focusing on a scenario approximation, we reformulated the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved it using DWave hybrid quantum classical solver alongside Gurobi. The hybrid solver proved competitive under strict runtime limits for large scenario sets (15,000 in our experiments), while Gurobi remained superior on smaller cases. QUBO reformulations were also tested, but current annealers cannot accommodate stochastic UCPs due to hardware limits, and deterministic cases suffered from embedding overhead. Our study delineates where chance constrained UCPs can already be addressed with hybrid quantum classical methods, and where current quantum annealers remain fundamentally limited."

Experimentally, we realized the first velocity-selective Raman transition in collinear laser spectroscopy. Using a $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion beam, we demonstrate a reduction in the energy width to less than $200\\,$meV, which is about an order of magnitude reduction compared to the usage of an optical dipole transition as in previous works. We also investigate two-photon Rabi oscillations and show that their observed collapse is consistent with the simulations."

    "abstract": "Prior Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically trained on teleoperated successful demonstrations, while discarding numerous failed attempts that occur naturally during data collection. However, these failures encode where and how policies can be fragile, information that can be exploited to improve robustness. We address this problem by leveraging mixed-quality datasets to learn failure-aware reasoning at planning time. We introduce VINE, a hierarchical vision-language-action model that separates high-level reasoning (System 2) from low-level control (System 1) under a hierarchical reinforcement learning formalism, making failures usable as a structured learning signal rather than noisy supervision. System 2 performs feasibility-guided tree search over a 2D scene-graph abstraction: it proposes subgoal transitions, predicts success probabilities from both successes and failures, and prunes brittle branches before execution, effectively casting plan evaluation as feasibility scoring. The selected subgoal sequence is then passed to System 1, which executes low-level actions without modifying the agent's core skills. Trained entirely from offline teleoperation data, VINE integrates negative experience directly into the decision loop. Across challenging manipulation tasks, this approach consistently improves success rates and robustness, demonstrating that failure data is an essential resource for converting the broad competence of VLAs into robust execution."

    "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data offers vital insights for understanding brain function and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Unsupervised clustering methods are desired to group individuals based on shared features, facilitating clinical diagnosis. In this study, a parsimonious clustering model is proposed, which integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and covariance regression framework, to cluster individuals based on FC captured by data covariance matrices in resting-state fMRI studies. The model assumes common linear projections across covariance matrices and a generalized linear model with covariates, allowing for flexible yet interpretable projection-specific clustering solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, extensive simulation studies are conducted to assess clustering accuracy and robustness. The approach is applied to resting-state fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Subgroups are identified based on brain coherence and simultaneously uncover the association with demographic factors and cognitive functions."

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports watch-and-wait (WW) surveillance for patients with rectal cancer who show clinical complete response (cCR) at restaging following total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT). However, objectively accurate methods to early detect local regrowth (LR) from follow-up endoscopy images during WW are essential to manage care and prevent distant metastases. Hence, we developed a Siamese Swin Transformer with Dual Cross-Attention (SSDCA) to combine longitudinal endoscopic images at restaging and follow-up and distinguish cCR from LR. SSDCA leverages pretrained Swin transformers to extract domain agnostic features and enhance robustness to imaging variations. Dual cross attention is implemented to emphasize features from the two scans without requiring any spatial alignment of images to predict response. SSDCA as well as Swin-based baselines were trained using image pairs from 135 patients and evaluated on a held-out set of image pairs from 62 patients. SSDCA produced the best balanced accuracy (81.76\\% $\\pm$ 0.04), sensitivity (90.07\\% $\\pm$ 0.08), and specificity (72.86\\% $\\pm$ 0.05). Robustness analysis showed stable performance irrespective of artifacts including blood, stool, telangiectasia, and poor image quality. UMAP clustering of extracted features showed maximal inter-cluster separation (1.45 $\\pm$ 0.18) and minimal intra-cluster dispersion (1.07 $\\pm$ 0.19) with SSDCA, confirming discriminative representation learning."

    "abstract": "At large scales, the Reynolds stress tensor exhibits notable anisotropy, a key feature of all wall-bounded turbulent flows. Yet, how the drivers of this anisotropy evolve with shearing and thermal stratification in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL) remains a daunting challenge for theory and models alike. Here, the velocity variance budgets are used to explore the evolution of anisotropy in the daytime ASL close to the surface, region known to be problematic for large eddy simulations. A special focus is placed on the importance of slow and rapid pressure-strain correlations and the role of transport on partitioning the turbulent kinetic energy among the velocity components. Results obtained from near-surface observations of four datasets over flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain show persistent anisotropy over a wide range of flux Richardson numbers $R_{if}$ and wall-normal distances, and highlight the importance of different processes in three distinct flow regimes, roughly related to dynamic ($|R_{if}|\\ll1$), dynamic-convective ($|R_{if}|\\sim1$) and convective ($|R_{if}|\\gg1$) regimes of the ASL. In particular, close to the surface in the dynamic-convective regime, a drop in wall-normal velocity variance and a substantial increase of spanwise velocity variance are shown to result from the increasing role of pressure transport and rapid distortion, related to turbulence organization. This behaviour is not captured by the classic Rotta closure but requires the inclusion of both rapid pressure-strain and transport terms. In all regimes wall blocking is found to influence turbulence close to the surface, thus requiring the adoption of an anisotropic Rotta model to accommodate its effects."

    "abstract": "Transformer decoders have achieved strong results across tasks, but the memory required for the KV cache becomes prohibitive at long sequence lengths. Although Cross-layer KV Cache sharing (e.g., YOCO, CLA) offers a path to mitigate KV Cache bottleneck, it typically underperforms within-layer methods like GQA. To understand the root cause, we investigate the information flow of keys and values of the top-layers. Our preliminary reveals a clear distribution: values are predominantly derived from the bottom layer, while keys draw more information from both bottom and middle layers. Building upon this, we propose FusedKV, whose top-layer KV caches are a learnable fusion of the most informative ones from the bottom and middle layers. This fusion operates directly on post-RoPE keys, preserving relative positional information without the computational cost of re-applying rotary embeddings. To further improve efficiency, we propose FusedKV-Lite, an cross-layer sharing approach, where top-layer KV caches are directly derived from the bottom-layer values and the middle-layer keys. Compared to FusedKV, FusedKV-Lite reduces I/O overhead at the cost of a slight increase in perplexity. In experiments on LLMs ranging from 332M to 4B parameters, our proposed method reduce 50\\% cache memory while achieving lower validation perplexity than the standard Transformer decoder, establishing it as a memory-efficient, high-performance architectural alternative."

Recent studies have shown how using traditionally trained estimators for this task can lead to suboptimal solutions. Using the actual decision cost as a loss function (called Decision Focused Learning) can address this issue, but with a severe loss of scalability at training time. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration method based on replacing costly loss function evaluations with an efficient surrogate. Unlike previously defined surrogates, our approach relies on unbiased estimators reducing the risk of spurious local optima and can provide information on its local confidence allowing one to switch to a fallback method when needed. Furthermore, the surrogate is designed for a black-box setting, which enables compensating for simplifications in the optimization model and account- ing for recourse actions during cost computation. In our results, the method reduces costly inner solver calls, with a solution quality comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong performance in LLM post-training, but real-world deployment often involves noisy or incomplete supervision. In such settings, complex and unreliable supervision signals can destabilize training and harm generalization. While existing approaches such as worst-case optimization (e.g., RFQI, CQL) and mean-based methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO) can improve stability, they often overlook generalization and may produce overly conservative policies, leading to uneven performance across diverse real scenarios. To this end, we introduce DVPO (Distributional Value Modeling with Risk-aware Policy Optimization), a new RL framework that combines conditional risk theory with distributional value modeling to better balance robustness and generalization. DVPO learns token-level value distributions to provide fine-grained supervision, and applies an asymmetric risk regularization to shape the distribution tails: it contracts the lower tail to dampen noisy negative deviations, while expanding the upper tail to preserve exploratory diversity. Across extensive experiments and analysis in multi-turn dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific QA, DVPO consistently outperforms PPO, GRPO, and robust Bellman-based PPO under noisy supervision, showing its potential for LLM post-training in the real-world."

    "abstract": "We study the design of robust subexponential algorithms for classical connectivity problems on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. In this setting, each vertex corresponds to a geometric object, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their objects intersect. We introduce a new tool for designing such algorithms, which we call a $λ$-linked partition. This is a partition of the vertex set into groups of highly connected vertices. Crucially, such a partition can be computed in polynomial time and does not require access to the geometric representation of the graph. We apply this framework to problems related to paths and cycles in graphs. First, we obtain the first robust ETH-tight algorithms for Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle, running in time $2^{O(n^{1-1/d})}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This resolves an open problem of de Berg et al. [STOC 2018] and completes the study of these problems on geometric intersection graphs from the viewpoint of ETH-tight exact algorithms. We further extend our approach to the parameterized setting and design the first robust subexponential parameterized algorithm for Long Path in any fixed dimension $d$. More precisely, we obtain a randomized robust algorithm running in time $2^{O(k^{1-1/d}\\log^2 k)}\\, n^{O(1)}$ on intersection graphs of similarly sized fat objects in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $k$ is the natural parameter. Besides $λ$-linked partitions, our algorithm also relies on a low-treewidth pattern covering theorem that we establish for geometric intersection graphs, which may be viewed as a refinement of a result of Marx-Pilipczuk [ESA 2017]. This structural result may be of independent interest."

However, existing studies have overemphasized specialized numerical modelling, making the professional output challenging to understand and use by non-research stakeholders. In this context, this article proposes a 3D virtual geographic environment for flood representation towards risk communication, which integrates flood modelling, parallel computation, and 3D representation in a pipeline. Finally, a section of the Rhine River in Bonn, Germany, is selected for experiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of flood modelling and 3D representation within a few hours, the parallel speedup ratio reached 6.45. The intuitive flood scene with 3D city models is beneficial for promoting flood risk communication and is particularly helpful for participants without direct experience of floods to understand its spatiotemporal process. It also can be embedded in the Geospatial Infrastructure Management Ecosystem (GeoIME) cloud application for intelligent flood systems."

This paper presents a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), and Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks (MADQN) to jointly optimize UAV positioning, resource allocation, Quality of Service (QoS), and energy efficiency through 5G network slicing. The framework adopts Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE), enabling autonomous real-time decision-making while preserving global coordination. Users are prioritized into Premium (A), Silver (B), and Bronze (C) slices with distinct QoS requirements. Experiments in realistic urban and rural scenarios show that MAPPO achieves the best overall QoS-energy tradeoff, especially in interference-rich environments; MADDPG offers more precise continuous control and can attain slightly higher SINR in open rural settings at the cost of increased energy usage; and MADQN provides a computationally efficient baseline for discretized action spaces. These findings demonstrate that no single MARL algorithm is universally dominant; instead, algorithm suitability depends on environmental topology, user density, and service requirements. The proposed framework highlights the potential of MARL-driven UAV systems to enhance scalability, reliability, and differentiated QoS delivery in next-generation wireless networks."

We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $β$, $α$, and the massive parameters ($η_{1}$ and $η_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($α$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($η_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak."

These maps are affected by relativistic redshift-space distortions (RSDs), which become increasingly relevant on ultra-large scales. Accurate modelling of these relativistic RSDs is essential to avoid systematic biases in key cosmological measurements, such as primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). To address this, we introduce an updated implementation of the LIGER method, LIGER4GAL, which incorporates all linear-order relativistic RSDs directly at the tracer level of high-resolution N-body simulations. We demonstrate that LIGER4GAL improves upon previous iterations of the LIGER method by reproducing the expected non-linear clustering while maintaining accuracy for relativistic RSDs on large scales. We use the updated code to generate a DESI-like sample of luminous red galaxies from the Huge MultiDark Planck simulation. By measuring the power spectrum multipoles of this sample with and without the imprint of relativistic RSDs, we assess the impact of relativistic effects on measurements of the local PNG signal ($f_\\mathrm{nl}$). We find that the omission of the''finger-of-the-observer'' (sourced by the peculiar velocity of the observer) effect in the power spectrum modelling can bias measurements of $f_{\\rm nl}$ by more than $1$ ($0.25$) $ σ_{f_{\\rm nl}}$ in 40% (80%) of the possible realizations of the universe if scales down to $k_\\mathrm{min} = 0.0015\\,h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$ are included."

This paper proposes an Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) MIMO framework that uses Reconfigurable Pixel Antenna (RPixA), which introduces additional EM-domain DoF that are electronically controlled through binary antenna coder switch networks. We introduce a beamforming architecture combining this EM and digital precoding to jointly optimize Sensing and Communication. Based on full-wave simulation of pixel antenna, we formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem to maximize sensing rate under user-specific constraints on communication rate. We utilize an Alternating Optimization framework incorporating genetic algorithm for port states of Pixel antennas, and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed EM-aware design achieves considerably higher sensing rate compared to conventional arrays and enables considerable antenna reduction for equivalent ISAC performance. These findings highlight the potential of reconfigurable pixel antennas to realize efficient and scalable EM-aware ISAC systems for future 6G networks."

The approximations are with ``particle-mesh'' (PM) substitutions of the attractions from objects far away, or one modify the Newtonian accelerations (MOND) or the gravities (MOGA). The PM approximation and MOND modification of classical dynamics break the invariances of classical dynamics. The simple three-body system (TBS) is the simplest system to test the approximations and modifications of celestial dynamics, and it is easy to implement on a computer. Simulations of the TBS show that the PM approximation and MOND destabilize TBS. In contrast, the MOGA modification of gravity by replacing Newton's inverse square attraction with an inverse attraction for far-away interactions stabilizes the system. The PM approximation and the MOND modification of classical dynamics do not preserve the momentum and angular momentum of a conservative system exactly, and PM does not obey Newton's third law. Although the errors and shortcomings of these PM approximations and MOND modifications are small, they cause the instability of the regular dynamics."

With the integration of a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer that acts as an electrical mask on alternate active areas, we present a simple approach to fabricate a large-area i-PCA.

A folding-based decoder deforms a 2D grid into 3D, enforcing manifold continuity while preserving geometric fidelity. Trained with Chamfer Distance (CD) and an orthogonality regularizer, the system is evaluated on ModelNet40 across varying Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and bandwidths. Results show performance on par with SEmantic Point cloud Transmission (SEPT) at high bandwidth and clear gains in bandwidth-constrained regimes, with consistent improvements in both Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and CD.

Existing audit methods are too costly to apply at regular time intervals to the wide range of available LLM APIs. This means that model updates are left largely unmonitored in practice. In this work, we show that while LLM log probabilities (logprobs) are usually non-deterministic, they can still be used as the basis for cost-effective continuous monitoring of LLM APIs. We apply a simple statistical test based on the average value of each token logprob, requesting only a single token of output. This is enough to detect changes as small as one step of fine-tuning, making this approach more sensitive than existing methods while being 1,000x cheaper. We introduce the TinyChange benchmark as a way to measure the sensitivity of audit methods in the context of small, realistic model changes."

We show that we can significantly enhance memory of previous tasks by introducing a hard threshold in the learning rule, allowing only edges with sufficiently large training signals to be altered. Thresholding confines tuning to the spatial vicinity of inputs and outputs for each task, effectively partitioning the network into weakly overlapping functional regions. Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost. Our results hint at constrained training as a simple, local, and scalable mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in tunable matter."

The key science topics for the next decades require both approaches and both are developing rapidly towards major performance advances and full sky coverage.

Beyond these projects are several developments which might boost performance at both ends of the ground-based gamma-ray energy range, including the plenoscope approach at low energies and diverse approaches to ultra-high-energy gamma-ray astronomy; from lake-based instruments to arrays of very small Cherenkov telescopes.

    "abstract": "Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach for image generation proposes autoregressive processing across hierarchical scales, decoding multiple tokens per scale in parallel. This method achieves high-quality generation while accelerating synthesis. However, parallel token sampling within a scale may lead to structural errors, resulting in suboptimal generated images. To mitigate this, we propose Latent Scale Rejection Sampling (LSRS), a method that progressively refines token maps in the latent scale during inference to enhance VAR models. Our method uses a lightweight scoring model to evaluate multiple candidate token maps sampled at each scale, selecting the high-quality map to guide subsequent scale generation. By prioritizing early scales critical for structural coherence, LSRS effectively mitigates autoregressive error accumulation while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that LSRS significantly improves VAR's generation quality with minimal additional computational overhead. For the VAR-d30 model, LSRS increases the inference time by merely 1% while reducing its FID score from 1.95 to 1.78. When the inference time is increased by 15%, the FID score can be further reduced to 1.66. LSRS offers an efficient test-time scaling solution for enhancing VAR-based generation."

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles still struggle to exhibit human-like behavior in highly dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios. The key challenge lies in AD's limited ability to interact with surrounding vehicles, largely due to a lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms of social interaction. To address this issue, we introduce MPCFormer, an explainable socially-aware autonomous driving approach with physics-informed and data-driven coupled social interaction dynamics. In this model, the dynamics are formulated into a discrete space-state representation, which embeds physics priors to enhance modeling explainability. The dynamics coefficients are learned from naturalistic driving data via a Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture. To the best of our knowledge, MPCFormer is the first approach to explicitly model the dynamics of multi-vehicle social interactions. The learned social interaction dynamics enable the planner to generate manifold, human-like behaviors when interacting with surrounding traffic. By leveraging the MPC framework, the approach mitigates the potential safety risks typically associated with purely learning-based methods. Open-looped evaluation on NGSIM dataset demonstrates that MPCFormer achieves superior social interaction awareness, yielding the lowest trajectory prediction errors compared with other state-of-the-art approach. The prediction achieves an ADE as low as 0.86 m over a long prediction horizon of 5 seconds. Close-looped experiments in highly intense interaction scenarios, where consecutive lane changes are required to exit an off-ramp, further validate the effectiveness of MPCFormer. Results show that MPCFormer achieves the highest planning success rate of 94.67%, improves driving efficiency by 15.75%, and reduces the collision rate from 21.25% to 0.5%, outperforming a frontier Reinforcement Learning (RL) based planner."

Interestingly, the way that we retrieve information on the web has hardly changed ever since Google was established in 1998, raising concerns as to Google's dominance in search and lack of competition. If the market for search was sufficiently competitive, then we should probably see a steady increase in search quality over time as well as alternative approaches to the Google's approach to search. However, hardly any research has so far looked at search quality, which is a key facet of a competitive market, especially not over time. In this report, we conducted a relatively large-scale quantitative comparison of search quality of 1,467 search queries relating to coding advice in October 2023. We focus on coding advice because the study of general search quality is difficult, with the aim of learning more about the assessment of search quality and motivating follow-up research into this important topic. We evaluate the search quality of Google Search, Microsoft Bing, and Apple Search, with a special emphasis on Apple Search, a widely used search engine that has never been explored in previous research. For the assessment of search quality, we use two independent metrics of search quality: 1) the number of trackers on the first search result, as a measure of privacy in web search, and 2) the average rank of the first Stack Overflow search result, under the assumption that Stack Overflow gives the best coding advice. Our results suggest that the privacy of search results is higher on Bing than on Google and Apple. Similarly, the quality of coding advice -- as measured by the average rank of Stack Overflow -- was highest on Bing."

Accessibility encompasses a broad range of considerations, from infrastructure-based features such as elevators and step-free access to spatial factors such as the geographic distribution of accessible stations. In this work, we investigate infrastructure-based accessibility in two major transit systems: the London Underground and the New York City Subway. We construct network models in which nodes represent accessible stations and edges represent adjacency along transit lines. Using tools from network analysis, we examine the structural properties of these accessibility networks, including clustering patterns and the spatial distribution of accessible nodes. We further employ centrality measures to identify stations that serve as major accessible hubs. Finally, we analyze socioeconomic and tourism-related variables to assess the influence of neighborhood wealth and popularity on the prevalence of accessible stations. Our findings highlight significant disparities in accessibility across both systems and demonstrate the utility of mathematical and network-theoretic methods in understanding and improving modern transit infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective for autoregressive language models, but adapting these methods to diffusion large language models (dLLMs) presents fundamental challenges. The core difficulty lies in likelihood approximation: while autoregressive models naturally provide token-level conditional probabilities essential for token-level RL objectives (e.g., GRPO), dLLMs generate sequences through iterative non-autoregressive denoising steps that lack this factorization. To address this fundamental mismatch, we propose ELBO-based Sequence-level Policy Optimization (ESPO), a principled RL framework that treats entire sequence generation as a single action and uses the ELBO as a tractable sequence-level likelihood proxy. Our method incorporates per-token normalization of importance ratios and robust KL-divergence estimation to ensure stable large-scale training. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and planning tasks demonstrate that ESPO significantly outperforms token-level baselines, achieving dramatic improvements of 20-40 points on the Countdown task, while maintaining consistent gains on math and coding benchmarks. Our approach establishes sequence-level optimization as a principled and empirically effective paradigm for RL in dLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/ESPO."

Three gaps persist: (1) lack of joint training that integrates spatial and temporal representations, (2) origin-agnostic treatment that ignores directional asymmetries in navigation ($A \\to B \\ne B \\to A$), and (3) over-reliance on auxiliary data (POIs, imagery) rather than fundamental geometric properties of urban space. We introduce a conditional trajectory encoder that jointly learns spatial and movement representations while preserving origin-dependent asymmetries using geometric features. This framework decomposes urban navigation into shared cognitive patterns and origin-specific spatial narratives, enabling quantitative measurement of cognitive asymmetries across starting locations. Our bidirectional LSTM processes visibility ratio and curvature features conditioned on learnable origin embeddings, decomposing representations into shared urban patterns and origin-specific signatures through contrastive learning. Results from six synthetic cities and real-world validation on Beijing's Xicheng District demonstrate that urban morphology creates systematic cognitive inequalities. This provides urban planners quantitative tools for assessing experiential equity, offers architects insights into layout decisions' cognitive impacts, and enables origin-aware analytics for navigation systems."

    "abstract": "Many spintronic, magnetic-memory, and neuromorphic devices rely on spatially varying magnetic fields. Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\\approx 0.52 ~μ\\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~μ\\mathrm{m} \\times 83~μ\\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \\pm 142)~\\mathrm{nT\\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes. These results establish pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices."

    "abstract": "Multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty can be efficiently solved with the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm. However, traditional implementations require all stage problems to be feasible. Feasibility is usually enforced by adding slack variables and penalizing them in the objective function, a process that depends on case-specific calibration and often distorts the economic interpretation of results. This paper proposes the Penalty-Free SDDP, an extension that introduces a Future Feasibility Function alongside the traditional Future Cost Function. The new recursion handles infeasibilities automatically, distinguishing between temporary and truly infeasible cases, and propagates feasibility information across stages through dedicated feasibility cuts. The approach was validated in a large-scale deterministic case inspired by the Brazilian hydrothermal system, achieving equivalent feasibility to the benchmark solution while eliminating miscalibrated artificial penalties. Results confirm its robustness and practicality as a foundation for future stochastic, multi-stage applications."

    "abstract": "Reliable uncertainty quantification is essential in survival prediction, particularly in clinical settings where erroneous decisions carry high risk. Conformal prediction has attracted substantial attention as it offers a model-agnostic framework with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Extending it to right-censored outcomes poses nontrivial challenges. Several adaptations of conformal approaches for survival outcomes have been developed, but they either rely on restrictive censoring settings or substantial computation. A recent conformal approach for right-censored data constructs censoring-adjusted p-values and enables prediction intervals in general survival settings. However, the empirical coverage depends sensitively on heuristic tuning choices and its validity is limited to scenarios without covariate shift. In this paper, we establish theoretical justification for its prediction-set construction, providing a principled basis for defining prediction-set bounds, and extend the approach to covariate-shift settings. Simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust coverage and coherent interval structure across varying censoring levels and covariate-shift settings."

In this letter, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies."

However, classical RL suffers from limitations in generalization, learning feedback, interpretability, and sample efficiency in dynamic wireless environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigm with exceptional capabilities in knowledge generalization, contextual reasoning, and interactive generation, which have demonstrated strong potential to enhance classical RL. This paper serves as a comprehensive tutorial on LLM-enhanced RL for wireless networks. We propose a taxonomy to categorize the roles of LLMs into four critical functions: state perceiver, reward designer, decision-maker, and generator. Then, we review existing studies exploring how each role of LLMs enhances different stages of the RL pipeline. Moreover, we provide a series of case studies to illustrate how to design and apply LLM-enhanced RL in low-altitude economy networking, vehicular networks, and space-air-ground integrated networks. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on potential future directions for LLM-enhanced RL and offer insights into its future development in wireless networks."

It has been shown that Bi-based subwavelength optical cavities show outstanding features, including broad tuneable resonances for structural color generation and broadband perfect absorption for light harvesting. While current devices are based on continuous Bi films, integrating ultrathin films around the percolation threshold with a tailored morphology promises to enable more compact devices with a wider tunability range and/or enhanced optical response. In this context, we report the tailoring of the morphology and UV-Vis-NIR effective optical dielectric function ( $\\varepsilon$= $\\varepsilon_1$+i$\\varepsilon_2$) of ultrathin Bi films around the percolation threshold. Just below percolation, the films effective optical permittivity $\\varepsilon_1$ differs markedly from that of a continuous film, as it turns from negative to positive while its effective optical loss $\\varepsilon_2$ is reduced. We showcase the relevance of such dielectric tunability for the design of enhanced subwavelength optical cavities operating in the NIR and visible regions. In particular, we show that discontinuous near-percolation films enable designing optimized cavities for efficient colour generation with a thickness almost 3 times smaller than what was previously achieved for continuous films."

In simulation, ContactRL achieves a low safety violation rate of 0.2\\% with a high task success rate of 87.7\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art constrained RL baselines. In order to guarantee deployment safety, we augment the learned policy with a kinetic energy based Control Barrier Function (eCBF) shield. Real-world experiments on an UR3e robotic platform performing small object handovers from a human hand across 360 trials confirm safe contact, with measured normal forces consistently below 10N. These results demonstrate that ContactRL enables safe and efficient physical collaboration, thereby advancing the deployment of collaborative robots in contact-rich tasks."

As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices."

Experiments on the Multi-Session Chat (MSC) dataset demonstrate that DZ-TDPO achieves state-of-the-art win rates (86.2% on Phi-3.5) while maintaining robust zero-shot generalization. Crucially, our scaling analysis reveals a \"Capacity-Stability Trade-off\": while smaller models incur an \"alignment tax\" (perplexity surge) to overcome historical inertia, the larger Qwen2.5-7B model achieves near-perfect alignment (99.4% win rate) with negligible perplexity overhead. This confirms that TAI can be alleviated via precise attention regulation rather than destructive weight updates, preserving general capabilities (MMLU) across model scales.

The aim is to assess the applicability limits of the empirical \\emph{Beverloo law}. The system was modeled with a monodisperse particles whose mechanical properties correspond to the $Al_{95}Fe_2Cr_2Ti_1$ alloy, and interparticle contacts were described using the Hertz--Mindlin (no slip) model. The simulations systematically explored the influence of particle diameter ($d$) and bed height ($h$) on the resulting mass flow rate ($Q$). The results reveal the coexistence of transient and steady-state discharge regimes. Good agreement with the Beverloo scaling was observed for relatively small diameter ratios ($D/d = 10$) and sufficiently large bed heights, where the flow stabilizes rapidly. For larger $D/d$ ratios, the discharge rate decays exponentially, indicating a breakdown of the constant-hydrostatic-pressure assumption underlying the Beverloo model. A dimensionless criterion for the validity of the Beverloo law is proposed as $Π_h = h/D > 2$, or equivalently $N = h/d > 20$. The quantitative agreement between DEM simulations and experimental measurements for polydisperse particle size distributions further validates the computational model and demonstrates its predictive capability for granular discharge in confined geometries."

Rigorous convergence guarantees ensure stable training on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, while stability of topological signatures provides robust fraud detection. Optimized for NISQ hardware with circuit simplifications and graph sampling, the framework scales to large transaction networks. Simulations on financial datasets, such as PaySim and Elliptic, benchmark QTGNN against classical and quantum baselines, using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision, and false positive rate. An ablation study evaluates the contributions of quantum embeddings, topological features, non-linear channels, and hybrid learning.

    "abstract": "Panel data models with unobserved heterogeneity in the form of interactive effects standardly assume that the time effects - or \"common factors\" - enter linearly. This assumption is unnatural in the sense that it pertains to the unobserved component of the model, and there is rarely any reason to believe that this component takes on a particular functional form. This is in stark contrast to the relationship between the observables, which can often be credibly argued to be linear. Linearity in the factors has persevered mainly because it is convenient, and that it is better than standard fixed effects. The present paper relaxes this assumption. It does so by combining the common correlated effects (CCE) approach to standard interactive effects with the method of sieves. The new estimator - abbreviated \"SCCE\" - retains many of the advantages of CCE, including its computational simplicity, and good small-sample and asymptotic properties, but is applicable under a much broader class of factor structures that includes the linear one as a special case. This makes it well-suited for a wide range of empirical applications."

Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination."

Using a one year national consumption dataset, we conduct an extensive experimental study including ablation analyses with and without cyclical encodings and calendar features and comparisons with established baselines from the literature. Results demonstrate consistent improvements across all seven forecast horizons, with our hybrid model achieving lower RMSE and MAE than individual architectures and prior methods.

While previous research has selectively examined head or hand movements, here we explore movements of the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesized that increasing background noise in conversations would lead to increased gesture frequency in hand, head, trunk, and leg movements typical of conversation. Increased use of hand movements should support the speaker's role, while increased head and trunk movements may help the listener. We conducted a free dyadic conversation experiment with normal-hearing participants (n=8) in a virtual acoustic environment. Conversational movements were described with a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational actions, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed gesture quality by assessing hand-speech synchrony, with the hypothesis that higher levels of background noise would lead to a loss of synchrony according to an interactive coupling model. Higher noise levels led to increased hand-gesture complexity during speaking and listening, more pronounced up-down head movements, and contrary to expectations, head movements during listening generally decreased relative to speaking. Synchrony and peak velocity were unaffected by noise, while gesture quality scaled only modestly. The results support previous findings regarding gesturing frequency, but we found only limited evidence for changes in speech-gesture synchrony. This work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and illustrates multimodal adaptation to communication demands."

Actuation was performed individually on the leeward and windward side as well as simultaneously. We measured both axial and side force components with a load cell. A laminar separation bubble on both sides of the truck's cabin is identified with particle image velocimetry. The plasma actuators effectively reduce the axial force on the GTS, and higher force reduction is achieved with symmetric actuation. The leeward actuation is found to have a greater control authority than the windward one; at large side-wind angle the latter has a negligible effect on the axial force. Concerning the side force, the leeward actuation produces a drop in its magnitude while windward actuation produces an increase. Interestingly, actuating symmetrically also augments the side force. The plasma actuator causes a reduction in the length and width of the separation bubble on the cabin side, reducing the apparent frontal area of the truck and thus its drag. Under side wind conditions, the leeward actuator has stronger authority since reduces the size of the larger separation bubble. The side force is also weakened via the diminution of the larger recirculation region, reducing its lateral suction force."

    "abstract": "We report the existence of multi-peaked vector soliton families in normally dispersive passive Kerr resonators. Through cross-phase modulation between two orthogonal polarization components, each peak becomes tightly interlocked, enabling robust localization of the entire wave packet in defocusing cavities. Analysis using snakes-and-ladder diagrams demonstrates the diversity of these vector soliton families, which include dark-bright multi-peak solitons, flat-topped solitons, and modulation instability patterns, among others. Furthermore, stability analysis based on the coupled Lugiato-Lefever equations reveals that specific combinations of parameters can sustain stable vector cavity solitons, whose peak numbers can be continuously tuned by adding appropriate perturbations. These findings significantly expand the scope of soliton dynamics and optical frequency comb generation in pumped-dissipative systems, independent of dispersion conditions."

    "abstract": "Despite their electronic dominance, cubic diamond structured Si and Ge, are optoelectronically deficient. Recent work indicates, however, that a volume-expanded hexagonal Ge modification can exhibit intensely sought, superior optoelectronic characteristics. If larger Sn could form a hexagonal solid solution with Ge, this would achieve this expansion. But this was not expected because Ge and Sn are unreactive at ambient conditions, Sn does not have an ambient hexagonal symmetry, and only cubic or tetragonal binary modifications could be prepared under any conditions including thin film processing. This state of affairs is categorically changed here by subjecting Ge and Sn to pressures of 9 and 10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K using large-volume press methods. Synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy reveal ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H and 6H Ge-Sn solid solutions (P63/mmc). Formation of this new binary materials landscape is correlated with Sn uptake, with the hexagonal symmetry being accessible below 21 atom % Sn and the cubic diamond symmetry at or above this value. The findings form fertile routes to advanced materials, by in tandem creating reactivity with pressure and directing production of needed crystal symmetries with composition, as well as opportunity to tune properties based on crystal symmetry, composition, and stacking sequence for optoelectronic applications.

We find that multi-component burst-clusters show spectral properties similar to single-peak bursts, and no periodicity is detected in their temporal behavior. The component-count distributions follow a power law, revealing scale-free behavior consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) processes. Multi-component clusters account for 12-30% of all detected bursts, regardless of source activity, providing new insights into burst-to-burst variability and the physical processes driving FRB emission."

    "abstract": "The performance of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, an approach to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, is limited by the finite squeezing capabilities of current experimental platforms. To circumvent this hardware demand, we introduce Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ES-ZNE), a quantum error mitigation protocol that uses the mean photon number of the GKP code as a tunable effective noise parameter. The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes. These results establish ES-ZNE as a practical, software-based strategy for enhancing the performance of near-term bosonic quantum processors, trading sampling overhead for demanding physical resources like high squeezing."

As consequence of the Newelski-Pillay conjecture, the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of invariant types are abstractly isomorphic to the Ellis subgroups of the semigroup of finitely satisfiable types in the definable amenable NIP setting. We are interested in the existence of natural isomorphisms from invariant Ellis subgroups to finitely satisfiable Ellis subgroups and we determine when these isomorphisms can be witnessed by variants of the canonical NIP retraction map. Several limiting examples are provided.

This work explores various techniques for SIMD vectorization to improve the pairwise force calculation between molecules in the scope of the particle simulation library AutoPas. The focus lies on the order in which particle values are loaded into vector registers to achieve the most optimal performance regarding execution time or energy consumption. As previous work indicates that the optimal MD algorithm can change during runtime, this paper investigates simulation-specific parameters like particle density and the impact of the neighbor identification algorithms, which distinguishes this work from related projects. Furthermore, AutoPas' dynamic tuning mechanism is extended to choose the optimal vectorization order during runtime. The benchmarks show that considering different particle interaction orders during runtime can lead to a considerable performance improvement for the force calculation compared to AutoPas' previous approach."

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

This design enables PARC to detect and correct high-level strategic errors and sustain progress without human intervention. We evaluate PARC across computational science and data science tasks. In materials science, it autonomously reproduces key results from studies on lithium-ion conduction and alloy segregation. In particular, it coordinates dozens of parallel simulation tasks, each requiring roughly 43 hours of computation, managing orchestration, monitoring, and error correction end-to-end. In Kaggle-based experiments, starting from minimal natural-language instructions, PARC conducts data analysis and implements search strategies, producing solutions competitive with human-engineered baselines. These results highlight the potential of integrating a hierarchical multi-agent system with self-assessment and self-feedback to enable AI systems capable of independent, large-scale scientific and analytical work."

We formulate this learning task as a convex optimization problem using decision-focused learning techniques and solve it by differentiating through the higher and the lower level problems in our architecture. To ensure robustness, we derive out-of-sample performance guarantees using conformal prediction. Numerical experiments in facility location, knapsack problems, and vehicle routing problems demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computation time while maintaining feasibility and high solution quality compared to state-of-the-art solvers."

We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients.

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities."

Using Ku-band data (12 to 18 GHz) from the Very Large Array and K-band data (17 to 25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of $α$ = $-0.88 \\pm 0.10$. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free-free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons."

    "abstract": "Robots are often required to localize in environments with unknown object classes and semantic ambiguity. However, when performing global localization using semantic objects, high semantic ambiguity intensifies object misclassification and increases the likelihood of incorrect associations, which in turn can cause significant errors in the estimated pose. Thus, in this letter, we propose a multi-label likelihood-based semantic graph matching framework for object-level global localization. The key idea is to exploit multi-label graph representations, rather than single-label alternatives, to capture and leverage the inherent semantic context of object observations. Based on these representations, our approach enhances semantic correspondence across graphs by combining the likelihood of each node with the maximum likelihood of its neighbors via context-aware likelihood propagation. For rigorous validation, data association and pose estimation performance are evaluated under both closed-set and open-set detection configurations. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to large-vocabulary object categories in both real-world indoor scenes and synthetic environments."

This adaptive approach facilitates the conveyance of extra bits to the receiver, which means it needs less cost of radio-frequency chains at transmitter while improving SE. Besides, the proposed schemes offer an inherent PLS security advantage, as the eavesdropper is unable to completely detect signals reflected from the RIS. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed RASM and RASSK schemes, this paper presents a detailed analytical performance of their spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate, which are accompanied by insightful findings and conclusions. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes, showcasing their improved error performance and robustness against wiretapping, while also highlighting the potential of the RASM and RASSK schemes for future wireless applications."

    "abstract": "We develop a complex-entropy framework for Wigner negativity and apply it to avoided crossings in an oval quantum billiard. For a real Wigner function the Gibbs--Shannon functional becomes complex; its imaginary part, proportional to the Wigner-negative volume, serves as an entropy-like measure of phase-space nonclassicality. A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied. This structure yields a Cauchy--Schwarz bound that limits how rapidly the imaginary entropy, and hence the Wigner negativity, can change with the parameter. In the oval billiard, avoided crossings display enhanced negativity and an amplified negative-channel Fisher response, providing a clear phase-space signature of mode hybridization. The construction is generic and extends to other wave-chaotic and mesoscopic systems with phase-space representations."

    "abstract": "Event-based models (EBMs) infer disease progression from cross-sectional data, and standard EBMs assume a single underlying disease per individual. In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD."

    "abstract": "In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfvénic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations."

We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients. These findings demonstrate that combining engineered features with lightweight architectures can support accurate, rapid, and generalizable detection of type 2 diabetes in real-world wearable settings."

Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. \"In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one.\" Armed with this understanding, we framed $\\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack."

Conventional encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) incur large area overheads and performance penalties, motivating lightweight XOR-based in-situ encryption schemes with low area and power requirements. This work proposes an ultra-dense single-transistor encrypted cell using ferroelectric FET (FeFET) devices, which, to our knowledge, is the first to eliminate the two-memory-devices-per-encrypted-cell requirement in XOR-based schemes, enabling encrypted memory arrays to maintain the same number of storage devices as unencrypted arrays. The key idea is an in-memory single-FeFET XOR scheme, where the ciphertext is encoded in the device threshold voltage and leverages the direction-dependent current flow of the FeFET for single-cycle decryption; eliminating complementary bit storage also removes the need for two write cycles, allowing faster encryption. We extend the approach to multi-level-cell (MLC) FeFETs to store multiple bits per transistor. We validate the proposed idea through both simulation and experimental evaluations. Our analysis on a 128x128-bit array shows 2x higher encryption/decryption throughput than prior FeFET work and 45.2x/14.12x improvement over AES, while application-level evaluations using neural-network benchmarks demonstrate average latency reductions of 50% and 95% compared to prior FeFET-based and AES-based schemes, respectively."

To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored."

However, state-of-the-art neural motion planners are primarily trained on small datasets collected in manually generated workspaces, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution scenarios. Additionally, these planners often rely on monolithic network architectures that struggle to encode critical planning information. To address these challenges, we introduce Motion Policy with Dataset Synthesis powered by large language models (LLMs) and Fusion Action-Chunking Transformers (PerFACT), which incorporates two key components. Firstly, a novel LLM-powered workspace generation method, MotionGeneralizer, enables large-scale planning data collection by producing a diverse set of semantically feasible workspaces. Secondly, we introduce Fusion Motion Policy Networks (MpiNetsFusion), a generalist neural motion planner that uses a fusion action-chunking transformer to better encode planning signals and attend to multiple feature modalities. Leveraging MotionGeneralizer, we collect 3.5M trajectories to train and evaluate MpiNetsFusion against state-of-the-art planners, which shows that the proposed MpiNetsFusion can plan several times faster on the evaluated tasks."

    "abstract": "Mimicking human behavior to actively learning from general experience and achieve artificial general intelligence has always been a human dream. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) based large-thinking models demonstrate impressive expert-level abilities, i.e., software and math, but still rely heavily on verifiable rewards in specific domains, placing a significant bottleneck to extend the performance boundary of general reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose PretrainZero, a reinforcement active learning framework built on the pretraining corpus to extend RL from domain-specific post-training to general pretraining. PretrainZero features the following characteristics: 1) Active pretraining: inspired by the active learning ability of humans, PretrainZero learns a unified reasoning policy to actively identify reasonable and informative contents from pretraining corpus, and reason to predict these contents by RL. 2) Self-supervised learning: without any verifiable labels, pretrained reward models, or supervised fine-tuning, we directly pretrain reasoners from 3 to 30B base models on the general Wikipedia corpus using RL, significantly breaking the verification data-wall for general reasoning. 3) Verification scaling: by tackling increasingly challenging masked spans, PretrainZero substantially enhances the general reasoning abilities of pretrained base models. In reinforcement pretraining, PretrainZero improves Qwen3-4B-Base for 8.43, 5.96 and 10.60 on MMLU-Pro, SuperGPQA and math average benchmarks. In post-training, the pretrained models can also serve as reasoning foundation models for downstream RLVR tasks."

Traditional recommendation systems often lack explainability and suffer from issues such as popularity bias. Previous research has also indicated that LLMs, when used as standalone predictors, fail to achieve accuracy comparable to traditional models. To address these challenges, we propose to use LLM as an explainable re-ranker, a hybrid approach that combines traditional recommendation models with LLMs to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. We constructed a dataset to train the re-ranker LLM and evaluated the alignment between the generated dataset and human expectations. Leveraging a two-stage training process, our model significantly improved NDCG, a key ranking metric. Moreover, the re-ranker outperformed a zero-shot baseline in ranking accuracy and interpretability. These results highlight the potential of integrating traditional recommendation models with LLMs to address limitations in existing systems and pave the way for more explainable and fair recommendation frameworks."

We compare applying standard unlearning methods before versus after the grokking transition across vision (CNNs/ResNets on CIFAR, SVHN, and ImageNet) and language (a transformer on a TOFU-style setup). Starting from grokked checkpoints consistently yields (i) more efficient forgetting (fewer updates to reach a target forget level), (ii) less collateral damage (smaller drops on retained and test performance), and (iii) more stable updates across seeds, relative to early-stopped counterparts under identical unlearning algorithms. Analyses of features and curvature further suggest that post-grokking models learn more modular representations with reduced gradient alignment between forget and retain subsets, which facilitates selective forgetting. Our results highlight when a model is trained (pre- vs. post-grokking) as an orthogonal lever to how unlearning is performed, providing a practical recipe to improve existing unlearning methods without altering their algorithms."

However, its relevance to thermally aged materials, where both toughness and work of fracture degrade dramatically, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that despite severe thermal embrittlement, the fractocohesive length remains invariant throughout thermal aging, independent of temperature or duration. We verify this invariance experimentally for two elastomer systems (Styrene Butadiene Rubber and Silicone Rubber) at multiple aging temperatures for aging times up to eight weeks. This finding bridges a critical gap in fracture mechanics of aged polymers: while the evolution of work-to-fracture can be predicted from well-established constitutive models that track network changes (crosslink density and chain scission), the evolution of fracture toughness has lacked predictive frameworks. The invariance of fractocohesive length enables direct calculation of fracture toughness at any aging state from the predicted work of fracture, eliminating the need for extensive fracture testing on aged elastomers and providing a crucial missing link for computational fracture predictions in aged elastomeric components."

Specifically, DM3D introduces an offset-guided Gaussian sequencing mechanism that unifies local resampling and global reordering within a deformable scan. The Gaussian-based KNN Resampling (GKR) enhances structural awareness by adaptively reorganizing neighboring points, while the Gaussian-based Differentiable Reordering (GDR) enables end-to-end optimization of serialization order. Furthermore, a Tri-Path Frequency Fusion module enhances feature complementarity and reduces aliasing. Together, these components enable structure-adaptive serialization of point clouds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DM3D achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, few-shot learning, and part segmentation, demonstrating that adaptive serialization effectively unlocks the potential of SSMs for point cloud understanding."

Solutions to the steady boundary-layer equations reveal a thin nanoparticle concentration layer near the plate surface, with a characteristic thickness of $O({\\Rey}^{-1/2}{Sc}^{-1/3})$, for a Reynolds number $\\Rey$ and Schmidt number $Sc$. When Brownian motion and thermophoresis are neglected, this nanoparticle concentration layer disappears, resulting in a uniform concentration across the boundary layer. Neutral stability curves and critical conditions for the onset of the Tollmien--Schlichting wave are computed for a range of nanoparticle materials and volume concentrations. Results indicate that while the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis are negligible, the impact of nanoparticle density is significant. Denser nanoparticles, such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), destabilise the Tollmien--Schlichting wave, whereas lighter nanoparticles, like aluminium (Al) and silicon (Si), establish a small stabilising effect. Additionally, stability characteristics are influenced by the viscosity model. Finally, a high-Reynolds number asymptotic analysis is undertaken for the lower branch of the neutral stability curve."

However, this framework, which often assumes a universal critical point, fails to account for the extensive individual variability observed in neural dynamics and cognitive functions. These variabilities are not noise but rather an inherent manifestation of a fundamental systems-biology principle: the necessary trade-off between robustness and flexibility in human populations. Here, we propose that the Griffiths phase (GP), an extended critical regime synergically induced by two kinds of heterogeneities in brain network region and connectivity, offers a unified framework for brain criticality that better reconciles robustness and flexibility and accounts for individual variability. Using Human Connectome Project data and whole-brain modeling, we demonstrated that the synergic interplay between structural network modularity and regional heterogeneity in local excitability yields biologically viable GP featured with widely extended global excitability ranges, with an embedded optimal point that balances global/local information transmission. Crucially, an individua's position within the GP gives rise to unique global network dynamics, which in turn confer a distinctive cognitive profile via flexible configuration of functional connectivity for segregation, integration, and balance between them. These results establish GP as an evolved adaptive mechanism resolving the robustness-flexibility trade-off, fulfilling diverse cognitive demands through individualized criticality landscapes, providing a new framework of brain criticality."

To address this issue, we propose MOS, a novel framework designed to mitigate the optical-SAR modality gap and achieve modality-consistent feature learning for optical-SAR cross-modal ship ReID. MOS consists of two core components: (1) Modality-Consistent Representation Learning (MCRL) applies denoise SAR image procession and a class-wise modality alignment loss to align intra-identity feature distributions across modalities. (2) Cross-modal Data Generation and Feature fusion (CDGF) leverages a brownian bridge diffusion model to synthesize cross-modal samples, which are subsequently fused with original features during inference to enhance alignment and discriminability. Extensive experiments on the HOSS ReID dataset demonstrate that MOS significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation protocols, achieving notable improvements of +3.0%, +6.2%, and +16.4% in R1 accuracy under the ALL to ALL, Optical to SAR, and SAR to Optical settings, respectively.

Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions."

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable of generating persuasive content, understanding their effectiveness across different advertising strategies becomes critical. This paper presents a two-part investigation examining LLM-generated advertising through complementary lenses: (1) personality-based and (2) psychological persuasion principles. In our first study (n=400), we tested whether LLMs could generate personalized advertisements tailored to specific personality traits (openness and neuroticism) and how their performance compared to human experts. Results showed that LLM-generated ads achieved statistical parity with human-written ads (51.1% vs. 48.9%, p > 0.05), with no significant performance differences for matched personalities. Building on these insights, our second study (n=800) shifted focus from individual personalization to universal persuasion, testing LLM performance across four foundational psychological principles: authority, consensus, cognition, and scarcity. AI-generated ads significantly outperformed human-created content, achieving a 59.1% preference rate (vs. 40.9%, p < 0.001), with the strongest performance in authority (63.0%) and consensus (62.5%) appeals. Qualitative analysis revealed AI's advantage stems from crafting more sophisticated, aspirational messages and achieving superior visual-narrative coherence. Critically, this quality advantage proved robust: even after applying a 21.2 percentage point detection penalty when participants correctly identified AI-origin, AI ads still outperformed human ads, and 29.4% of participants chose AI content despite knowing its origin. These findings demonstrate LLMs' evolution from parity in personalization to superiority in persuasive storytelling, with significant implications for advertising practice given LLMs' near-zero marginal cost and time requirements compared to human experts."

    "abstract": "We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless networks, offering superior transmission efficiency by extracting and conveying task-relevant semantic latent representations rather than raw data. However, the openness of the wireless medium and the intrinsic vulnerability of semantic latent representations expose such systems to previously unrecognized security risks. In this paper, we uncover a fundamental latent-space vulnerability that enables Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker to covertly manipulate the transmitted semantics while preserving the statistical properties of the transmitted latent representations. We first present a Diffusion-based Re-encoding Attack (DiR), wherein the attacker employs a diffusion model to synthesize an attacker-designed semantic variant, and re-encodes it into a valid latent representation compatible with the SemCom decoder. Beyond this model-dependent pathway, we further propose a model-agnostic and training-free Test-Time Adaptation Latent Manipulation attack (TTA-LM), in which the attacker perturbs and steers the intercepted latent representation toward an attacker-specified semantic target by leveraging the gradient of a target loss function. In contrast to diffusion-based manipulation, TTA-LM does not rely on any generative model and does not impose modality-specific or task-specific assumptions, thereby enabling efficient and broadly applicable latent-space tampering across diverse SemCom architectures. Extensive experiments on representative semantic communication architectures demonstrate that both attacks can significantly alter the decoded semantics while preserving natural latent-space distributions, making the attacks covert and difficult to detect."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become foundational in AI systems, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks. These attacks involve carefully crafted prompts that bypass safety guardrails and induce models to produce harmful content. Detecting such malicious input queries is therefore critical for maintaining LLM safety. Existing methods for jailbreak detection typically involve fine-tuning LLMs as static safety LLMs using fixed training datasets. However, these methods incur substantial computational costs when updating model parameters to improve robustness, especially in the face of novel jailbreak attacks. Inspired by immunological memory mechanisms, we propose the Multi-Agent Adaptive Guard (MAAG) framework for jailbreak detection. The core idea is to equip guard with memory capabilities: upon encountering novel jailbreak attacks, the system memorizes attack patterns, enabling it to rapidly and accurately identify similar threats in future encounters. Specifically, MAAG first extracts activation values from input prompts and compares them to historical activations stored in a memory bank for quick preliminary detection. A defense agent then simulates responses based on these detection results, and an auxiliary agent supervises the simulation process to provide secondary filtering of the detection outcomes. Extensive experiments across five open-source models demonstrate that MAAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 98% detection accuracy and a 96% F1-score across a diverse range of attack scenarios."

Graphical threat models are a recommended tool to analyze and communicate threat information. However, the comparison of different graphical threat models, and the acceptability of these threat models for an audience with a limited technical background, is not well understood, despite these users making up a sizable portion of the cybersecurity industry. We seek to compare the acceptability of three general, graphical threat models, Attack-Defense Trees (ADTs), Attack Graphs (AGs), and CORAS, for users with a limited technical background. We conducted a laboratory study with 38 bachelor students who completed tasks with the three threat models across three different scenarios assigned using a Latin square design. Threat model submissions were qualitatively analyzed, and participants filled out a perception questionnaire based on the Method Evaluation Model (MEM). We find that both ADTs and CORAS are broadly acceptable for a wide range of scenarios, and both could be applied successfully by users with a limited technical background; further, we also find that the lack of a specific tool for AGs may have impacted the perceived usefulness of AGs. We can recommend that users with a limited technical background use ADTs or CORAS as a general graphical TM method. Further research on the acceptability of AGs to such an audience and the effect of a dedicated TM tool support is needed."

SeeU first reconstructs the 4D world from sparse and monocular 2D frames (2D$\\to$4D). It then learns the continuous 4D dynamics on a low-rank representation and physical constraints (discrete 4D$\\to$continuous 4D). Finally, SeeU rolls the world forward in time, re-projects it back to 2D at sampled times and viewpoints, and generates unseen regions based on spatial-temporal context awareness (4D$\\to$2D). By modeling dynamics in 4D, SeeU achieves continuous and physically-consistent novel visual generation, demonstrating strong potentials in multiple tasks including unseen temporal generation, unseen spatial generation, and video editing."

Using large language models, we automatically labeled topic, genre, and discourse-pragmatic functions across a total of 3,691 code-switched sentences, integrated demographic metadata from the Miami Bilingual Corpus, and enriched the Spanish-Guaraní dataset with new topic annotations. The resulting distributions reveal systematic links between gender, language dominance, and discourse function in the Miami data, and a clear diglossic division between formal Guaraní and informal Spanish in Paraguayan texts. These findings replicate and extend earlier interactional and sociolinguistic observations with corpus-scale quantitative evidence. The study demonstrates that large language models can reliably recover interpretable sociolinguistic patterns traditionally accessible only through manual annotation, advancing computational methods for cross-linguistic and low-resource bilingual research."

    "abstract": "Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\\pm$8 $μ$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\\pm$3 $μ$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts."

The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method."

    "abstract": "Memory and computation remain core bottlenecks in long-horizon LLM inference due to the quadratic cost of self-attention and the ever-growing key-value (KV) cache. Existing strategies for memory-bounded inference, such as quantization, offloading, or heuristic KV eviction, either incur high orchestration costs or rely on unreliable attention-based proxies of importance. We propose TRIM-KV, a novel approach that learns each token's intrinsic importance at creation time via a lightweight retention gate. Each gate predicts a scalar retention score that decays over time, reflecting the long-term utility of the token for a specific layer and head. Tokens with low scores are evicted when the memory budget is exceeded, ensuring that the cache always contains the most critical tokens. TRIM-KV is trained efficiently through distillation from a frozen LLM combined with a capacity loss, requiring only gate fine-tuning and adding negligible inference overhead. Across mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH-500, AIME24), procedural generation (LongProc), conversational long-memory benchmarks (LongMemEval), and long-context understanding (LongBench and SCBench), TRIM-KV consistently outperforms strong eviction and learnable retrieval baselines, especially in low-memory regimes. Remarkably, it even surpasses full-cache models in some settings, showing that selective retention can serve as a form of regularization, suppressing noise from uninformative tokens. Qualitative analyses further reveal that learned retention scores align with human intuition, naturally recovering heuristics such as sink tokens, sliding windows, and gist compression without explicit design. Beyond efficiency, retention scores provide insights into layer- and head-specific roles, suggesting a new path toward LLM interpretability."

We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning."

    "abstract": "Mock galaxy catalogues are often constructed from dark-matter-only simulations based on the galaxy-halo connection. Although modern mocks can reproduce galaxy clustering to some extent, the absence of baryons affects the spatial and kinematic distributions of galaxies in ways that remain insufficiently quantified. We compare the positions and velocities of satellite galaxies in the MTNG hydrodynamic simulation with those in its dark-matter-only counterpart, assessing how baryonic effects influence galaxy clustering and contrasting them with the impact of galaxy selection, i.e. the dependence of clustering on sample definition. Using merger trees from both runs, we track satellite subhaloes until they become centrals, allowing us to match systems even when their z=0 positions differ. We then compute positional and velocity offsets as functions of halo mass and distance from the halo centre, and use these to construct a subhalo catalogue from the dark-matter-only simulation that reproduces the galaxy distribution in the hydrodynamic run. Satellites in the hydrodynamic simulation lie 3-4% closer to halo centres than in the dark-matter-only case, with an offset that is nearly constant with halo mass and increases toward smaller radii. Satellite velocities are also systematically higher in the dark-matter-only run. At scales of 0.1 Mpc/h, these spatial and kinematic differences produce 10-20% variations in clustering amplitude -corresponding to 1-3$σ$ assuming DESI-like errors- though the impact decreases at larger scales. These baryonic effects are relevant for cosmological and lensing analyses and should be accounted for when building high-fidelity mocks. However, they remain smaller than the differences introduced by galaxy selection, which thus represents the dominant source of uncertainty when constructing mocks based on observable quantities."

    "abstract": "[Abridged] The primary gravitational waves (PGWs) are generated in the early universe from the quantum vacuum during inflation. In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended."

The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\\ast} \\approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\\ast} \\approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $Δ(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions."

We show that the optimization problem reduces to a quadratic program (QP) once the signs of the nonzero coefficients are specified. In this case, the compatibility constant can be obtained by solving QPs for all possible sign combinations. We also formulate a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) approach that can be applied when the number of true nonzero coefficients is moderately large. We investigate the finite-sample behavior of the compatibility constant for simulated data under a wide variety of parameter settings and compare the mean squared error with its theoretical error bound based on the compatibility constant.

    "abstract": "Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "In 2014, Keevash proved the existence of $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems (equivalently $K_q^r$-decompositions of $K_n^r$) for all large enough $n$ satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions. In 2021, Glock, Kühn, and Osthus proposed a generalization of this result. Namely they conjectured a hypergraph version of Nash-Williams' Conjecture positing that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has minimum $(r-1)$-degree (denoted $δ(G)$ hereafter) at least $\\left(1-Θ_r\\left(\\frac{1}{q^{r-1}}\\right)\\right) \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition. The best known progress on this conjecture dates to the second proof of the Existence Conjecture by Glock, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus wherein they showed that $δ(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{2r}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for large enough $n$, where $c$ is a constant depending on $r$ but not $q$. As for the fractional relaxation, the best known bound is due to Delcourt, Lesgourgues, and the second author, who proved that $δ(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ guarantees a $K_q^r$-fractional decomposition. We prove that for every integer $r\\ge 2$, there exists a real $c>0$ such that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ satisfies $δ(G)\\ge \\max\\left\\{ δ_{K_q^r}^* + \\varepsilon,~~1 -\\frac{c}{\\binom{q}{r-1}} \\right\\} \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition for all large enough $n$, where $δ_{K_q^r}^*$ denotes the fractional $K_q^r$-decomposition threshold. Combined with the fractional result above, this proves that $\\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for the Hypergraph Nash-Williams' Conjecture, approximately confirming the correct order of $q$. Our proof uses the newly developed method of refined absorption; we also develop a non-uniform Turán theory to prove the existence of many embeddings of absorbers which may be of independent interest."

    "abstract": "To handle underspecified or ambiguous queries, AI assistants need a policy for managing their uncertainty to determine (a) when to guess the user intent and answer directly, (b) when to enumerate and answer multiple possible intents, and (c) when to ask a clarifying question. However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this work, we propose to train steerable policies for managing this uncertainty using self-play. Given two agents, one simulating a user and the other an AI assistant, we generate conversations where the user issues a potentially ambiguous query, and the assistant needs to determine how to respond. Importantly, the model takes as input the numerical cost of each clarification question, and each generated word, and is asked to take the action that will maximize its final reward, which is the cost-penalized accuracy. We use Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) to train our model to achieve high reward and show this leads to a steerable policy that changes its behavior predictably conditioned on the provided costs, leading to higher reward and accuracy. Moreover, our procedure also generalizes to numerical cost values that were unobserved at training time."

For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy."

We compute the diffuse electromagnetic emission from a cosmological population of such supermassive DSs and their black hole remnants, tracking the entire DS history and including thermal surface radiation, DM annihilation in adiabatically contracted halos as well as late-time emission from DM overdensity spikes around the resulting black holes.

Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings.

Therefore, in this paper, we streamline the traditional redundant structure, simplify and optimize the task objective, and design a new sign language generative model called Stable Signer. It redefines the SLP task as a hierarchical generation end-to-end task that only includes text understanding (Prompt2Gloss, Text2Gloss) and Pose2Vid, and executes text understanding through our proposed new Sign Language Understanding Linker called SLUL, and generates hand gestures through the named SLP-MoE hand gesture rendering expert block to end-to-end generate high-quality and multi-style sign language videos. SLUL is trained using the newly developed Semantic-Aware Gloss Masking Loss (SAGM Loss). Its performance has improved by 48.6% compared to the current SOTA generation methods."

While numerical approaches exist for studying the time evolution of the quantum nuclear density matrix, an interpretable analytical framework to explicitly analyze the influence of quantum fluctuations on nuclear dynamics remains lacking. In this work, we present an analytical quantum theory of nonlinear phononics. This framework is a basis for deriving models of realistic materials, allowing for exact solutions of the nuclear time evolution with full consideration of quantum fluctuations. This is accomplished by treating for all possible third- and fourth-order phonon couplings and expressing forces as analytic functions of such fluctuations. We provide an analytic proof that, in general, a strong pulse displacing a phonon mode from equilibrium induces the quenching, or squeezing, of its quantum lattice fluctuations. This finding, which establishes a systematization of the mechanism observed in Ref. 1, introduces a new paradigm in nonlinear phononics, harnessing this cooling effect to drive symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric materials."

However, most existing approaches address only one of these aspects in isolation, as achieving all three simultaneously is highly challenging-for example, long-term memory mechanisms often degrade real-time performance. In this work, we present RELIC, a unified framework that tackles these three challenges altogether. Given a single image and a text description, RELIC enables memory-aware, long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time. Built upon recent autoregressive video-diffusion distillation techniques, our model represents long-horizon memory using highly compressed historical latent tokens encoded with both relative actions and absolute camera poses within the KV cache. This compact, camera-aware memory structure supports implicit 3D-consistent content retrieval and enforces long-term coherence with minimal computational overhead. In parallel, we fine-tune a bidirectional teacher video model to generate sequences beyond its original 5-second training horizon, and transform it into a causal student generator using a new memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm that enables full-context distillation over long-duration teacher as well as long student self-rollouts. Implemented as a 14B-parameter model and trained on a curated Unreal Engine-rendered dataset, RELIC achieves real-time generation at 16 FPS while demonstrating more accurate action following, more stable long-horizon streaming, and more robust spatial-memory retrieval compared with prior work. These capabilities establish RELIC as a strong foundation for the next generation of interactive world modeling."

Prior works applying group-theoretic priors or modeling transformations typically operate in the high-dimensional data space, where group actions apply uniformly across the entire input, making it difficult to disentangle the subspace that varies under transformations. While latent-space methods offer greater flexibility, they still require manual partitioning of latent variables into equivariant and invariant subspaces, limiting the ability to robustly learn and operate group actions within the representation space. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework that for the first time learns group actions on latent image manifolds, automatically discovering transformation-relevant structures without manual intervention. Our method uses learnable binary masks with straight-through estimation to dynamically partition latent representations into transformation-sensitive and invariant components. We formulate this within a unified optimization framework that jointly learns latent disentanglement and group transformation mappings. The framework can be seamlessly integrated with any standard encoder-decoder architecture. We validate our approach on five 2D/3D image datasets, demonstrating its ability to automatically learn disentangled latent factors for group actions in diverse data, while downstream classification tasks confirm the effectiveness of the learned representations.

Our work covers results for the 11 types of anisotropy that arise from the classical 7 crystal systems, as well as findings for 4 additional non-crystal anisotropies derived from the cylindrical, spherical, and icosahedral symmetry systems. Polynomial completeness and irreducibility of the proposed integrity bases are proven using the Molien series and, in addition, with established results for scalar-valued invariant sets from the literature. Furthermore, we derive relationships between a set of multiple structural tensors that specify a symmetry group and a description using only a single structural tensor. Both can be used to construct irreducible integrity bases by applying the proposed analytical-numerical method. The provided invariant sets are of great importance for modeling anisotropic materials via the structural tensor concept using both classical models as well as modern approaches based on machine learning. Alongside the results presented, this article also aims to provide an introductory overview of the complex field of modeling anisotropic materials."

We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $Ω_\\text{GW}\\sim k^{n_\\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$."

We provide an in-depth characterization of multi-class CE optimization dynamics beyond the convex regime by analyzing a canonical two-layer linear neural network with standard-basis vectors as inputs: the simplest non-convex extension for which the implicit bias remained unknown. This model coincides with the unconstrained features model used to study neural collapse, making our work the first to prove that gradient flow on CE converges to the neural collapse geometry. We construct an explicit Lyapunov function that establishes global convergence, despite the presence of spurious critical points in the non-convex landscape. A key insight underlying our analysis is an inconspicuous finding: Hadamard Initialization diagonalizes the softmax operator, freezing the singular vectors of the weight matrices and reducing the dynamics entirely to their singular values. This technique opens a pathway for analyzing CE training dynamics well beyond our specific setting considered here."

    "abstract": "Traffic state estimation (TSE) becomes challenging when probe-vehicle penetration is low and observations are spatially sparse. Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have explored combining them by embedding physical structure into Gaussian process. These approaches typically introduce the governing equations as soft constraints through pseudo-observations, enabling the integration of model structure within a variational framework. However, these methods rely heavily on penalty tuning and lack principled uncertainty calibration, which makes them sensitive to model mis-specification. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a novel Physics-Embedded Gaussian Process (PEGP), designed to integrate domain knowledge with data-driven methods in traffic state estimation. Specifically, we design two multi-output kernels informed by classic traffic flow models, constructed via the explicit application of the linearized differential operator. Experiments on HighD, NGSIM show consistent improvements over non-physics baselines. PEGP-ARZ proves more reliable under sparse observation, while PEGP-LWR achieves lower errors with denser observation. Ablation study further reveals that PEGP-ARZ residuals align closely with physics and yield calibrated, interpretable uncertainty, whereas PEGP-LWR residuals are more orthogonal and produce nearly constant variance fields. This PEGP framework combines physical priors, uncertainty quantification, which can provide reliable support for TSE."

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of Cauchy problems for weak solutions to second-order degenerate parabolic equations with a non-smooth, time-dependent degenerate elliptic part that includes both bounded and unbounded lower-order terms. The unbounded lower-order terms are allowed to lie in mixed time-space Lebesgue or even Lorentz spaces. Our notion of weak solutions is formulated under minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions. We also establish $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates for the fundamental solution and derive Gaussian upper bounds under the weak assumption of Moser's $L^2$-$L^\\infty$ estimates for weak solutions. Our approach is purely variational and avoids any a priori regularity assumptions on weak solutions or regularization via smooth approximations. Two key ingredients are norm inequalities for fractional powers of the degenerate Laplacian, and a set of embeddings that ensure time continuity of weak solutions, extending the classical Lions regularity theorem and accommodating a wide class of source terms."

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning often relies on behavior regularization that enforces policies to remain close to the dataset distribution. However, such approaches fail to distinguish between high-value and low-value actions in their regularization components. We introduce Guided Flow Policy (GFP), which couples a multi-step flow-matching policy with a distilled one-step actor. The actor directs the flow policy through weighted behavior cloning to focus on cloning high-value actions from the dataset rather than indiscriminately imitating all state-action pairs. In turn, the flow policy constrains the actor to remain aligned with the dataset's best transitions while maximizing the critic. This mutual guidance enables GFP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across 144 state and pixel-based tasks from the OGBench, Minari, and D4RL benchmarks, with substantial gains on suboptimal datasets and challenging tasks.

Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects."

    "abstract": "Tuning-free face personalization methods have developed along two distinct paradigms: text embedding approaches that map facial features into the text embedding space, and adapter-based methods that inject features through auxiliary cross-attention layers. While both paradigms have shown promise, existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve high identity fidelity and flexible text controllability. We introduce UniID, a unified tuning-free framework that synergistically integrates both paradigms. Our key insight is that when merging these approaches, they should mutually reinforce only identity-relevant information while preserving the original diffusion prior for non-identity attributes. We realize this through a principled training-inference strategy: during training, we employ an identity-focused learning scheme that guides both branches to capture identity features exclusively; at inference, we introduce a normalized rescaling mechanism that recovers the text controllability of the base diffusion model while enabling complementary identity signals to enhance each other. This principled design enables UniID to achieve high-fidelity face personalization with flexible text controllability. Extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that UniID achieves superior performance in both identity preservation and text controllability.

The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling a robot to navigate to a target position following a natural language instruction. Unlike human binocular vision, most agricultural robots are only given a single camera for monocular vision, which results in limited spatial perception. To bridge this gap, we present the method of Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation with Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE-AgriVLN), in which we propose the MDE module generating depth features from RGB images, to assist the decision-maker on reasoning. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our MDE-AgriVLN method successfully increases Success Rate from 0.23 to 0.32 and decreases Navigation Error from 4.43m to 4.08m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural VLN domain.

We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $λ$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $θ$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology."

While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization."

    "abstract": "Recent stateful recurrent neural networks have achieved remarkable progress on static 3D reconstruction but remain vulnerable to motion-induced artifacts, where non-rigid regions corrupt attention propagation between the spatial memory and image feature. By analyzing the internal behaviors of the state and image token updating mechanism, we find that aggregating self-attention maps across layers reveals a consistent pattern: dynamic regions are naturally down-weighted, exposing an implicit motion cue that the pretrained transformer already encodes but never explicitly uses. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MUT3R, a training-free framework that applies the attention-derived motion cue to suppress dynamic content in the early layers of the transformer during inference. Our attention-level gating module suppresses the influence of dynamic regions before their artifacts propagate through the feature hierarchy. Notably, we do not retrain or fine-tune the model; we let the pretrained transformer diagnose its own motion cues and correct itself. This early regulation stabilizes geometric reasoning in streaming scenarios and leads to improvements in temporal consistency and camera pose robustness across multiple dynamic benchmarks, offering a simple and training-free pathway toward motion-aware streaming reconstruction."

    "abstract": "The theoretical description of broadband, multimode quantum pulses undergoing a second-order $χ^{(2)}$-nonlinear interaction can be quite intricate, due to the large dimensionality of the underlying phase space. However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales."

However, these tools face a fundamental tension between automation and performance when dealing with quantifier instantiation -- the primary source of incompleteness and verification slowdown in SMT-based verifiers. Tools choose between aggressive quantifier instantiation that provides more automation but longer verification times, or conservative instantiation that responds quickly but may require more manual proof hints. We present a mechanism that enables fine-grained control over the availability of quantified facts in verification contexts, allowing developers to selectively tune the level of automation. Our approach lets library authors provide different pre-defined automation levels while giving end-users the ability to further customize quantifier availability at the module, function, or proof context level. We implement our techniques in Verus, a Rust-based verification tool, and evaluate them on multiple openly available codebases. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the automation-performance tradeoff and that selective quantifier management enables developers to select the appropriate level of automation in different contexts."

We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology."

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of large-scale brain models remains a central challenge due to the inherent complexity of these systems. In this work, we explore the emergence of complex spatiotemporal patterns in a large scale-brain model composed of 90 interconnected brain regions coupled through empirically derived anatomical connectivity. An important aspect of our formulation is that the local dynamics of each brain region are described by a next-generation neural mass model, which explicitly captures the macroscopic gamma activity of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neural populations (PING mechanism). We first identify the system's homogeneous states-both resting and oscillatory-and analyze their stability under uniform perturbations. Then, we determine the stability against non-uniform perturbations by obtaining dispersion relations for the perturbation growth rate. This analysis enables us to link unstable directions of the homogeneous solutions to the emergence of rich spatiotemporal patterns, that we characterize by means of Lyapunov exponents and frequency spectrum analysis. Our results show that, compared to previous studies with classical neural mass models, next-generation neural mass models provide a broader dynamical repertoire, both within homogeneous states and in the heterogeneous regime. Additionally, we identify a key role for anatomical connectivity in cross-frequency coupling, allowing for the emergence of gamma oscillations with amplitude modulated by slower rhythms. These findings suggest that such models are not only more biophysically grounded but also particularly well-suited to capture the full complexity of large-scale brain dynamics. Overall, our study advances the analytical understanding of emerging spatiotemporal patterns in whole-brain models."

Chemistry of the carbonate system is well understood in bulk solution, however processes such as mineral weathering and biomineralisation frequently occur in nano-confined spaces where carbonate chemistry is less explored. For confined systems, the speciation equilibria are expected to tilt due to surface reactivity, electric fields and reduced configurational entropy. In this discussion paper we provide measurements of interaction force between negatively charged aluminosilicate (mica) sheets across aqueous carbonate/bicarbonate solutions confined to nanoscale films in equilibrium with a reservoir of the solution. By fitting the measurements to a Poisson-Boltzmann equation modified to account for charge regulation at the bounding walls, we discuss features of the bicarbonate speciation in confinement. We find that (i) the presence of bicarbonate in the bulk reservoir causes a repulsive excess pressure in the slit compared to pH-neutral salt solutions at the same concentration, arising from a higher (negative) effective charge on the mica surfaces; (ii) the electrostatic screening length is lower for solutions of Na2CO3 compared to NaHCO3 at the same bulk concentration, due to a shift in the speciation equilibria with pH and in accordance with Debye-Hückel theory; (iii) hydration forces are observed at distances below 2 nm with features of size 0.1 nm and 0.3 nm; this was reproducible across the various bicarbonate electrolytes studied, and contrasts with hydration forces of uniform step size measured in pH-neutral electrolytes."

As a background, we have the information provided by the texts of early Christian writers, which imposed that churches should be oriented towards the east [..]. The fieldwork that supports our comparative study is based on the measurement of the precise location coordinates, axis' azimuth and angular height of the horizon for most of the churches of the three islands, which amounts to about 120 sets of measurements. For the study of the sample, we have employed various analyses, both statistical, as well as calendric and orographic. Our results show that on all the islands, the pattern of double orientations is repeated, which contemplates the canonical tradition of orienting the altars of churches within the solar range (pointing either eastward or westward). Very few cases also occur where it is possible to identify constructions whose orientation follows solstitial patterns, perhaps as imitation of aboriginal worship. But this double pattern also includes a high proportion of churches with orientations far from this range. An example is Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, both islands subjected to the same flow of the prevailing trade winds in the region, but each with its own characteristics. Another example is given by the particular orography of deep ravines of La Gomera, which determines the orientation of the temples located in those geographical accidents. In this paper we show how the combination of elements of the land- and skyscape can, with a high degree of probability, offer a satisfactory explanation to the particular orientation of these insular centres of worship, which were built during the first decades after the European conquest."

The diagram is constructed from a characterization package applied to bulk ceramics including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales, local coordination environments, and electronic structures across the formulation space. This comprehensive measurement suite is critical to identify boundaries between the closely related phases. For example, Raman scattering reveals local structural and defect environments unique to bixbyite local order that persist to ~50% Ce under equilibrium synthesis conditions but are invisible to XRD and TEM. We also report a companion thin film study to demonstrate that quenched kinetic energy from a physical deposition process can metastabilize the high symmetry, and thus high entropy, fluorite phase with only 20% Ce. This is noteworthy because electroneutrality constraints demand an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice; we estimate 16.7%, approaching that of delta-Bi2O3. Together, our equilibrium ceramics and far-from-equilibrium thin films show that when synthesis is coupled with rigorously chosen, multi-length-scale characterization, now one can identify the phase stability thermodynamic drivers and simultaneously derive practical guidelines for experimentally realizing targeted phases and structures - and thereby deliberately engineer properties in CeO2-LA2O3 HEOs, whose broad defect chemistries demand such an approach."

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising direction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as strong biological plausibility and low energy consumption on neuromorphic hardware. Despite these benefits, SNNs still face challenges in achieving state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. Recent work has shown that hybrid rate-temporal coding strategies (particularly those incorporating bit-plane representations of images into traditional rate coding schemes) can significantly improve performance when trained with surrogate backpropagation. Motivated by these findings, this study proposes a hybrid temporal-bit spike coding method that integrates bit-plane decompositions with temporal coding principles. Through extensive experiments across multiple computer vision benchmarks, we demonstrate that blending bit-plane information with temporal coding yields competitive, and in some cases improved, performance compared to established spike-coding techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a hybrid temporal-bit coding scheme specifically designed for surrogate gradient training of SNNs."

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons play a crucial role in assisting patients with varying mobility levels during rehabilitation. However, existing control strategies face challenges such as imprecise trajectory tracking, interaction torque oscillations, and limited adaptability to diverse patient conditions. To address these issues, this paper proposes an assist-as-needed (AAN) control algorithm that integrates a human-robot coupling dynamics model, a human torque-momentum observer (HTMO), and an adaptive parameter controller (APC). The algorithm first employs inverse dynamics to compute the joint torques required for the rehabilitation trajectory. The HTMO then estimates the torque exerted by the patient's joints and determines the torque error, which the exoskeleton compensates for via a spring-damper system, ultimately generating the target trajectory. Finally, the APC ensures adaptive assistive control. The proposed method is validated for its effectiveness in MATLAB/Simulink."

Contacts were defined by spatial thresholds (1.5 m and 3 m) and cumulative duration, enabling the generation of detailed contact matrices. Simulation results showed that low and medium care residents experienced the highest frequency of interactions, particularly with staff on morning and afternoon shifts, while high care residents and night staff had substantially fewer contacts. Contact rates varied significantly by care level and shift, confirmed through Poisson-based regression modelling. Temporal analyses revealed clustering of high-risk contacts during structured daily routines, especially communal and care activities. An integrated airborne transmission module, seeded with a single infectious staff member, demonstrated that infection risk was highest during high-contact shifts and among medium care residents. Vaccination scenarios reduced predicted transmission by up to 68\\%, with the greatest impact observed when both staff and residents were vaccinated. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for contact heterogeneity in aged care and demonstrate the utility of ABMs for evaluating targeted infection control strategies in high-risk, enclosed environments."

We find that while pre-training and fine-tuning always help our model but have diminishing returns, intermediate fine-tuning can actually show harmful impact on downstream performance, potentially due to dissimilarity in task mechanics. Taken together, our results suggest that small-scale ViTs benefit most from targeted pre-training and careful data selection, while indiscriminate stacking of intermediate tasks can waste compute and even degrade performance."

We introduce PULSE, a multi-task vision-language framework built on self-supervised representations and optimized through a composite supervision strategy that balances region overlap learning, pixel wise classification fidelity, and boundary aware IoU refinement. A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture. Unlike prior task-specific pipelines, PULSE learns task-invariant cardiac priors, generalizes robustly across datasets, and can be adapted to new imaging modalities with minimal supervision. This moves the field closer to a scalable, foundation style cardiac analysis framework."

By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario."

    "abstract": "Prevailing Dataset Distillation (DD) methods leveraging generative models confront two fundamental limitations. First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets. Notably, it establishes a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.4% at the 50-images-per-class (IPC) setup on ImageNet-1K. Our code is available on the project webpage: https://github.com/zzzlt422/CoDA"

By employing an effort-based description of bilateral relationships between entities, we provide an accurate breakdown of relationship patterns, simplifying them to focus placement and four key states. This framework captures mutual relationships, group behaviors, and actions conforming to social norms, translating them into specific directives for autonomous systems. By integrating both subjective perceptions and objective states, the model precisely identifies and describes miscommunication. The primary objective of this paper is to automate the analysis, modeling, and description of social behavior, and to determine how autonomous systems can behave in accordance with social norms for full social integration while simultaneously pursuing their own social goals."

The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior."

Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Then, it was applied to a real-life optimization problem, namely the shape optimization of a single-phase ejector. Compared with a non-accelerated methodology, ours was able to save weeks of CPU time in solving this problem. To experimentally confirm the performance of the optimized ejector shapes, four of them were 3D printed and tested on the lab scale confirming the predicted performance. This suggests that our methodology could be used for acceleration of other real-life shape optimization problems."

The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $γ$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member.

These schemes enable the concurrent authentication of several users while eliminating the need for a certification authority. Numerous GAS methods have been explored in the literature, and they can be classified into three distinct generations based on their foundational mathematical principles. First-generation GASs rely on polynomial interpolation and the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Second-generation GASs also employ polynomial interpolation, but they distinguish themselves by incorporating elliptic curves over finite fields. While third-generation GASs present a promising solution for scalable environments, they demonstrate a limitation in certain applications. Such applications typically require the identification of users participating in the authentication process. In the third-generation GAS, users are able to verify their credentials while maintaining anonymity. However, there are various applications where the identification of participating users is necessary. In this study, we propose an improved version of third-generation GAS, utilizing inner product spaces and polynomial interpolation to resolve this limitation. We address the issue of preventing malicious actions by legitimate group members. The current third-generation scheme allows members to share group credentials, which can jeopardize group confidentiality. Our proposed scheme mitigates this risk by eliminating the ability of individual users to distribute credentials.

Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget."

The primary objective is to characterize the Fe-K absorption features due to Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO) in this Eddington-luminosity source. Observations were conducted with XRISM's Resolve and Xtend instruments, complemented by simultaneous data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. A historically bright phase was captured. The Resolve spectra clearly reveal a prominent P Cygni profile and resolves the Fe-K absorption into six distinct velocity components, ranging from $v = -0.074c$ to $-0.405c$. A similar superposition of multiple UFOs has been reported in PDS~456, suggesting that such a ``UFO forest'' structure may be a common feature of near Eddington-luminosity sources. Some UFO components exhibit narrow line widths of approximately $σ\\sim 200\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, which may indicate that the outflows have reached their terminal velocities, thereby resulting in a smaller velocity shear. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{out} \\sim 1~M_{\\odot}~\\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is of the order of the Eddington accretion rate. This suggests a physically plausible scenario where the outflow is a significant channel for mass ejection."

    "abstract": "Generalizing open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation (OV-3DIS) to diverse, unstructured, and mesh-free environments is crucial for robotics and AR/VR, yet remains a significant challenge. We attribute this to two key limitations of existing methods: (1) proposal generation relies on dataset-specific proposal networks or mesh-based superpoints, rendering them inapplicable in mesh-free scenarios and limiting generalization to novel scenes; and (2) the weak textual reasoning of CLIP-based classifiers, which struggle to recognize compositional and functional user queries. To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online. Given an RGB-D stream, our pipeline first leverages a 2D open-vocabulary segmenter to generate masks, which are lifted to 3D point clouds using depth. Mask-guided instance features are then extracted using DINO feature maps, and our tracker fuses visual and spatial cues to maintain instance consistency. The core pipeline is entirely mesh-free, yet we also provide an optional superpoints refinement module to further enhance performance when scene mesh is available. Finally, we replace CLIP with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM), significantly enhancing compositional reasoning for complex user queries. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including ScanNet200, Replica, ScanNet++, and SceneFun3D, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization capabilities."

The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives."

We propose an adaptive sparse sensing framework that couples a variational autoencoder prior with reinforcement learning to select measurements sequentially. Experiments show that this approach outperforms CS, OSP, and Generative model-based reconstruction from sparse measurements."

Given time-varying text prompts, FloodDiffusion generates text-aligned, seamless motion sequences with real-time latency. Unlike existing methods that rely on chunk-by-chunk or auto-regressive model with diffusion head, we adopt a diffusion forcing framework to model this time-series generation task under time-varying control events. We find that a straightforward implementation of vanilla diffusion forcing (as proposed for video models) fails to model real motion distributions. We demonstrate that to guarantee modeling the output distribution, the vanilla diffusion forcing must be tailored to: (i) train with a bi-directional attention instead of casual attention; (ii) implement a lower triangular time scheduler instead of a random one; (iii) utilize a continues time-varying way to introduce text conditioning. With these improvements, we demonstrate in the first time that the diffusion forcing-based framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the streaming motion generation task, reaching an FID of 0.057 on the HumanML3D benchmark.

    "abstract": "Developing high-stakes autonomous systems that include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components is complex; the consequences of errors can be catastrophic, yet it is challenging to plan for all operational cases. In stressful scenarios for the human operator, such as short decision-making timescales, the risk of failures is exacerbated. A lack of understanding of AI failure modes obstructs this and so blocks the robust implementation of applications of AI in smart systems. This prevents early risk identification, leading to increased time, risk and cost of projects. A key tenet of Systems Engineering and acquisition engineering is centred around a \"left-shift\" in test and evaluation activities to earlier in the system lifecycle, to allow for \"accelerated delivery of [systems] that work\". We argue it is therefore essential that this shift includes the analysis of AI failure cases as part of the design stages of the system life cycle. Our proposed framework enables the early characterisation of risks emerging from human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in operational contexts. The cornerstone of this is a new analysis of AI failure modes, built on the seminal modelling of human-autonomy teams laid out by LaMonica et al., 2022. Using the analysis of the interactions between human and autonomous systems and exploring the failure modes within each aspect, our approach provides a way to systematically identify human-AI interactions risks across the operational domain of the system of interest. The understanding of the emergent behaviour enables increased robustness of the system, for which the analysis should be undertaken over the whole scope of its operational design domain. This approach is illustrated through an example use case for an AI assistant supporting a Command & Control (C2) System."

However, they overlook the semantic misalignment between visual and textual contexts, which arises due to the rigidity of a fixed context prompt learned on a single source domain. To this end, we present a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation, namely Domain-aware Prompt-driven Masked Transformer (DPMFormer). Firstly, we introduce domain-aware prompt learning to facilitate semantic alignment between visual and textual cues. To capture various domain-specific properties with a single source dataset, we propose domain-aware contrastive learning along with the texture perturbation that diversifies the observable domains. Lastly, to establish a framework resilient against diverse environmental changes, we have proposed the domain-robust consistency learning which guides the model to minimize discrepancies of prediction from original and the augmented images. Through experiments and analyses, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which establishes a new state-of-the-art on various DGSS benchmarks.

Foundational computer science courses often present algorithmic thinking as purely formal and ahistorical, emphasizing efficiency, correctness, and abstraction. When history is mentioned, it usually centers on the modern development of digital computers, highlighting figures such as Turing, von Neumann, and Babbage. This narrow view misrepresents the origins of algorithmic reasoning and perpetuates a Eurocentric worldview that undermines equity and representation in STEM. In contrast, algorithmic thinking predates electronic computers by millennia and has deep roots in ancient civilizations including India, China, Babylon, and Egypt. Our work responds to this gap by embedding algorithm instruction in broader historical and cultural contexts, with particular attention to classical Indian contributions."

    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have emerged as a promising technology due to their ability to dynamically reconfigure wireless propagation environments. A novel PASS-based multi-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework is proposed by exploiting the waveguide-division (WD) transmission characteristic. Specifically, each NOMA user cluster is served by one dedicated waveguide, and the corresponding pinching beamforming is exploited to enhance the intra-cluster performance while mitigating the inter-cluster interference. Based on this framework, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing power allocation, pinching beamforming, and user scheduling. To solve this problem, a two-step algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems. For the joint power allocation and pinching beamforming design, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm is proposed to obtain the locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the coupling constraints are alleviated through augmented Lagrangian relaxation, and the resulting augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem is decomposed into four subproblems, which are solved by the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. For the user scheduling, a low-complexity matching algorithm is developed to solve the user-to-waveguide assignment problem. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) the proposed PASS-based NOMA framework under the WD transmission structure achieves significant sum-rate gain over conventional fixed-position antenna systems and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme; and 2) the proposed matching-based user scheduling algorithm achieves near-optimal user-waveguide association with low computational complexity."

We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop\" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude.

BPM plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and regulatory compliance of biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes. However, the development of accurate soft sensors for BPM is hindered by key challenges, including limited historical data, infrequent feedback, heterogeneous process conditions, and high-dimensional sensory inputs. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of machine learning (ML) methods designed to address these challenges, with a focus on learning from historical data with limited volume and relevance in the context of bioprocess monitoring. We evaluate multiple ML approaches including feature dimensionality reduction, online learning, and just-in-time learning across three datasets, one in silico dataset and two real-world experimental datasets. Our findings highlight the importance of training strategies in handling limited data and feedback, with batch learning proving effective in homogeneous settings, while just-in-time learning and online learning demonstrate superior adaptability in cold-start scenarios. Additionally, we identify key meta-features, such as feed media composition and process control strategies, that significantly impact model transferability. The results also suggest that integrating Raman-based predictions with lagged offline measurements enhances monitoring accuracy, offering a promising direction for future bioprocess soft sensor development."

Conventional policy networks struggle to process full-resolution LIDAR inputs, forcing prior works to rely on simplified observations that reduce spatial awareness and navigation robustness. This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework built on top of the DreamerV3 algorithm, integrating a Multi-Layer Perceptron Variational Autoencoder (MLP-VAE) within a world model to encode high-dimensional LIDAR readings into compact latent representations. These latent features, combined with a learned dynamics predictor, enable efficient imagination-based policy optimization. Experiments on simulated TurtleBot3 navigation tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves faster convergence and higher success rate compared to model-free baselines such as SAC, DDPG, and TD3. It is worth emphasizing that the DreamerV3-based agent attains a 100% success rate across all evaluated environments when using the full dataset of the Turtlebot3 LIDAR (360 readings), while model-free methods plateaued below 85%. These findings demonstrate that integrating predictive world models with learned latent representations enables more efficient and robust navigation from high-dimensional sensory data."

Existing autoscaling policies, often retrofitted from monolithic systems like those in AIBrix and DistServe, rely on lagging indicators such as GPU utilization or coarse-grained request counts. This results in slow reactions to load spikes, leading to significant Time-to First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) SLO violations and costly over-provisioning. We introduce TokenScale, an autoscaling framework that resolves this performance mismatch through two innovations. First, we propose Token Velocity, a novel metric that unifies the prefill, network, and decode stages by quantifying their rate of work. As a leading indicator of system backpressure, it enables proactive scaling. Second, Convertible Decoders allow decoder GPUs to dynamically execute prefill tasks during traffic spikes, creating a rapid-response buffer that absorbs bursts and eliminates the initialization latency of new prefillers. Our evaluation on a GPU cluster with production traces shows TokenScale improves SLO attainment from 50-88% to 80-96% and reduces costs by 4-14% over state-of-the-art systems, including DistServe, BlitzScale, and AIBrix. By uniting a predictive metric with a flexible system design, TokenScale significantly boosts the performance and efficiency of disaggregated LLM serving infrastructure."

Drawing on the Health Belief Model (HBM), this study examined belief-based predictors of intention to use GAI and therapists across two populations: a university sample (N = 1,155) and a nationally representative adult sample (N = 651). Using repeated-measures ANOVA and LASSO regression, we found that therapists were consistently valued for emotional, relational, and personalization benefits, while GAI was favored for accessibility and affordability. Yet structural advantages alone did not predict adoption; emotional benefit and personalization emerged as decisive factors. Adoption patterns diverged across groups: students treated GAI as a complement, whereas national adults approached it as a substitute. Concerns about privacy and reliability constrained GAI use in both groups. These findings extend HBM to multi-modality contexts and highlight design implications for trustworthy, emotionally resonant digital mental health tools."

    "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most popular methods among parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to adapt pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. However, the model trained based on LoRA often has an unsatisfactory performance due to its low-rank assumption. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Dual LoRA to improve the performance by incorporating an inductive bias into the original LoRA. Specifically, we separate low-rank matrices into two groups: the magnitude group to control whether or not and how far we should update a parameter and the direction group to decide whether this parameter should move forward or backward, to better simulate the parameter updating process of the full fine-tuning based on gradient-based optimization algorithms. We show that this can be simply achieved by adding a ReLU function to the magnitude group and a sign function to the direction group. We conduct several experiments over a wide range of NLP tasks, including natural language generation (NLG), understanding (NLU), and commonsense reasoning datasets on GPT-2, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and LLaMA-1/2/3 as baseline models. The results show that we consistently outperform LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants with the same number of trainable parameters."

    "abstract": "Organizations struggle to share data across departments that have adopted different data analytics platforms. If n datasets must serve m environments, up to n*m replicas can emerge, increasing inconsistency and cost. Traditional warehouses copy data into vendor-specific stores; cross-platform access is hard. This study proposes the Enterprise Data Science Platform (EDSP), which builds on data lakehouse architecture and follows a Write-Once, Read-Anywhere principle. EDSP enables federated data access for multi-query engine environments, targeting data science workloads with periodic data updates and query response times ranging from seconds to minutes. By providing centralized data management with federated access from multiple query engines to the same data sources, EDSP eliminates data duplication and vendor lock-in inherent in traditional data warehouses. The platform employs a four-layer architecture: Data Preparation, Data Store, Access Interface, and Query Engines. This design enforces separation of concerns and reduces the need for data migration when integrating additional analytical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that major cloud data warehouses and programming environments can directly query EDSP-managed datasets. We implemented and deployed EDSP in production, confirming interoperability across multiple query engines. For data sharing across different analytical environments, EDSP achieves a 33-44% reduction in operational steps compared with conventional approaches requiring data migration. Although query latency may increase by up to a factor of 2.6 compared with native tables, end-to-end completion times remain on the order of seconds, maintaining practical performance for analytical use cases. Based on our production experience, EDSP provides practical design guidelines for addressing the data-silo problem in multi-query engine environments."

A giga-gauss magnetic field is generated and amplified with the opposite polarity to the seed magnetic field. The spot size of the field is comparable to the laser wavelength, and the lifetime is hundreds of femtoseconds. An analytical model is presented to explain the underlying physics.

In this paper, we consider an integrated sensing, communication, and computation-enabled edge perception network, where multiple edge devices utilize wireless signals to sense environmental information for updating their local models, and the edge server aggregates feature embeddings via over-the-air computation for global model training.

    "abstract": "Restriction categories provide a categorical framework for partiality. In this paper, we introduce three new categorical theories for partiality: local categories, partial categories, and inclusion categories. The objects of a local category are partially accessible resources, and morphisms are processes between these resources. In a partial category, partiality is addressed via two operators, restriction and contraction, which control the domain of definition of a morphism. Finally, an inclusion category is a category equipped with a family of monics which axiomatize the inclusions between sets. The main result of this paper shows that restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to local categories, that partial categories are $2$-equivalent to inclusion categories, and that both restriction/local categories are $2$-equivalent to bounded partial/inclusion categories. Our result offers four equivalent ways to describe partiality: on morphisms, via restriction categories; on objects, with local categories; operationally, with partial categories; and via inclusions, with inclusion categories. We also translate several key concepts from restriction category theory to the local category context, which allows us to show that various special kinds of restriction categories, such as inverse categories, are $2$-equivalent to their analogous kind of local categories. In particular, the equivalence between inverse (restriction) categories and inverse local categories is a generalization of the celebrated Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad theorem for inverse semigroups."

However, existing research predominantly focuses on coarse spatiotemporal scales and relies on low-resolution satellite data, capturing only macroscopic fire states while fundamentally constraining high-precision localized fire dynamics modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we present FireSentry, a provincial-scale multi-modal wildfire dataset characterized by sub-meter spatial and sub-second temporal resolution. Collected using synchronized UAV platforms, FireSentry provides visible and infrared video streams, in-situ environmental measurements, and manually validated fire masks. Building on FireSentry, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing physics-based, data-driven, and generative models, revealing the limitations of existing mask-only approaches. Our analysis proposes FiReDiff, a novel dual-modality paradigm that first predicts future video sequences in the infrared modality, and then precisely segments fire masks in the mask modality based on the generated dynamics. FiReDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, with video quality gains of 39.2% in PSNR, 36.1% in SSIM, 50.0% in LPIPS, 29.4% in FVD, and mask accuracy gains of 3.3% in AUPRC, 59.1% in F1 score, 42.9% in IoU, and 62.5% in MSE when applied to generative models.

    "abstract": "Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a very deadly disease worldwide, and its early diagnosis is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. Computed tomography (CT) scans are widely used for lung cancer diagnosis as they can give detailed lung structures. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to human error. To surmount this challenge, the study proposes a deep learning-based automatic lung cancer classification system to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. The IQOTHNCCD lung cancer dataset is utilized, which is a public CT scan dataset consisting of cases categorized into Normal, Benign, and Malignant and used DenseNet169, which includes Squeezeand-Excitation blocks for attention-based feature extraction, Focal Loss for handling class imbalance, and a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for multi-scale feature fusion. In addition, an SVM model was developed using MobileNetV2 for feature extraction, improving its classification performance. For model interpretability enhancement, the study integrated Grad-CAM for the visualization of decision-making regions in CT scans and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for explanation of feature contributions within the SVM model. Intensive evaluation was performed, and it was found that both DenseNet169 and SVM models achieved 98% accuracy, suggesting their robustness for real-world medical practice. These results open up the potential for deep learning to improve the diagnosis of lung cancer by a higher level of accuracy, transparency, and robustness."

Here we discovered a zero-field magnetization switching effect in an exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted magnetic hysteresis. This zero-field magnetic reversal was further evidenced by its inverted large anomalous Hall effect. Notably, this collective spin flipping at zero field can occur at room temperature or above room temperature, which may be associated with quantum interference effect due to thermal fluctuation enhanced disorder. Our experimental results offer a way to design room-temperature exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnets with zero-field multi magnetic-states and large anomalous Hall effect, holding potential for low-power and high-density memory applications."

However, its effectiveness is often limited by insufficient trajectory precision due to compounding errors. In this paper, we introduce Grasped Object Manifold Projection (GOMP), an interactive method that mitigates these errors by constraining a non-rigidly grasped object to a lower-dimensional manifold. GOMP assumes a precise task in which a manipulator holds an object that may shift within the grasp in an observable manner and must be mated with a grounded part. Crucially, all GOMP enhancements are learned from the same expert dataset used to train the base IL policy, and are adjusted with an n-arm bandit-based interactive component. We propose a theoretical basis for GOMP's improvement upon the well-known compounding error bound in IL literature. We demonstrate the framework on four precise assembly tasks using tactile feedback, and note that the approach remains modality-agnostic.

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration."

    "abstract": "Ejection fraction (EF) is a crucial metric for assessing cardiac function and diagnosing conditions such as heart failure. Traditionally, EF estimation requires manual tracing and domain expertise, making the process time-consuming and subject to interobserver variability. Most current deep learning methods for EF prediction are black-box models with limited transparency, which reduces clinical trust. Some post-hoc explainability methods have been proposed to interpret the decision-making process after the prediction is made. However, these explanations do not guide the model's internal reasoning and therefore offer limited reliability in clinical applications. To address this, we introduce ProtoEFNet, a novel video-based prototype learning model for continuous EF regression. The model learns dynamic spatiotemporal prototypes that capture clinically meaningful cardiac motion patterns. Additionally, the proposed Prototype Angular Separation (PAS) loss enforces discriminative representations across the continuous EF spectrum. Our experiments on the EchonetDynamic dataset show that ProtoEFNet can achieve accuracy on par with its non-interpretable counterpart while providing clinically relevant insight. The ablation study shows that the proposed loss boosts performance with a 2% increase in F1 score from 77.67$\\pm$2.68 to 79.64$\\pm$2.10.

The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation."

The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several. Published VLA and Swift/XRT non-detections show no radio or X-ray afterglow, placing strong limits on relativistic ejecta and dense circumstellar material. Given its high specific kinetic energy, the absence of early excess emission and the radio/X-ray non-detections imply that any jet was either far off-axis or choked; otherwise, SN 2020lao represents an extreme non-relativistic SN Ic-BL."

The SCHMM captures the stochastic network behavior in real time, while LMPC ensures consensus and optimality via Linear Matrix Inequalities LMIs. The developed optimal control problem simultaneously minimizes three elements. First, the control effort is reduced to avoid aggressive inputs and second, the network induced error caused by time delays and packet dropouts. Third, the topology-induced error, as the distributed graph restricts agents access to global information. This error is inherent to the communication graph and cannot be addressed through offline learning. To overcome this, the study also introduces the incremental Expectation Maximization EM algorithm, enabling online learning of the SCHMM. This adaptation allows the framework to mitigate both network and topology errors while maintaining optimality through MPC. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHMM LMPC, demonstrating adaptability in multi agent systems with diverse topologies."

This decouples instructional content from private data, preserving teaching efficacy. Tests on MathDial show SRPG works across models; with GPT-4o, it achieves 0.0000 Attack Success Rate (ASR) (zero leakage) and 0.8267 Exact Match, far outperforming the zero trust Pure LLM baseline (0.2138).

    "abstract": "Active visual perception refers to the ability of a system to dynamically engage with its environment through sensing and action, allowing it to modify its behavior in response to specific goals or uncertainties. Unlike passive systems that rely solely on visual data, active visual perception systems can direct attention, move sensors, or interact with objects to acquire more informative data. This approach is particularly powerful in complex environments where static sensing methods may not provide sufficient information. Active visual perception plays a critical role in numerous applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and surveillance systems. However, despite its significant promise, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including real-time processing of complex visual data, decision-making in dynamic environments, and integrating multimodal sensory inputs. This paper explores both the opportunities and challenges inherent in active visual perception, providing a comprehensive overview of its potential, current research, and the obstacles that must be overcome for broader adoption."

    "abstract": "3D stylization is central to game development, virtual reality, and digital arts, where the demand for diverse assets calls for scalable methods that support fast, high-fidelity manipulation. Existing text-to-3D stylization methods typically distill from 2D image editors, requiring time-intensive per-asset optimization and exhibiting multi-view inconsistency due to the limitations of current text-to-image models, which makes them impractical for large-scale production. In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations. Comprehensive evaluations show that GaussianBlender not only delivers instant, high-fidelity, geometry-preserving, multi-view consistent stylization, but also surpasses methods that require per-instance test-time optimization - unlocking practical, democratized 3D stylization at scale."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can reliably distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences, but how grammatical knowledge is represented within the models remains an open question. We investigate whether different syntactic phenomena recruit shared or distinct components in LLMs. Using a functional localization approach inspired by cognitive neuroscience, we identify the LLM units most responsive to 67 English syntactic phenomena in seven open-weight models. These units are consistently recruited across sentences containing the phenomena and causally support the models' syntactic performance. Critically, different types of syntactic agreement (e.g., subject-verb, anaphor, determiner-noun) recruit overlapping sets of units, suggesting that agreement constitutes a meaningful functional category for LLMs. This pattern holds in English, Russian, and Chinese; and further, in a cross-lingual analysis of 57 diverse languages, structurally more similar languages share more units for subject-verb agreement. Taken together, these findings reveal that syntactic agreement-a critical marker of syntactic dependencies-constitutes a meaningful category within LLMs' representational spaces."

We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH."

    "abstract": "The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*>Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a<0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling."

Such spin currents, however, are symmetry forbidden in conventional collinear antiferromagnets and higher-order altermagnets. Using spin point group analysis, we demonstrate that finite spin currents can be induced in these materials via magnetoelectric, piezomagnetic, and piezomagnetoelectric-like couplings. We utilize electric fields, strain, and their combinations to drive symmetry-lowering phase transitions into uncompensated magnetic or d-wave altermagnetic states, thereby enabling finite spin conductivity in a broader class of magnetic materials. We further substantiate this framework using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport calculations on representative magnetic materials - KV2Se2O, RuF4 , Cr2O3 , FeS2 , and MnPSe3 - spanning these different cases. The charge-to-spin conversion ratio reaches up to almost 100% via uncompensated magnetism and about 40% via d-wave altermagnetism under realistic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for efficient spin current generation."

Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$.

Given the computational costs associated with estimating $E_m$ using conventional density functional theory (DFT) based nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, we benchmark the accuracy in $E_m$ and geometry predictions of five foundational machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which can potentially accelerate predictions of ionic transport. Specifically, we assess the accuracy of MACE-MP-0, Orb-v3, SevenNet, CHGNet, and M3GNet models, coupled with the NEB framework, against DFT-NEB-calculated $E_m$ across a diverse set of battery-relevant chemistries and structures. Notably, MACE-MP-0 and Orb-v3 exhibit the lowest mean absolute errors in $E_m$ predictions across the entire dataset and over data points that are not outliers, respectively. Importantly, Orb-v3 and SevenNet classify `good' versus `bad' ionic conductors with an accuracy of $>$82\\%, based on a threshold $E_m$ of 500~meV, indicating their utility in high-throughput screening approaches. Notably, intermediate images generated by MACE-MP-0 and SevenNet provide better initial guesses relative to conventional interpolation techniques in $>$71\\% of structures, offering a practical route to accelerate subsequent DFT-NEB relaxations. Finally, we observe that accurate $E_m$ predictions by MLIPs are not correlated with accurate (local) geometry predictions. Our work establishes the use-cases, accuracies, and limitations of foundational MLIPs in estimating $E_m$ and should serve as a base for accelerating the discovery of novel ionic conductors for batteries and beyond."

This lowers the effective Nyquist frequency and introduces aliasing, while naïve low-pass filtering removes task-relevant high-frequency cues. In this study, we present Aliasing-aware Patch Embedding (AaPE), a drop-in patch stem that mitigates aliasing while preserving high-frequency information. AaPE augments standard patch tokens with features produced by a band-limited complex sinusoidal kernel using a two-sided exponential window that dynamically targets alias-prone bands. Frequency and decay parameters of the kernel are estimated from the input, enabling parallel, adaptive subband analysis whose outputs are fused with the standard patch tokens. AaPE integrates seamlessly into the masked teacher-student self-supervised learning. In addition, we combine a multi-mask strategy with a contrastive objective to enforce consistency across diverse mask patterns, stabilizing training. Pre-training on AudioSet followed by fine-tuning evaluation across diverse downstream benchmarks, which spanned categories, such as environmental sounds and other common audio domains. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on a subset of tasks and competitive results across the remainder. Complementary linear probing evaluation mirrors this pattern, yielding clear gains on several benchmarks and strong performance elsewhere. The collective analysis of these results indicates that AaPE serves to mitigate the effects of aliasing without discarding of informative high-frequency content."

RRT* algorithm is used for planning trajectories and screw theory based forward kinematic equations are solved for determining joint solutions of the manipulator and gripper.

We introduce MemVerse, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play memory framework that bridges fast parametric recall with hierarchical retrieval-based memory, enabling scalable and adaptive multimodal intelligence. MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemVerse significantly improves multimodal reasoning and continual learning efficiency, empowering agents to remember, adapt, and reason coherently across extended interactions."

Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry.

We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations."

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, these models often lack 3D consistency, a fundamental requirement for understanding scene geometry and motion, thereby causing severe spatial misalignment and temporal flickering in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present Motion4D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating 2D priors from foundation models into a unified 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. Our method features a two-part iterative optimization framework: 1) Sequential optimization, which updates motion and semantic fields in consecutive stages to maintain local consistency, and 2) Global optimization, which jointly refines all attributes for long-term coherence. To enhance motion accuracy, we introduce a 3D confidence map that dynamically adjusts the motion priors, and an adaptive resampling process that inserts new Gaussians into under-represented regions based on per-pixel RGB and semantic errors. Furthermore, we enhance semantic coherence through an iterative refinement process that resolves semantic inconsistencies by alternately optimizing the semantic fields and updating prompts of SAM2. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our Motion4D significantly outperforms both 2D foundation models and existing 3D-based approaches across diverse scene understanding tasks, including point-based tracking, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis.

    "abstract": "We present a CloseUpAvatar - a novel approach for articulated human avatar representation dealing with more general camera motions, while preserving rendering quality for close-up views. CloseUpAvatar represents an avatar as a set of textured planes with two sets of learnable textures for low and high-frequency detail. The method automatically switches to high-frequency textures only for cameras positioned close to the avatar's surface and gradually reduces their impact as the camera moves farther away. Such parametrization of the avatar enables CloseUpAvatar to adjust rendering quality based on camera distance ensuring realistic rendering across a wider range of camera orientations than previous approaches. We provide experiments using the ActorsHQ dataset with high-resolution input images. CloseUpAvatar demonstrates both qualitative and quantitative improvements over existing methods in rendering from novel wide range camera positions, while maintaining high FPS by limiting the number of required primitives."

    "abstract": "The RNA inverse folding problem, a key challenge in RNA design, involves identifying nucleotide sequences that can fold into desired secondary structures, which are critical for ensuring molecular stability and function. The inherent complexity of this task stems from the intricate relationship between sequence and structure, making it particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a framework, named HyperRNA, a generative model with an encoder-decoder architecture that leverages hypergraphs to design RNA sequences. Specifically, our HyperRNA model consists of three main components: preprocessing, encoding and decoding. In the preprocessing stage, graph structures are constructed by extracting the atom coordinates of RNA backbone based on 3-bead coarse-grained representation. The encoding stage processes these graphs, capturing higher order dependencies and complex biomolecular interactions using an attention embedding module and a hypergraph-based encoder. Finally, the decoding stage generates the RNA sequence in an autoregressive manner. We conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the PDBBind and RNAsolo datasets to evaluate the inverse folding task for RNA sequence generation and RNA-protein complex sequence generation. The experimental results demonstrate that HyperRNA not only outperforms existing RNA design methods but also highlights the potential of leveraging hypergraphs in RNA engineering."

    "abstract": "The Leidenfrost effect enables droplets to levitate above a solid surface, significantly reducing the resistance to droplet motion. In this study, a spiked surface is utilized to achieve fast directional transport of Leidenfrost droplets, with a maximum average speed reaching 8.36 m per second over a 10 cm distance,far exceeding the previously reported maximum speeds for droplet transport. When a droplet falls onto a substrate heated above the Leidenfrost temperature, it becomes trapped between spikes and levitates. The sides and bottom surface of the droplet undergo vaporization, creating a gas film between the solid wall and the droplet. However, this gas film is unstable and prone to rupture at certain points, causing the droplet to come into contact with the solid surface. Therefore, the droplets undergo violent boiling, leading to intense compression and bursting into smaller daughter droplets, which are then propelled rapidly along the substrate. Additionally, the asymmetric geometry of the spikes ensures that droplets move unidirectionally along the longitudinal direction. This study proposes a novel droplet self-propulsion mechanism, pioneering new strategies for enhancing droplet transport speed.."

They organize isolated persuasive techniques into coherent stories that justify actions, attribute blame, and evoke identification with ideological camps. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained narrative classification in biased news articles. We also explore article-bias classification as the precursor task to narrative classification and fine-grained persuasive technique identification. We develop INDI-PROP, the first ideologically grounded fine-grained narrative dataset with multi-level annotation for analyzing propaganda in Indian news media. Our dataset INDI-PROP comprises 1,266 articles focusing on two polarizing socio-political events in recent times: CAA and the Farmers' protest. Each article is annotated at three hierarchical levels: (i) ideological article-bias (pro-government, pro-opposition, neutral), (ii) event-specific fine-grained narrative frames anchored in ideological polarity and communicative intent, and (iii) persuasive techniques. We propose FANTA and TPTC, two GPT-4o-mini guided multi-hop prompt-based reasoning frameworks for the bias, narrative, and persuasive technique classification. FANTA leverages multi-layered communicative phenomena by integrating information extraction and contextual framing for hierarchical reasoning. On the other hand, TPTC adopts systematic decomposition of persuasive cues via a two-stage approach. Our evaluation suggests substantial improvement over underlying baselines in each case."

    "abstract": "Scene Text Editing (STE) involves replacing text in a scene image with new target text while preserving both the original text style and background texture. Existing methods suffer from two major challenges: inconsistency and length-insensitivity. They often fail to maintain coherence between the edited local patch and the surrounding area, and they struggle to handle significant differences in text length before and after editing. To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end framework called Global-Local Aware Scene Text Editing (GLASTE), which simultaneously incorporates high-level global contextual information along with delicate local features. Specifically, we design a global-local combination structure, joint global and local losses, and enhance text image features to ensure consistency in text style within local patches while maintaining harmony between local and global areas. Additionally, we express the text style as a vector independent of the image size, which can be transferred to target text images of various sizes. We use an affine fusion to fill target text images into the editing patch while maintaining their aspect ratio unchanged. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that our GLASTE model outperforms previous methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative results and effectively mitigates the two challenges."

Its central concept is the runnable directory -- a self-contained, independently executable unit with its own development, testing, and deployment lifecycles. Backed by a unified thin environment, shared helper utilities, and containerized Docker-based workflows, runnable directories enable consistent setups, isolated dependencies, and efficient CI/CD processes. The Causify Dev approach provides a practical middle ground between monorepo and multi-repo strategies, improving reliability and maintainability for growing, complex codebases."

While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $σ_{1}(ω\\rightarrow 0) \\equiv 1/ρ_{\\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $ρ_{c}/ρ_{ab} \\simeq 366$ at 300 K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$ and $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \\LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved."

Unlike the existing ECG models that exhibit a high misdiagnosis rate, our deep learning approaches can automatically extract the features of ECG data through end-to-end training. Specifically, we first devise EfficientECG, an accurate and lightweight classification model for ECG analysis based on the existing EfficientNet model, which can effectively handle high-frequency long-sequence ECG data with various leading types. On top of that, we next propose a cross-attention-based feature fusion model of EfficientECG for analysing multi-lead ECG data with multiple features (e.g., gender and age). Our evaluations on representative ECG datasets validate the superiority of our model against state-of-the-art works in terms of high precision, multi-feature fusion, and lightweights."

    "abstract": "Research on diamond has intensified due to its exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, making it a key material in quantum technologies and high-power applications. Diamonds with engineered nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers represent a very sensitive platform for quantum sensing, while high-optical quality diamond windows represent a fundamental safety component inside Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) systems in nuclear fusion reactors. A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\\tan δ$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice."

This paper introduces a fixed-initial-state constant-input dynamical system (FISCIDS) representation, which provides an exact and parametric model for a broad class of nonlinear functions. A FISCIDS representation of a given nonlinear function consists of an input-affine dynamical system with a fixed initial state and constant input. The argument of the function is applied as the constant input to the input-affine system, and the value of the function is the output of the input-affine system at a fixed terminal time. We show that any differentially algebraic function has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. We also show that there exists an analytic function that is not differentially algebraic but has a quadratic FISCIDS representation. Therefore, most functions in practical problems in science and engineering can be represented by a quadratic FISCIDS representation."

The attack works by systematically replacing a harmful keyword (e.g., \\textit{bomb}) with a benign token (e.g., \\textit{carrot}) across multiple in-context examples, provided a prefix to a harmful request. We demonstrate that this substitution leads to the internal representation of the benign token converging toward that of the harmful one, effectively embedding the harmful semantics under a euphemism. As a result, superficially innocuous prompts (e.g., ``How to build a carrot?'') are internally interpreted as disallowed instructions (e.g., ``How to build a bomb?''), thereby bypassing the model's safety alignment. We use interpretability tools to show that this semantic overwrite emerges layer by layer, with benign meanings in early layers converging into harmful semantics in later ones. Doublespeak is optimization-free, broadly transferable across model families, and achieves strong success rates on closed-source and open-source systems, reaching 74\\% ASR on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct with a single-sentence context override. Our findings highlight a new attack surface in the latent space of LLMs, revealing that current alignment strategies are insufficient and should instead operate at the representation level."

We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in the $L_p$-framework for $1 \\leq p \\leq 2$. For the case $p > 2$, where the $L_p$-theory fails, we develop a Sobolev space framework based on the scales of Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces associated with $φ(Δ)$. Within this setting, we prove the solvability and regularity of weak solutions. Our analysis relies on detailed estimates of the fundamental solutions, stochastic convolutions, Littlewood--Paley theory, and a fixed point argument. The results presented here extend and unify several previous works on fractional SPDEs by incorporating a general class of non-local operators and Lévy noises."

To improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor image classification, this paper proposes a brain tumor classification model based on an improved ResNet34 network. This model uses the ResNet34 residual network as the backbone network and incorporates multi-scale feature extraction. It uses a multi-scale input module as the first layer of the ResNet34 network and an Inception v2 module as the residual downsampling layer. Furthermore, a channel attention mechanism module assigns different weights to different channels of the image from a channel domain perspective, obtaining more important feature information. The results after a five-fold crossover experiment show that the average classification accuracy of the improved network model is approximately 98.8%, which is not only 1% higher than ResNet34, but also only 80% of the number of parameters of the original model. Therefore, the improved network model not only improves accuracy but also reduces clutter, achieving a classification effect with fewer parameters and higher accuracy."

    "abstract": "Machine learning models of vastly different modalities and architectures are being trained to predict the behavior of molecules, materials, and proteins. However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems. Models trained on different datasets have highly similar representations of small molecules, and machine learning interatomic potentials converge in representation space as they improve in performance, suggesting that foundation models learn a common underlying representation of physical reality. We then show two distinct regimes of scientific models: on inputs similar to those seen during training, high-performing models align closely and weak models diverge into local sub-optima in representation space; on vastly different structures from those seen during training, nearly all models collapse onto a low-information representation, indicating that today's models remain limited by training data and inductive bias and do not yet encode truly universal structure. Our findings establish representational alignment as a quantitative benchmark for foundation-level generality in scientific models. More broadly, our work can track the emergence of universal representations of matter as models scale, and for selecting and distilling models whose learned representations transfer best across modalities, domains of matter, and scientific tasks."

We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging."

Thus, they serve as a suitable model system to investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice. Here we report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics. Below 5 K, the system, despite its anisotropic electronic structure, could be effectively described by an isotropic two-band model and exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance ($\\propto B^{1.8}$). Upon warming, a crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, driven by the suppression of a hole pocket. Electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings gradually close from 25 to 70 K which is just below the N$\\mathrm{\\acute{e}}$el temperature. Within this temperature range, field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we attribute the low-temperature resistivity upturn to the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals."

By leveraging the superposition property of wireless signals, AirFL performs communication and model aggregation of the learning process simultaneously, significantly reducing latency, bandwidth, and energy consumption. This article offers a tutorial treatment of AirFL, presenting a novel classification into three design approaches: CSIT-aware, blind, and weighted AirFL.

    "abstract": "We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime."

Using a stable nonlinear car-following model, the study shows that minimal white Gaussian noise can destabilise the flow, leading to a phase transition from laminar to periodic dynamics through a nonlinear instability phenomenon, analogous to Kapitza's pendulum. Furthermore, a simple linear transformation of the model, which amplifies the response and introduces a positive acceleration bias, counteracts noise-induced effects and recovers the stability of uniform solutions. The findings are supported by simulations, offering new insights into the modelling and mitigation of oscillatory traffic dynamics."

    "abstract": "In large-scale AI training, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (s-MoE) layers enable scaling by activating only a small subset of experts per token. An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings. Together, these results build a principled framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing of s-MoE in AI models."

    "abstract": "We distinguish two frameworks for decisions under ambiguity: evaluate-then-aggregate (ETA) and aggregate-then-evaluate (ATE). Given a statistic that represents the decision maker's pure-risk preferences (such as expected utility) and an ambiguous act, an ETA model first evaluates the act under each plausible probabilistic model using this statistic and then aggregates the resulting evaluations according to ambiguity attitudes. In contrast, an ATE model first aggregates ambiguity by assigning the act a single representative distribution and then evaluates that distribution using the statistic. These frameworks differ in the order in which risk and ambiguity are processed, and they coincide when there is no ambiguity. While most existing ambiguity models fall within the ETA framework, our study focuses on the ATE framework, which is conceptually just as compelling and has been relatively neglected in the literature. We develop a Choquet ATE model, which generalizes the Choquet expected utility model by allowing arbitrary pure-risk preferences. We provide an axiomatization of this model in a Savage setting with an exogenous source of unambiguous events. The Choquet ATE framework allows us to analyze a wide range of ambiguity attitudes and their interplay with risk attitudes."

This concept has been known for a long time, attracting recent interest due to its advantageous mechanical properties, such as reusability, redundancy and limited crack propagation. New mathematical methods enable the generation of vast numbers of new topologically interlocking blocks. A natural next question is the quantification of the mechanical performance of these new blocks. We conduct a numerical study of topological interlocking assemblies whose blocks are constructed based on the hexagonal grid. By varying a design parameter used in the generation of these blocks, we study its influence on the structural performance of the entire assembly. The results improve our understanding of the link between the block parameters and the mechanical performance. This enhances the ability to custom design blocks for certain mechanical requirements of the topological interlocking assemblies."

    "abstract": "Public companies and institutional investors that hold Bitcoin face increasing pressure to show solvency, manage risk, and satisfy regulatory expectations without exposing internal wallet structures or trading strategies. This paper introduces the Treasury Proof Ledger (TPL), a Bitcoin-anchored logging framework for multi-domain Bitcoin treasuries that treats on-chain and off-chain exposures as a conserved state machine with an explicit fee sink. A TPL instance records proof-of-reserves snapshots, proof-of-transit receipts for movements between domains, and policy metadata, and it supports restricted views based on stakeholder permissions. We define an idealised TPL model, represent Bitcoin treasuries as multi-domain exposure vectors, and give deployment-level security notions including exposure soundness, policy completeness, non-equivocation, and privacy-compatible policy views. We then outline how practical, restricted forms of these guarantees can be achieved by combining standard proof-of-reserves and proof-of-transit techniques with hash-based commitments anchored on Bitcoin. The results are existence-type statements: they show which guarantees are achievable once economic and governance assumptions are set, without claiming that any current system already provides them. A stylised corporate-treasury example illustrates how TPL could support responsible transparency policies and future cross-institution checks consistent with Bitcoin's fixed monetary supply."

While traditional Structure-from-Motion pipelines handle such cases through geometric verification and outlier rejection, feed-forward 3D reconstruction models lack these explicit mechanisms, leading to degraded performance under in-the-wild conditions. In this paper, we discover that the existing feed-forward reconstruction model, e.g., VGGT, despite lacking explicit outlier-rejection mechanisms or noise-aware training, can inherently distinguish distractor images. Through an in-depth analysis under varying proportions of synthetic distractors, we identify a specific layer that naturally exhibits outlier-suppressing behavior. Further probing reveals that this layer encodes discriminative internal representations that enable an effective noise-filtering capability, which we simply leverage to perform outlier-view rejection in feed-forward 3D reconstruction without any additional fine-tuning or supervision. Extensive experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that this implicit filtering mechanism is consistent and generalizes well across diverse scenarios."

    "abstract": "Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning. Based on our observations, we propose a lean Unet architecture (LUnet) with a compact, flat hierarchy where channels are not doubled as resolution is halved. We evaluate on a public MRI dataset allowing comparable reporting, as well as on two internal CT datasets. We show that a state-of-the-art pruning solution (STAMP) mainly prunes from the layers with the highest number of channels. Comparatively, simply eliminating a random channel at the pruning-identified layer or at the largest layer achieves similar or better performance. Our proposed LUnet with fixed architectures and over 30 times fewer parameters achieves performance comparable to both conventional Unet counterparts and data-adaptively pruned networks. The proposed lean Unet with constant channel count across layers requires far fewer parameters while achieving performance superior to standard Unet for the same total number of parameters. Skip connections allow Unet bottleneck channels to be largely reduced, unlike standard encoder-decoder architectures requiring increased bottleneck channels for information propagation."

It analyzes the impacts of agriculture, industry, construction and services sectors on unemployment using annual data for the period 2000-2022. ARDL method is applied within the scope of the analysis. The findings are tested with FMOLS and CCR methods. The results show that growth in all sectors reduces the unemployment. A one-unit increase in the share of agriculture sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 0.471 points, 0.680 points in the industrial sector, 0.899 points in the construction sector and 1.383 points in the services sector in the short-run. The long-run coefficients reveal that the impacts of sectoral growth on unemployment are stronger in the long-run than in the short-run. A one unit increase in the share of the agricultural sector in GDP decreases the unemployment rate by 2.380 points, 4.057 points in the industrial sector, 1.761 points in the construction sector and 3.664 points in the services sector in the long-run. These findings show that jobless growth is not valid in Turkiye in general. On the contrary, economic growth plays an important role in reducing unemployment."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide a micro-foundation for the Cobb-Douglas production function based on statistical physics, and to launch a critique of its political-economic implications. By introducing the Maximum Entropy Principle and an axiom of scale invariance, we prove that in an economic system with incomplete information, the most unbiased distribution of micro-level technical coefficients must take the form of a truncated power law. Based on this, statistical aggregation naturally leads to the emergence of a constant-returns-to-scale Cobb-Douglas function at the macro level. This result not only provides a micro-foundation for neoclassical growth models that does not rely on a representative agent or value aggregation of capital but, more importantly, reveals that the aggregate production function is essentially a lossy compression of micro-level information. In this compression process, the social-historical relations embedded in distribution parameters are 'naturalized' into seemingly eternal technical laws, which is the manifestation of Marx's critique of 'fetishism' at the level of mathematical logic. This paper further deepens the understanding of the production function as a statistical phenomenon rather than a technical law through dialogues with Marx, the Cambridge School, and Shaikh."

Although the evaluation is limited by the small prototype size and the use of pion beams, the results indicate that the non-uniformity-related constant term is significantly below 1%. Furthermore, the test-beam data confirm that the contribution to the energy resolution arising from photo-electron statistics is approximately 1%/sqrt(E).

    "abstract": "Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural \"parallelization\" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems."

Numerous studies have leveraged the robustness of decision-making in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to address the optimization challenges in algorithm configuration. However, applying RL to DAC is challenging and often requires extensive domain expertise. We conduct a comprehensive study of deep-RL algorithms in DAC through a systematic analysis of controlling the population size parameter of the (1+($λ$,$λ$))-GA on OneMax instances. Our investigation of DDQN and PPO reveals two fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness in DAC: scalability degradation and learning instability. We trace these issues to two primary causes: under-exploration and planning horizon coverage, each of which can be effectively addressed through targeted solutions. To address under-exploration, we introduce an adaptive reward shifting mechanism that leverages reward distribution statistics to enhance DDQN agent exploration, eliminating the need for instance-specific hyperparameter tuning and ensuring consistent effectiveness across different problem scales. In dealing with the planning horizon coverage problem, we demonstrate that undiscounted learning effectively resolves it in DDQN, while PPO faces fundamental variance issues that necessitate alternative algorithmic designs. We further analyze the hyperparameter dependencies of PPO, showing that while hyperparameter optimization enhances learning stability, it consistently falls short in identifying effective policies across various configurations. Finally, we demonstrate that DDQN equipped with our adaptive reward shifting strategy achieves performance comparable to theoretically derived policies with vastly improved sample efficiency, outperforming prior DAC approaches by several orders of magnitude."

Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes. We show how the optimal material properties depend on the dark photon mass relative to the detector's plasma frequency, identifying the conditions under which a detector can saturate the theoretical upper limit. We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in visual question answering tasks, but their reliance on large numbers of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."

Such ad hoc practices are historically prone to misuse, and within MCP they threaten sensitive data and services. We present MICRYSCOPE, the first domain-specific framework for detecting cryptographic misuses in MCP implementations. MICRYSCOPE combines three key innovations: a cross-language intermediate representation that normalizes cryptographic APIs across diverse ecosystems, a hybrid dependency analysis that uncovers explicit and implicit function relationships (including insecure runtime compositions orchestrated by LLMs) and a taint-based misuse detector that tracks sensitive data flows and flags violations of established cryptographic rules. Applying MICRYSCOPE to 9,403 MCP servers, we identified 720 with cryptographic logic, of which 19.7% exhibited misuses. These flaws are concentrated in certain markets (e.g., Smithery Registry with 42% insecure servers), languages (Python at 34% misuse rate), and categories (Developer Tools and Data Science & ML accounting for over 50% of all misuses). Case studies reveal real-world consequences, including leaked API keys, insecure DES/ECB tools, and MD5-based authentication bypasses. Our study establishes the first ecosystem-wide view of cryptographic misuse in MCP and provides both tools and insights to strengthen the security foundations of this rapidly growing protocol."

    "abstract": "Using a generalised Floquet-Bloch theory, we present a mathematical method to construct eigenvectors for non-Hermitian Toeplitz operators. We extend the method to both banded Toeplitz operators and those with algebraically decaying, fully dense off-diagonal structure. We present sharp decay estimates for the amplitude of bulk eigenmodes as well as eigenmodes associated with defect eigenfrequencies inside the spectral band gap. The validity of those results is illustrated numerically and we show that banded approximations give poor reconstructions of the dense operators, due to the slow algebraic decay. We apply the insights gained to model the non-Hermitian skin effect in a three-dimensional system of subwavelength resonators, where the corresponding operator exhibits only algebraic decay of off-diagonal entries. We use our approach to demonstrate the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition between the non-Hermitian skin effect and defect-induced localisation in the bulk."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that think with images can interactively use tools to reason about visual inputs, but current approaches often rely on a narrow set of tools with limited real-world necessity and scalability. In this work, we first reveal a critical and previously overlooked weakness: even state-of-the-art MLLMs are surprisingly brittle, showing significant performance degradation on images with simple orientation changes or natural corruptions, underscoring the need for more robust tool-based reasoning. To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries. We train our model using a two-stage methodology, beginning with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a high-quality dataset curated for complex, multi-turn tool composition and error recovery, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel and dense process reward function to encourage strategic and efficient tool use. To facilitate this research, we construct new SFT and RL datasets and introduce a challenging new benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate robustness to orientation changes and multi-tool reasoning. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series show that our approach significantly improves model performance and fosters emergent capabilities such as flexible tool composition, efficient chained execution, and robust error recovery from runtime feedback.

    "abstract": "Two-stage learning pipeline has achieved promising results in unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID). It first performs single-modality learning and then operates cross-modality learning to tackle the modality discrepancy. Although promising, this pipeline inevitably introduces modality bias: modality-specific cues learned in the single-modality training naturally propagate into the following cross-modality learning, impairing identity discrimination and generalization. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels. At the model level, we propose a Causality-inspired Adjustment Intervention (CAI) module that replaces likelihood-based modeling with causal modeling, preventing modality-induced spurious patterns from being introduced, leading to a low-biased model. At the optimization level, a Collaborative Bias-free Training (CBT) strategy is introduced to interrupt the propagation of modality bias across data, labels, and features by integrating modality-specific augmentation, label refinement, and feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMDL could enable modality-invariant feature learning and a more generalized model."

    "abstract": "Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels."

In this work, we combine theory and experiment to construct an accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Ca-H system and identify the stability ranges of the candidate superconducting phases by considering anharmonic effects. Our results demonstrate that type-I clathrate Ca8H46-delta structures become thermodynamically stable at 0 K when anharmonic effects are considered. Notably, we found that the previously predicted CaH6 phase achieves stability above 500 K, underscoring the significant role of temperature and anharmonic effects in stabilizing this intriguing high-pressure phase. Experimentally, we have successfully synthesized Ca8H46-delta phases at low temperatures, thereby validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings offer insights into the structure and superconducting mechanisms of hydrides."

As our first contribution, we exclude an analogous algorithm even for highly restricted fair means clustering instances. We then proceed to obtain a full complexity landscape of the problem, and establish tractability results which capture three means of circumventing our obtained lower bound: placing additional constraints on the problem instances, fixed-parameter approximation, or using an alternative parameterization targeting tree-like matrices."

While most of the effort has focused on increasing the number of SNe Ia observed in the optical, near-infrared (NIR) observations remain scarce despite their advantages, that is, reduced dust extinction and a more intrinsic standard candle behavior, requiring little to no empirical corrections. Here, we present ASNOS (ANDICAM-SOFI Near-infrared and Optical type Ia Supernova), a dataset with sample size of 1,482 epochs in the $BVRIYJH$ filters from the ANDICAM instrument on the 1.3-meter SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, along with 125 $JHK$ epochs from the SOFI instrument on the 3.58-meter New Technology Telescope on the La Silla Observatory. Additionally, we incorporate optical forced photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The sample comprises 41 SNe Ia in total, including 29 normal events, eight 1991T-like objects, and four peculiar subtypes, all located at redshifts $z < 0.085$. This paper provides a detailed overview of the ASNOS sample selection, data reduction, SN photometry, host-galaxy spectral energy distribution construction, both global and local, and SN light-curve fitting using three methods: SALT3-NIR, SNooPy, and BayeSN.

    "abstract": "The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) measures radio emission from high-energy extensive air showers. Consisting of 153 autonomous radio-detector stations spread over $17$\\,km$^2$, it detects radio waves in the frequency range of $30$ to $80$\\,MHz. Accurate characterization of the detector response is crucial for proper interpretation of the collected data. Previously, this was achieved through laboratory measurements of the analog chain and simulations and measurements of the antenna's directional response. In this paper, we perform an absolute calibration using the continuously monitored sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission. Calibration is done by comparing the average frequency spectra recorded by the stations with predictions from seven different models of the full radio sky, accounting for the system response, which includes the antenna, filters, and amplifiers. The analysis of the calibration constants over a period of seven years shows no relevant and no significant ageing effect in the AERA antennas. This result confirms the long-term stability of the detector stations and demonstrates the possibility for a radio detector to effectively monitor ageing effects of other detectors operating over extended periods."

However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies."

The gripper is driven by a servo-actuated Scotch--yoke mechanism, and includes separator leaves that form a conical frustum for fruit isolation, with an integrated micro-servo cutter for pedicel cutting. For perception, an RGB--D camera and a Detectron2-based pipeline perform semantic segmentation of ripe/unripe tomatoes and keypoint localization of the pedicel and fruit center under occlusion and variable illumination. An analytical model derived using the principle of virtual work relates servo torque to grasp force, enabling design-level reasoning about actuation requirements. During execution, closed-loop grasp-force regulation is achieved using a proportional--integral--derivative controller with feedback from force-sensitive resistors mounted on selected fingers to prevent slip and bruising. Motion execution is supported by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)--based trajectory planning for a 5-DOF manipulator. Experiments demonstrate complete picking cycles (approach, separation, cutting, grasping, transport, release) with an average cycle time of 24.34~s and an overall success rate of approximately 80\\%, while maintaining low grasp forces (0.20--0.50~N). These results validate the proposed hybrid gripper and integrated vision--control pipeline for reliable harvesting in cluttered environments."

While these tools hold societal promise, they also risk widening digital divides due to uneven adoption and low awareness of their limitations. This study presents the first comprehensive empirical mapping of GenAI adoption, usage patterns, and literacy in Italy, based on newly collected survey data from 1,906 Italian-speaking adults. Our findings reveal widespread adoption for both work and personal use, including sensitive tasks like emotional support and medical advice. Crucially, GenAI is supplanting other technologies to become a primary information source: this trend persists despite low user digital literacy, posing a risk as users struggle to recognize errors or misinformation. Moreover, we identify a significant gender divide -- particularly pronounced in older generations -- where women are half as likely to adopt GenAI and use it less frequently than men. While we find literacy to be a key predictor of adoption, it only partially explains this disparity, suggesting that other barriers are at play. Overall, our data provide granular insights into the multipurpose usage of GenAI, highlighting the dual need for targeted educational initiatives and further investigation into the underlying barriers to equitable participation that competence alone cannot explain."

Near-petahertz fieldoscopy has recently demonstrated sub-cycle access to light-matter interactions, enabling label-free spectro-microscopy of liquids and solids with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, detection sensitivity, and dynamic range. However, current implementations still rely on temporal scanning and averaging over many laser pulses. Here, we introduce photonic time-stretch fieldoscopy, enabling single-shot electric-field detection at near-petahertz frequencies. Numerical results demonstrate that integrating fieldoscopy with a nonlinear time lens enables the real-time acquisition of ultrashort optical waveforms with a detection bandwidth approaching petahertz. The resulting large temporal aperture and attosecond resolution allow direct single-shot detection of transient electric fields generated in solid or liquid samples. This concept opens new avenues for petahertz electronics, ultrafast spectro-microscopy, and the study of dynamic, non-repetitive optical phenomena"

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive hemodynamic analysis of 74 patient-specific abdominal aortas, representing one of the largest Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) cohorts reported to date. A multiscale framework coupling 0D-1D systemic circulation models with 3D stabilized finite-element simulations is used to generate physiologically consistent boundary conditions and high-fidelity flow fields. From each model, we extract Time Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS), Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Local Normalized Helicity (LNH) indicators alongside an extended set of geometric descriptors characterizing diameter, curvature and torsion. This study provides a clear and comprehensive view of how aneurysm shape influences blood-flow behavior, supported by one of the largest systematically analyzed CFD datasets of AAAs to date. Our results show that specific geometric features reliably shape shear-stress patterns, suggesting that these geometry-driven flow signatures could serve as valuable biomarkers for patient-specific risk assessment. Together, these insights highlight the potential of incorporating detailed geometric descriptors into future models that aim to predict AAA growth and rupture."

We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant.

Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately."

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have substantially advanced object detection capabilities, particularly in remote sensing imagery. However, challenges persist, especially in detecting small objects where the high resolution of these images and the small size of target objects often result in a loss of critical information in the deeper layers of conventional CNNs. Additionally, the extensive spatial redundancy and intricate background details typical in remote-sensing images tend to obscure these small targets. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Kernel Selection Network (MKSNet), a novel network architecture featuring a novel Multi-Kernel Selection mechanism. The MKS mechanism utilizes large convolutional kernels to effectively capture an extensive range of contextual information. This innovative design allows for adaptive kernel size selection, significantly enhancing the network's ability to dynamically process and emphasize crucial spatial details for small object detection. Furthermore, MKSNet also incorporates a dual attention mechanism, merging spatial and channel attention modules. The spatial attention module adaptively fine-tunes the spatial weights of feature maps, focusing more intensively on relevant regions while mitigating background noise. Simultaneously, the channel attention module optimizes channel information selection, improving feature representation and detection accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the DOTA-v1.0 and HRSC2016 benchmark demonstrate that MKSNet substantially surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in detecting small objects in remote sensing images. These results highlight MKSNet's superior ability to manage the complexities associated with multi-scale and high-resolution image data, confirming its effectiveness and innovation in remote sensing object detection."

To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs.

The relaxation time from nonequilibrium to equilibrium in the QCD phase diagram is extracted from the Langevin simulations of the QCD-assisted relaxation dynamic model. It is found that in a narrow region along the phase boundary radiated from the CEP, the relaxation time is enhanced significantly. Outside this narrow region, the relaxation time drops drastically, which implies that the dynamic critical region is small in the QCD phase diagram. We also find that the effects of critical slowing down are mild on the chemical freeze-out curves."

Here we report the first measurements of the magnetic field of the solar poles taken when Solar Orbiter was at heliographic latitudes ranging between 14.9$^\\circ$ and 16.7$^\\circ$. The data-sets were collected by the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI-HRT) on board Solar Orbiter. Two sets of observations, approximately one month apart, for the south and north pole are considered in this work. The magnetic flux and flux density measured during these campaigns are reported as a function of the heliographic latitude observed by SO/PHI-HRT. The net fluxes show a different latitudinal distribution for the two polar caps. We also discuss the observed dependence of the measured fluxes on the viewing angle. These first results highlight the importance of high-resolution direct measurements of the polar field, paving the way to the high-latitude observations planned for SO/PHI-HRT in the coming years."

Addressing the systematic misalignment between existing theoretical models and real-world economic complexities, we identify three critical gaps: (1) data modality mismatch where unstructured textual sources (e.g. negotiation records, approval documents) impede accurate customer profiling; (2) dynamic feature entanglement challenges in modeling nonlinear price elasticity and time-varying attributes; (3) operational infeasibility caused by multi-tier business constraints. Our framework introduces a tri-level architecture for above challenges. We design a hybrid knowledge fusion engine employing large language models (LLMs) for deep semantic parsing of unstructured text, transforming distributor agreements and sales assessments into structured features while integrating managerial expertise. Then a game-theoretic constrained optimization mechanism is employed to dynamically reconcile supply chain interests through bilateral utility functions, encoding manufacturer-distributor profit redistribution as endogenous objectives under hierarchical constraints. Finally an interpretable decision distillation interface leveraging LLM-guided symbolic regression to find and optimize pricing strategies and auditable business rules embeds economic priors (e.g. non-negative elasticity) as hard constraints during mathematical expression search. We validate the framework in real retail environments achieving higher profits versus systematic B2C baselines while ensuring operational feasibility. This establishes a close-loop pipeline unifying unstructured knowledge injection, multi-agent optimization, and interpretable strategy synthesis for real economic intelligence."

We prove global asymptotic stability and exclusion of Zeno behavior. Monte Carlo simulations ($N=100$) show 43.6\\% fewer events than optimally tuned isotropic methods while achieving $2.1\\times$ better control performance than time-varying alternatives.

We propose a retrieval-augmented framework for tooth completion that integrates a prototype memory into standard encoder--decoder pipelines. After encoding a partial input into a global descriptor, the model retrieves the nearest manifold prototype from a learnable memory and fuses it with the query feature through confidence-gated weighting before decoding. The memory is optimized end-to-end and self-organizes into reusable tooth-shape prototypes without requiring tooth-position labels, thereby providing structural priors that stabilize missing-region inference and free decoder capacity for detail recovery. The module is plug-and-play and compatible with common completion backbones, while keeping the same training losses. Experiments on a self-processed Teeth3DS benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements in Chamfer Distance, with visualizations showing sharper cusps, ridges, and interproximal transitions. Our approach provides a simple yet effective way to exploit cross-sample regularities for more accurate and faithful dental point-cloud completion."

Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was implemented to analyse the relationship between taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among epiphytic communities, host-tree characteristics and microclimatic variation.Within-tree vertical turnover of bryophyte communities was significantly about 30% higher than horizontal turnover among-trees. Thus, the sharp vertical variations in microclimatic conditions from tree base to canopy are more important than differences in age, reflecting the likelihood of colonization, area, and habitat conditions between young and old trees, in shaping the composition of epiphytic bryophyte communities."

    "abstract": "Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) refers to the task of predicting a continuous target variable from an input time series. It appears in many domains, including healthcare, finance, environmental monitoring, and engineering. In these settings, accurate predictions and trustworthy reasoning are both essential. Although state-of-the-art TSER models achieve strong predictive performance, they typically operate as black boxes, making it difficult to understand which temporal patterns drive their decisions. Post-hoc interpretability techniques, such as feature attribution, aim to to explain how the model arrives at its predictions, but often produce coarse, noisy, or unstable explanations. Recently, inherently interpretable approaches based on concepts, additive decompositions, or symbolic regression, have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these approaches remain limited: they require explicit supervision on the concepts themselves, often cannot capture interactions between time-series features, lack expressiveness for complex temporal patterns, and struggle to scale to high-dimensional multivariate data. To address these limitations, we propose MAGNETS (Mask-and-AGgregate NEtwork for Time Series), an inherently interpretable neural architecture for TSER. MAGNETS learns a compact set of human-understandable concepts without requiring any annotations. Each concept corresponds to a learned, mask-based aggregation over selected input features, explicitly revealing both which features drive predictions and when they matter in the sequence. Predictions are formed as combinations of these learned concepts through a transparent, additive structure, enabling clear insight into the model's decision process."

The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite."

This hybrid design enables robust detection of both explicit violations and novel edge cases that evade traditional classifiers. Multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual) are processed through both pipelines, with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) distilling knowledge into each to boost accuracy while keeping inference lightweight. In production, the classification pipeline achieves 67% recall at 80% precision, and the similarity pipeline achieves 76% recall at 80% precision.

Specifically, active front-end (AFE) drives have become popular due to their ability to deliver power while maintaining safe electrical setpoints. However, under abnormal grid conditions such as phase loss, conventional AFE control may fail to enforce safety constraints, potentially leading to drive shutdown and significant financial losses. In this work, we propose using reference-tracking Performance Boosting (rPB) to improve the resilience of standard AFE control to faults. This neural-network control framework provides a principled way to optimize transient performance while preserving the steady-state tracking properties of AFE-based drives. By carefully shaping the input signals to the rPB controller, we ensure that it activates only during grid faults, leaving nominal operation unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed approach successfully maintains the DC bus voltage and the grid current within safe limits during single-phase loss events."

    "abstract": "Modelling multivariate extreme events is essential when extrapolating beyond the range of observed data. Parametric models that are suitable for real-world extremes must be flexible -- particularly in their ability to capture asymmetric dependence structures -- while also remaining parsimonious for interpretability and computationally scalable in high dimensions. Although many models have been proposed, it is rare for any single construction to satisfy all of these requirements. For instance, the popular Hüsler-Reiss model is limited to symmetric dependence structures. In this manuscript, we introduce a class of additive factor models and derive their extreme-value limits. This leads to a broad and tractable family of models characterised by a manageable number of parameters. These models naturally accommodate asymmetric tail dependence and allow for non-stationary behaviour. We present the limiting models from both the componentwise-maxima and Peaks-over-Thresholds perspectives, via the multivariate extreme value and multivariate generalized Pareto distributions, respectively. Simulation studies illustrate identifiability properties based on existing inference methodologies. Finally, applications to summer temperature maxima in Melbourne, Australia, and to weekly negative returns from four major UK banks demonstrate improved fit compared with the Hüsler-Reiss model."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in numerous vision-language tasks yet suffer from hallucinations, producing content inconsistent with input visuals, that undermine reliability in precision-sensitive domains. This issue stems from a fundamental problem of visual neglect, where models fail to adequately prioritize input images. Existing methods typically alleviate hallucinations by intervening in the attention score or output logits, focusing on \"how to intervene\" but overlooking the prerequisite \"when to intervene\", which leads to the \"over-intervention\" problem and subsequently introduces new hallucinations and unnecessary computational overhead. To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and different MLLM families demonstrate that V-ITI consistently mitigates vision-related hallucinations while preserving general task performance."

Synergistic Polynomial Fusion (SPF) serves the representation role, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization to efficiently capture high-order cross-modal interactions. Pareto Gradient Modulator (PGM) serves the optimization role, steering updates along Pareto-optimal directions across competing objectives to alleviate gradient conflicts and improve stability. Experiments show that CSS outperforms existing representative methods on IEMOCAP and MELD in both accuracy and training stability, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex multimodal scenarios."

    "abstract": "Layered Zintl compounds exhibit significant tunability of thermoelectric (TE) parameters facilitated by their multiple elemental combinations and flexibility in stacking order within the layers. In this work, the effect of stacking order on TE properties of theoretically predicted layered Zintl compounds XZnBi (X = Rb, Cs) is studied using 1st-principles calculations and Boltzmann equations. The materials are semiconductors having moderate band gaps ranging from 0.44 to 0.52 eV. There exist six identical hole pockets for valence band maxima due to the crystal symmetry. This leads to high band degeneracy but simultaneously promotes intervalley scatterings. While as for conduction bands, the Fermi surface consists of a single but highly anisotropic, quasi-two dimensional electron pockets with cylindrical shape along z-axis. This kind of Fermi surface is a characteristic of a pudding mold band shape. It facilitates a unique combination of heavy and light electron masses, simultaneously optimizing Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. At first, electronic transport coefficients are calculated using constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) or electron-phonon coupling matrix elements (el-ph). The calculated relaxation times are then integrated with transport results to get the realistic values of TE parameters. The analysis of three-phonon scattering reveals low thermal conductivity ($k_{l}$) below 2 W/m/K in these compounds. The $k_{l}$ also depends on stacking order with the values of nearly half in AB stacking as compared to that of AA stacking. These combined factors lead to a high ZT at 900 K, reaching to a maximum of 2.42 using CRTA and 0.52 when el-ph are included. The study highlights the potential of XZnBi systems as promising TE materials as well as the critical roles of stacking and el-ph in accurately evaluating TE properties."

    "abstract": "We propose a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for a broad class of unconstrained controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and establish its mean-square exponential stability in the infinite-horizon limit. At each prediction step of the MPC iteration, the nonlinear controlled SDE is approximated by its linearization at the origin, with the sampled state of the nonlinear system as initial condition, yielding a finite-horizon stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ) optimal control problem. The resulting optimal control is then applied to the original nonlinear stochastic dynamics until the next sampling instant. This construction leads to a delayed SMPC scheme whose closed-loop behavior is governed by a coupled time-delay SDE system, a setting that has not been analyzed before. We prove global mean-square exponential stability for linear and mildly nonlinear SDEs by exploiting the exponential convergence of the Riccati equation to the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). For strongly nonlinear SDEs, we establish local mean-square exponential stability by combining exponential Riccati convergence with stopping-time techniques and Grönwall-type estimates. It is observed that, to ensure the desired local stability properties, the nonlinearities of the SDE are allowed to have polynomial growth but not exponential growth, distinguishing SMPC from its deterministic counterpart. These results provide the first rigorous mean-square stability guarantees for SMPC of SDE systems with delayed state information, thereby advancing the theoretical foundations of stochastic predictive control."

We propose CSMapping, a system that produces accurate semantic maps and topological road centerlines whose quality consistently increases with more crowdsourced data. For semantic mapping, we train a latent diffusion model on HD maps (optionally conditioned on SD maps) to learn a generative prior of real-world map structure, without requiring paired crowdsourced/HD-map supervision. This prior is incorporated via constrained MAP optimization in latent space, ensuring robustness to severe noise and plausible completion in unobserved areas. Initialization uses a robust vectorized mapping module followed by diffusion inversion; optimization employs efficient Gaussian-basis reparameterization, projected gradient descent zobracket multi-start, and latent-space factor-graph for global consistency. For topological mapping, we apply confidence-weighted k-medoids clustering and kinematic refinement to trajectories, yielding smooth, human-like centerlines robust to trajectory variation. Experiments on nuScenes, Argoverse 2, and a large proprietary dataset achieve state-of-the-art semantic and topological mapping performance, with thorough ablation and scalability studies."

We propose a proof-of-concept framework that integrates YOLOv8 and v11 for dancer detection with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, enabling the tracking and quantification of dancer movements in video recordings without specialized equipment or markers. Our approach identifies dancers within video frames, counts discrete dance steps, calculates spatial coverage patterns, and measures rhythm consistency across performance sequences. Testing this framework on a single 49-second recording of Ghanaian AfroBeats dance demonstrates technical feasibility, with the system achieving approximately 94% detection precision and 89% recall on manually inspected samples. The pixel-level segmentation provided by SAM, achieving approximately 83% intersection-over-union with visual inspection, enables motion quantification that captures body configuration changes beyond what bounding-box approaches can represent. Analysis of this preliminary case study indicates that the dancer classified as primary by our system executed 23% more steps with 37% higher motion intensity and utilized 42% more performance space compared to dancers classified as secondary. However, this work represents an early-stage investigation with substantial limitations including single-video validation, absence of systematic ground truth annotations, and lack of comparison with existing pose estimation methods. We present this framework to demonstrate technical feasibility, identify promising directions for quantitative dance metrics, and establish a foundation for future systematic validation studies."

However, a comprehensive survey that provides a systematic overview,from empirical channel features to modeling methodologies and standardized simulators,remains unavailable. In this paper, the key requirements and challenges in ISAC channel research are first analyzed, followed by a structured overview of the standardization workflow throughout the 3GPP Release 19 process. Then, critical aspects of ISAC channels, including physical objects, target channels, and background channels, are examined in depth, together with additional features such as spatial consistency, environment objects, Doppler characteristics, and shared clusters, supported by measurement-based analysis. To establish a unified ISAC channel modeling framework, an Extended Geometry-based Stochastic Model (E-GBSM) is proposed, incorporating all the aforementioned ISAC channel characteristics. Finally, a standardized simulator is developed based on E-GBSM, and a two-phase calibration procedure aligned with 3GPP Release 19 is conducted to validate both the model and the simulator, demonstrating close agreement with industrial reference results. Overall, this paper provides a systematic survey of 3GPP Release 19 ISAC channel standardization and offers insights into best practices for new feature characterization, unified modeling methodology, and standardized simulator implementation, which can effectively supporting ISAC technology evaluation and future 6G standardization."

We then conduct a systematic, large scale comparative study of 8 reasoning strategies and 3 Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) across 8 diverse datasets, assessing both summary quality and faithfulness. Our findings show that reasoning is not a universal solution and its effectiveness is highly dependent on the specific strategy and context. Specifically, we observe a trade-off between summary quality and factual faithfulness: explicit reasoning strategies tend to improve fluency at the expense of factual grounding, while implicit reasoning in LRMs exhibits the inverse pattern. Furthermore, increasing an LRM's internal reasoning budget does not improve, and can even hurt, factual consistency, suggesting that effective summarization demands faithful compression rather than creative over-thinking."

However, the STFT spectrogram has the same frequency resolution at different frequency bins, which results in an inferior performance, especially for singing voices. Motivated by this, we propose a universal harmonic discriminator for dynamic frequency resolution modeling and harmonic tracking. Specifically, we design a harmonic filter with learnable triangular band-pass filter banks, where each frequency bin has a flexible bandwidth. Additionally, we add a half-harmonic to capture fine-grained harmonic relationships at low-frequency band.

We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field."

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}. Yet many errors manifest not in the execution itself but in the resulting outcome, such as an unintended object state or incorrect spatial arrangement. To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications."

It has been widely applied to uncover the subtypes of many diseases and inform our understanding of them. But how robust is its performance? In this paper, we develop a principled Bayesian subtype variant of the event-based model (BEBMS) and compare its performance to SuStaIn in a variety of synthetic data experiments with varied levels of model misspecification. BEBMS substantially outperforms SuStaIn across ordering, staging, and subtype assignment tasks. Further, we apply BEBMS and SuStaIn to a real-world Alzheimer's data set. We find BEBMS has results that are more consistent with the scientific consensus of Alzheimer's disease progression than SuStaIn."

We introduce AsymPuzl, a minimal but expressive two-agent puzzle environment designed to isolate communication under information asymmetry. Each agent observes complementary but incomplete views of a symbolic puzzle and must exchange messages to solve it cooperatively. Using a diverse set of current-generation and open-source LLMs, we show that (i) strong models such as GPT-5 and Claude-4.0 reliably converge across puzzle sizes on the solution by sharing complete information in two turns, (ii) weaker models often ignore partner messages or over-correct their hypotheses, and (iii) feedback design is non-trivial: simple self-feedback improves success rates, while detailed joint feedback can hurt performance. These findings show that even in simple cooperative tasks, LLM communication strategies diverge and depend on the granularity of feedback signals. AsymPuzl thus provides a testbed for probing the limits of multi-turn cooperation and opens avenues for studying coordination mechanisms."

    "abstract": "In recent years, financial sentiment analysis of public opinion has become increasingly important for market forecasting and risk assessment. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively integrate diverse opinion modalities and capture fine-grained interactions across them. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that integrates two distinct modalities of financial opinions: recency modality (timely opinions) and popularity modality (trending opinions), through a novel cross-modal attention mechanism specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis. While both modalities consist of textual data, they represent fundamentally different information channels: recency-driven market updates versus popularity-driven collective sentiment. Our model first uses BERT (Chinese-wwm-ext) for feature embedding and then employs our proposed Financial Multi-Head Cross-Attention (FMHCA) structure to facilitate information exchange between these distinct opinion modalities. The processed features are optimized through a transformer layer and fused using multimodal factored bilinear pooling for classification into negative, neutral, and positive sentiment. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive dataset covering 837 companies demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, significantly outperforming baselines including BERT+Transformer by 21 percent. These results highlight the potential of our framework to support more accurate financial decision-making and risk management."

    "abstract": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility."

    "abstract": "The mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming, high metallicity galaxies is dominated by emission features from aromatic and aliphatic bonds in small carbonaceous dust grains, often referred to as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In metal-poor galaxies, the abundance of PAHs relative to the total dust sharply declines, but the origin of this deficit is unknown. We present JWST observations that detect and resolve emission from PAHs in the 7% Solar metallicity galaxy Sextans A, representing the lowest metallicity detection of PAH emission to date. In contrast to higher metallicity galaxies, the clumps of PAH emission are compact (0.5-1.5'' or 3-10 pc), which explains why PAH emission evaded detection by lower resolution instruments like Spitzer. Ratios between the 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 $μ$m PAH features indicate that the PAH grains in Sextans A are small and neutral, with no evidence of significant processing from the hard radiation fields within the galaxy. These results favor inhibited grain growth over enhanced destruction as the origin of the low PAH abundance in Sextans A. The compact clumps of PAH emission are likely active sites of in-situ PAH growth within a dense, well-shielded phase of the interstellar medium. Our results show that PAHs can form and survive in extremely metal-poor environments common early in the evolution of the Universe."

    "abstract": "Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\\cal S}=\\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\\langle {\\cal S}\\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem."

However, despite their popularity, the exact use and applicability of SNICs remains an ongoing debate. These debates are exacerbated by the incorporation of accelerators into SNIC, allowing them to relieve their host's CPUs of various tasks. In this work, we carry out a chronological analysis of SNICs, using 370 articles published in the past 15 years, from 2010 to 2024, to gain some insight into SNICs; and shed some light on their evolution, manufacturers, use cases, and application domains."

We establish convergence guarantees for a general class of such discrete schemes, and present a multinomial update rule as a concrete example, supported by empirical evaluation. This perspective opens new avenues for efficient training, particularly for models with inherently discrete structure."

We find that the two transitions do not coincide, and their critical behaviors differ markedly. In particular, LLT percolation displays standard mean-field percolation criticality that is fundamentally distinct from the peculiar critical behavior of the Anderson transition on the Bethe lattice. Our results provide an exact benchmark showing that, while geometrically intuitive, the LLT does not capture the true quantum critical properties of localization."

You can pause the movie, ask questions using a clicker system, display the results, and move on if the subject is mastered or explain more if items are not understood. This paper shows the results of teaching magnetism in a dome theater, showing that both students and teachers nearly double their understanding of magnetism topics after one viewing.

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms are the core of foundation models, but their quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for scaling. This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

To address inherent data-quality challenges, including missing information and substantial class imbalance, we employ a rigorous preprocessing pipeline utilizing mode imputation and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE). We utilize non-parametric ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) to capture complex interactions and heterogeneity often missed by linear models, while Shapley Additive Explanations are employed to ensure interpretability and isolate marginal feature effects. Our analysis reveals that vehicle count, speed limits, lighting, and road surface conditions are the primary predictors of severity, with police attendance and junction characteristics further distinguishing severe collisions. Spatially, while pedestrian risk is concentrated in dense urban Local Authority Districts (LADs), we identify that certain rural LADs experience disproportionately severe outcomes conditional on a collision occurring. These findings underscore the value of combining spatial analysis with interpretable machine learning to guide geographically targeted speed management, infrastructure investment, and enforcement strategies."

We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness."

    "abstract": "As augmented large language models (LLMs) with external tools become increasingly popular in web applications, improving augmented LLM inference serving efficiency and optimizing service-level objectives (SLOs) are critical for enhancing user experience. To achieve this, inference systems must maximize request handling within latency constraints, referred to as increasing effective throughput. However, existing systems face two major challenges: (i) reliance on first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling causes severe head-of-line blocking, leading to queuing delays exceeding the SLOs for many requests; and (ii) static batch token limit, which fails to adapt to fluctuating loads and hardware conditions. Both of these factors degrade effective throughput and service quality. This paper presents AugServe, an efficient inference framework designed to reduce queueing latency and enhance effective throughput for augmented LLM inference services. The core idea of AugServe is a two-stage adaptive request scheduling strategy. Specifically, AugServe combines the inference features of augmented LLM requests to optimize the order of scheduling decisions (stage I). These decisions are continuously refined with runtime information (stage II), adapting to both request characteristics and system capabilities. In addition, AugServe dynamically adjusts the token batching mechanism based on hardware status and real-time load, further enhancing throughput performance. Experimental results show that AugServe achieves 4.7-33.1x and 3.3-13.2x higher effective throughput than vLLM and InferCept, while reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 96.3% and 95.0%, respectively."

However, those data providers, and, in general, the public, lack methods to efficiently verify that models trained on their data satisfy DP guarantees. The amount of compute needed to verify DP guarantees for current algorithms scales with the amount of compute required to train the model. In this paper we design the first DP algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility trade-offs but whose DP guarantees can be verified cheaper than training. We focus on DP stochastic convex optimization (DP-SCO), where optimal privacy-utility trade-offs are known. Here we show we can obtain tight privacy-utility trade-offs by privately minimizing a series of regularized objectives and only using the standard DP composition bound. Crucially, this method can be verified with much less compute than training. This leads to the first known DP-SCO algorithm with near optimal privacy-utility whose DP verification scales better than training cost, significantly reducing verification costs on large datasets."

We are therefore investigating the extent to which the opening of the conversation can be trained using the user's body language as an input for machine learning to ensure smooth conversation starts for the interaction. In this paper we propose the Interaction Initiation System (IIS) which we developed, trained and validated using an in-the-wild data set.

Over the period of use we collected the data of \\textit{N} = 201 single user interactions for the training of the algorithms.

Typically, platforms passively predict relevance based on available signals and in some cases offer query refinements. The shift from traditional search to conversational AI provides a new approach. When a user's query is ambiguous, a Large Language Model (LLM) can proactively offer several clarifying follow-up prompts. In this paper we consider the following: what if some of these follow-up prompts can be ``sponsored,'' i.e., selected for their advertising potential. How should these ``suggestion slots'' be allocated? And, how does this new mechanism interact with the traditional ad auction that might follow? This paper introduces a formal model for designing and analyzing these interactive platforms. We use this model to investigate a critical engineering choice: whether it is better to build an end-to-end pipeline that jointly optimizes the user interaction and the final ad auction, or to decouple them into separate mechanisms for the suggestion slots and another for the subsequent ad slot. We show that the VCG mechanism can be adopted to jointly optimize the sponsored suggestion and the ads that follow; while this mechanism is more complex, it achieves outcomes that are efficient and truthful. On the other hand, we prove that the simple-to-implement modular approach suffers from strategic inefficiency: its Price of Anarchy is unbounded."

They enable microscopic insights into material behavior through Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can crucially expedite material design and discovery. However, insufficiently broad and systematically biased reference data affect the predictive quality of the learned models. Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant. Our approach is model-agnostic, applicable to multi-component systems with solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions, and compliant with top-down training on other experimental properties. Therefore, our approach can serve as an essential step towards highly accurate application-specific and foundational machine learning potentials."

    "abstract": "We present the design and numerical simulation of a spiking neuron capable of on-chip machine learning. Built within the CMOS+X framework, the spiking neuron consists of an NMOS transistor combined with a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This NMOS+MTJ unit, when simulated in the industry-standard circuit simulation software LTspice, reproduces multiple functions of a biological neuron, including threshold spiking, latency, refractory periods, synaptic integration, inhibition, and adaptation. These behaviors arise from the intrinsic magnetization dynamics of the MTJ and do not require any additional control circuitry. By interconnecting the NMOS+MTJ neurons, we construct a model of an analog multilayer network that learns through spike-timing-dependent weight updates derived from a gradient-descent rule, with both training and inference modeled in the analog domain. The simulated CMOS+X network achieves reliable spike propagation and successful training on a nonlinear task, indicating a feasible path toward compact, low-power, in-memory neuromorphic hardware for edge applications."

    "abstract": "Disk and halo stars are generally classified using several conventional methods, such as the Toomre diagram, sharp cuts in metallicity ([Fe/H]), vertical distance ($\\left|Z\\right|$) from the Galactic plane, or thresholds on the orbital circularity parameter ($ε$). However, all these methods rely on hard selection cuts, which either contaminate samples when relaxed or exclude genuine members when applied too strictly, leading to uncertain and biased classifications. We develop a flexible and reliable approach to classify disk and halo stars in galaxies by applying fuzzy set theory, which can overcome the limitations of traditional hard-cut selection methods. As a case study, we analyze one of the Milky Way/M31-like galaxies in the TNG50 catalogue. We consider multiple stellar properties as fuzzy variables and characterize their variations between disk and halo stars to construct the respective membership functions. These functions are then combined to assign each star a membership degree corresponding to its galactic component. Our fuzzy set approach provides a more realistic distinction between the disk and the halo stars. This method effectively reduces contamination and recovers genuine members that are often excluded by rigid selection criteria. The fuzzy set theory framework offers a robust alternative to conventional hard-cut methods, enabling more accurate and physically meaningful separation of stellar populations in galaxies."

    "abstract": "Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental graph mining task, but its utility is often limited by computational intractability and highly redundant output. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{$ρ$-dense aggregators}, a novel approach that succinctly captures maximal clique structure. Instead of listing all cliques, we identify a small collection of clusters with edge density at least $ρ$ that collectively contain every maximal clique. In contrast to maximal clique enumeration, we prove that for all $ρ< 1$, every graph admits a $ρ$-dense aggregator of \\emph{sub-exponential} size, $n^{O(\\log_{1/ρ}n)}$, and provide an algorithm achieving this bound. For graphs with bounded degeneracy, a typical characteristic of real-world networks, our algorithm runs in near-linear time and produces near-linear size aggregators. We also establish a matching lower bound on aggregator size, proving our results are essentially tight. In an empirical evaluation on real-world networks, we demonstrate significant practical benefits for the use of aggregators: our algorithm is consistently faster than the state-of-the-art clique enumeration algorithm, with median speedups over $6\\times$ for $ρ=0.1$ (and over $300\\times$ in an extreme case), while delivering a much more concise structural summary."

The circular restricted three-body problem is a special case of the elliptic problem-- one that does not take into account the eccentricity of the true orbits of the primaries and thus provides a dynamical model of varying accuracy depending on the true anomaly of the primaries. This paper first shows that the normal forms of the elliptic problem offer nearly identical trajectory characterization capabilities to those of the circular problem and then demonstrates the difference in fidelity by comparing the circular and elliptic normal form representations of ephemeris data for the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, methodology for including solar radiation pressure within the normal form is introduced, and the same ephemeris data is used to demonstrate the resulting increase in fidelity of the dynamical model."

Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside."

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based image restoration has achieved significant success. However, when addressing real-world degradations, model performance is limited by the quality of ground-truth images in datasets due to practical constraints in data acquisition. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that enhances existing ground truth images to provide higher-quality supervision for real-world restoration. Our framework generates perceptually enhanced ground truth images using super-resolution by incorporating adaptive frequency masks, which are learned by a conditional frequency mask generator. These masks guide the optimal fusion of frequency components from the original ground truth and its super-resolved variants, yielding enhanced ground truth images. This frequency-domain mixup preserves the semantic consistency of the original content while selectively enriching perceptual details, preventing hallucinated artifacts that could compromise fidelity. The enhanced ground truth images are used to train a lightweight output refinement network that can be seamlessly integrated with existing restoration models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the quality of restored images. We further validate the effectiveness of both supervision enhancement and output refinement through user studies. Code is available at https://github.com/dhryougit/Beyond-the-Ground-Truth."

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering."

Transitioning to exascale simulations introduces significant challenges, with traditional file input/output (I/O) inefficiencies remaining a key bottleneck. This work advances BIT1, an electrostatic PIC MC code, by improving the particle mover with OpenMP task-based parallelism, integrating the openPMD streaming API, and enabling in-memory data streaming with ADIOS2's Sustainable Staging Transport (SST) engine to enhance I/O performance, computational efficiency, and system storage utilization. We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends. The proposed hybrid BIT1 openPMD SST enhancement introduces a new paradigm for real-time scientific discovery in plasma simulations, enabling faster insights and more efficient use of exascale computing resources."

Investigating the unconventional superconductor UPt$_{3}$ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope, we observed mobile half-quantum vortices together with one quantum vortices. Cooling the material under a higher magnetic field revealed the presence of lines of magnetic contrast resembling domain walls.

Two representative magnetic field configurations, radial orientation dominated (RO) and transverse orientation dominated (TO), are implemented with strength and decay prescriptions. We found that both anisotropy and magnetic fields increase the maximum supported mass and modify the tidal deformability $Λ$, thereby imprinting measurable signatures on GW signals. For the equal mass binary ($1.2M_\\odot$-$1.2M_\\odot$), anisotropy neutron star with RO magnetic field yield more compact stars and a larger shift in $Λ$, allowing discrimination at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as low as $\\sim18$ using the O4 power spectra density.

With the expanding usage of open-source libraries, it becomes even more imperative to comprehend and address these dependency vulnerabilities. The use of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools does greatly help here as they provide a deep insight on what dependencies are used in a project, enhancing the security and integrity in the software supply chain. In order to learn how wide spread vulnerabilities are and how quickly they are being fixed, we conducted a study on over 1k open-source software projects with about 50k releases comprising several languages such as Java, Python, Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript. Our objective is to investigate the severity, persistence, and distribution of these vulnerabilities, as well as their correlation with project metrics such as team and contributors size, activity and release cycles. In order to perform such analysis, we crawled over 1k projects from github including their version history ranging from 2013 to 2023 using VODA, our SCA tool. Using our approach, we can provide information such as library versions, dependency depth, and known vulnerabilities, and how they evolved over the software development cycle. Being larger and more diverse than datasets used in earlier works and studies, ours provides better insights and generalizability of the gained results. The data collected answers several research questions about the dependency depth and the average time a vulnerability persists. Among other findings, we observed that for most programming languages, vulnerable dependencies are transitive, and a critical vulnerability persists in average for over a year before being fixed."

Within these normal forms we capture the dependence of these periodic orbits on the resonant Fourier coefficients of the dynamics on the invariant curve and, using the contraction mapping principle, obtain a suitable deformation achieving the prescribed spectral data associated with this sequence of orbits. The result can be viewed as a symplectic twist-map analogue of a length spectral nonrigidity phenomenon for Riemannian manifolds and convex billiards, and it motivates the existence problem for similar 'partially length-isospectral' deformations of strictly convex billiard tables."

    "abstract": "We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering."

This model predicts the existence of extremely low frequency electrostatic waves with real frequencies of the order of a milli Hertz (mHz) to several mHz and this range of frequencies have been reported in literature for these plasma environments.

To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures."

For a given Hamiltonian of a quantum system or a generic random matrix Hamiltonian, which can be written as a sum of two non-commutating operators, one can obtain an expression for the density of states of the Hamiltonian from the known density of states of the two component operators by assuming that these operators are mutually free and by using the free additive convolution. In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder."

Nevertheless, existing methods for extracting deep features from RGB videos face challenges such as information redundancy, susceptibility to noise and high storage costs. To address these issues and fully harness the useful information in videos, we propose a novel heatmap pooling network (HP-Net) for action recognition from videos, which extracts information-rich, robust and concise pooled features of the human body in videos through a feedback pooling module. The extracted pooled features demonstrate obvious performance advantages over the previously obtained pose data and heatmap features from videos. In addition, we design a spatial-motion co-learning module and a text refinement modulation module to integrate the extracted pooled features with other multimodal data, enabling more robust action recognition. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks namely NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Toyota-Smarthome and UAV-Human consistently verify the effectiveness of our HP-Net, which outperforms the existing human action recognition methods.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) constructs classifiers from datasets in which only a subset of observations is labelled, a situation that naturally arises because obtaining labels often requires expert judgement or costly manual effort. This motivates methods that integrate labelled and unlabelled data within a learning framework. Most SSL approaches assume that label absence is harmless, typically treated as missing completely at random or ignored, but in practice, the missingness process can be informative, as the chances of an observation being unlabelled may depend on the ambiguity of its feature vector. In such cases, the missingness indicators themselves provide additional information that, if properly modelled, may improve estimation efficiency. The \\textbf{SSLfmm} package for R is designed to capture this behaviour by estimating the Bayes' classifier under a finite mixture model in which each component corresponding to a class follows a multivariate normal distribution. It incorporates a mixed-missingness mechanism that combines a missing completely at random (MCR) component with a (non-ignorable) missing at random (MAR) component, the latter modelling the probability of label missingness as a logistic function of the entropy based on the features. Parameters are estimated via an Expectation--Conditional Maximisation algorithm. In the two-class Gaussian setting with arbitrary covariance matrices, the resulting classifier trained on partially labelled data may, in some cases, achieve a lower misclassification rate than the supervised version in the case where all the labels are known. The package includes a practical tool for modelling and illustrates its performance through simulated examples."

In this study, we present a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset collected from trained musicians as they imagined and listened to musical and poetic stimuli. We show that both imagined and perceived brain responses contain consistent, condition-specific information. Using a sliding-window ridge regression model, we first mapped imagined responses to listened responses at the single-subject level, but found limited generalization across subjects. At the group level, we developed an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network with a subject-specific calibration layer that produced stable and generalizable mappings. The CNN consistently outperformed the null model, yielding significantly higher correlations between predicted and true listened responses for nearly all held-out subjects. Our findings demonstrate that imagined neural activity can be transformed into perception-like responses, providing a foundation for future brain-computer interface applications involving imagined speech and music."

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Radiomics of knee MRI requires robust, anatomically meaningful regions of interest (ROIs) that jointly capture cartilage and subchondral bone. Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features. Conclusions: LM-CartSeg yields automatic, QCd ROIs and radiomic features that carry discriminative information beyond simple morphometry, providing a practical foundation for multi-centre knee OA radiomics studies."

However, existing methods often struggle with the noise inherent in web-collected data and the complexity of unstructured long medical texts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel VLP framework integrating a Multi-Agent data GENeration (MAGEN) system and Ontology-based Multi-Aspect Knowledge-Enhanced (O-MAKE) pretraining. First, MAGEN enhances data quality by synthesizing knowledge-enriched descriptions via a foundation model-assisted captioning and retrieval-based verification pipeline. Second, O-MAKE addresses the difficulty of learning from long, unstructured texts by decomposing them into distinct knowledge aspects. This facilitates fine-grained alignment at both global and patch levels, while explicitly modeling medical concept relationships through ontology-guided mechanisms. We validate our framework in the field of dermatology, where comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on disease classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across eight datasets. Our code and the augmented dataset Derm1M-AgentAug, comprising over 400k skin-image-text pairs, will be released at https://github.com/SiyuanYan1/Derm1M."

Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies."

Together with existing ground-based NIR spectroscopy and ALMA observations, we investigate the correlations between X-ray emission (the X-ray luminosity $L_{\\rm X}$ and the optical/UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $α_{\\rm OX}$) and various quasar properties (rest-UV luminosity $L_{\\mathrm{2500\\ \\mathring{A}}}$, bolometric luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}$, C IV blueshift, and infrared luminosity $L_{\\rm IR}$). We find most $z>6.5$ quasars follow a similar $α_{\\rm OX}-L_{\\mathrm{2500\\ \\mathring{A}}}$ relation as $z\\sim1-6$ quasars, but also display a large scatter. We find a potential correlation between $α_{\\rm OX}$ and the C IV blueshift, suggesting a soft optical/UV-to-X-ray SED shape is frequently associated with fast disk winds. Furthermore, we analyze the X-ray spectrum of 11 quasars at $z>6.5$ with Chandra detection, and find the best-fit photon index $Γ$ is $2.41\\pm0.27$, which is likely driven by high accretion rates of $z>6.5$ quasars. In addition, we find there are no significant correlations between either $L_{\\rm X}$ and $L_{\\rm IR}$, nor $L_{\\rm bol}$ and $L_{\\rm IR}$, suggesting no strong correlations between quasar luminosity and star formation luminosity for the most luminous quasars at $z>6.5$."

Under the standard LiNGAM assumptions of linearity, acyclicity, and exogeneity, we prove that the Gaussianity of the forward-model noise is equivalent to the independence between the regressor and residual in the reverse model. This theoretical insight allows us to replace fragile and sample-sensitive Gaussianity tests with robust kernel-based independence tests. Experimental results validate the equivalence and demonstrate that GaussDetect-LiNGAM maintains high consistency across diverse noise types and sample sizes, while reducing the number of tests per decision (TPD). Our method enhances both the efficiency and practical applicability of causal inference, making LiNGAM more accessible and reliable in real-world scenarios."

While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project."

However, applying them to arbitrary functions (especially internal functions) \\textit{at scale} remains challenging due to the requirement of sophisticated contextual information, such as specification, dependencies, and usage examples. State-of-the-art methods heavily rely on static or incomplete context provisioning, causing failure of generating functional harnesses. Furthermore, LLMs tend to exploit harness validation metrics, producing plausible yet logically useless code. % Therefore, harness generation across large and diverse projects continues to face challenges in reliable compilation, robust code retrieval, and comprehensive validation. To address these challenges, we present HarnessAgent, a tool-augmented agentic framework that achieves fully automated, scalable harness construction over hundreds of OSS-Fuzz targets. HarnessAgent introduces three key innovations: 1) a rule-based strategy to identify and minimize various compilation errors; 2) a hybrid tool pool for precise and robust symbol source code retrieval; and 3) an enhanced harness validation pipeline that detects fake definitions. We evaluate HarnessAgent on 243 target functions from OSS-Fuzz projects (65 C projects and 178 C++ projects). It improves the three-shot success rate by approximately 20\\% compared to state-of-the-art techniques, reaching 87\\% for C and 81\\% for C++. Our one-hour fuzzing results show that more than 75\\% of the harnesses generated by HarnessAgent increase the target function coverage, surpassing the baselines by over 10\\%.

However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on \"how\" objects can be used while neglecting the \"what\" and \"where\" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant).

We compare standard next-token prediction to two explicit world-modeling strategies -- (i) state-prediction pretraining and (ii) a joint state-prediction + next-token objective -- and assess task performance after Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied as post-training. We evaluate the representation quality with linear probes and causal interventions. We find that explicit world-modeling yields more linearly decodable and causally steerable state representations. More importantly, we find that improved state representations lead to higher gains for GRPO, especially on harder cube states. Our results indicate that sharpening state representations can improve the effectiveness of post-training for sequence-planning tasks."

    "abstract": "The use of differential phase contrast (DPC) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has shown much promise for directly investigating the functional properties of a material system, leveraging the natural coupling between the electron probe and atomic-scale electric fields to map the electrostatic configuration within a sample. However, the high sensitivity of these measurements makes them particularly vulnerable to variations in both sample properties and the configuration of the instrument, stressing the need for robust methodologies to ensure more accurate analyses. In this work, the influence of key instrumental parameters - probe convergence angle, defocus and two-fold astigmatism - on atomic-resolution segmented-detector DPC-STEM measurements is evaluated through extensive image simulations. Results show that the limit of interpretability for a 21 mrad defocused probe is found at a magnitude of 4 nm, where electrostatic field magnitude can be underestimated by about 16 % in overfocus and just above 10 % in underfocus. Equivalent results for a 30 mrad probe demonstrate underestimated values around 30 % at overfocus and 20 % for underfocus, at a lower interpretability limit of 3 nm. Two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation dependent variations that surpass 40 % for magnitudes below 3 nm, but a reduction in sensitivity to the aberration is observed when oriented along detector-segment edges. Overall, the analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based method and underscores the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM based STEM imaging."

Despite significant advances in automation for structure solution, the refinement stage still depends heavily on expert intervention and subjective judgment, limiting accessibility and scalability. Herein, we introduce RefrActor, an end-to-end deep learning framework that enables crystal structure determination directly from HKL data. By coupling a physics-informed reciprocal-space encoder (ReciEncoder) with a symmetry-aware diffusion-based generator (StruDiffuser), RefrActor produces fully refined atomic models without requiring initial structural guesses or manual input. Comprehensive evaluations on the GenRef-10k benchmark demonstrates that RefrActor achieves low R1-factors across diverse systems, including low-symmetry, light-atom, and heavy-atom crystals. Case studies further confirm that RefrActor can correctly resolve hydrogen positions, elemental assignments, and moderate disorder. This work establishes a new data-driven paradigm for autonomous crystallographic analysis, offering a foundation for fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure determination."

    "abstract": "The detection of weak, spatially distributed anomalies in volumetric medical imaging remains a major challenge. The subtle, non-adjacent nature of early disease signals is often lost due to suboptimal architectural inductive biases: 2D/3D CNNs impose strong locality, while ViTs diffuse unconstrained global attention. This conflict leaves the optimal inductive structure for robust, sparse volumetric pattern recognition unresolved. This study presents a controlled comparison of sixteen modern deep learning architectures spanning 2D/3D convolutional, hybrid, and volumetric transformer families for subclinical keratoconus (SKC) detection from 3D anterior segment OCT volumes. We demonstrate that hierarchical attention models offer a superior and more parameter-efficient inductive bias, surpassing the performance of both 2D and 3D CNNs and ViTs. Our results show 21-23% higher sensitivity and specificity in the sparse anomaly (subclinical) regime. Mechanistic analyses reveal that this advantage stems from precise spatial scale alignment: hierarchical windowing produces effective receptive fields matched to the intermediate, multi-slice extent of subclinical abnormalities. This avoids excessive CNN locality and diffuse global attention. Attention-distance measurements confirm a key insight into architectural adaptation: the required spatial integration length shifts significantly based on the signal strength, with subclinical cases necessitating longer integration compared to both healthy and manifest disease states. Representational similarity and auxiliary age/sex prediction tasks further support the generalizability of these inductive principles. The findings provide design guidance for future volumetric anomaly detection systems, establishing hierarchical attention as a principled and effective approach for early pathological change analysis in 3D medical imaging."

    "abstract": "In this work, we systematically investigate the optical feedback dynamics of terahertz (THz) frequency combs generated from quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) using the effective semiconductor Maxwell-Bloch equations (ESMBEs). Starting from a free-running comb state at low bias (1.3Ith), we identify clear bifurcation routes as the external feedback is increased. In the weak feedback regime (C<1), the frequency comb operation remains stable; as feedback increases to the moderate feedback regime (1<C<2.4), the system transitions through frequency splitting into period-one (P1) oscillations around each comb, followed by higher-order bifurcations (P2, P4, P8). Within the range 2.4<C<13.86, only combs with P1 states are observed, with the split frequency increasing continuously with feedback strength. In the strong feedback regime (C>13.86), complex feedback dynamics re-emerged but with significantly reduced complexity compared with the weak feedback regime. More interestingly, we show that optical feedback can induce chaotic THz emission at higher bias current conditions (>1.6Ith), when the free-running laser output (C=0) is originally a stable frequency comb. The resulting chaotic dynamics, characterized by broadband spectra and large positive Lyapunov exponents, are shown to depend strongly on the linewidth enhancement factor. Although THz QCLs widely considered as ultrastable under external perturbations, this work provides the first detailed report of chaotic dynamics and routes to chaos in THz QCLs under optical feedback. These findings not only deepen the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in THz QCLs but also open new possibilities for exploiting applications of chaotic light in THz sensing, imaging and secure communications."

In this work, we introduce the Idea-Gated Transformer, a novel architecture that separates semantic planning from syntactic generation. We introduce an auxiliary ``Idea Head'' trained to predict the bag-of-words distribution for a future context window, creating a latent ``Concept Vector'' that actively gates the main vocabulary during generation. We propose a differentiable gating mechanism that suppresses semantically irrelevant tokens, effectively pruning the search space in real-time. Experiments on WikiText-103 demonstrate that while the Idea-Gated model achieves comparable validation perplexity to a standard GPT-2 baseline, it exhibits significantly superior Domain Retention. Qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that the gating mechanism successfully locks generation into specific semantic clusters (e.g., Finance, Science) and resists associative drift, offering a parameter-efficient path toward more controllable language modeling."

The emergence of generative AI encyclopedias, such as Grokipedia, possibly presents another potential shift in epistemic evolution. This study investigates whether AI- and human-curated encyclopedias rely on the same foundations of authority. We conducted a multi-scale comparative analysis of the citation networks from 72 matched article pairs, which cite a total of almost 60,000 sources. Using an 8-category epistemic classification, we mapped the \"epistemic profiles\" of the articles on each platform. Our findings reveal several quantitative and qualitative differences in how knowledge is sourced and encyclopedia claims are epistemologically justified. Grokipedia replaces Wikipedia's heavy reliance on peer-reviewed \"Academic & Scholarly\" work with a notable increase in \"User-generated\" and \"Civic organization\" sources. Comparative network analyses further show that Grokipedia employs very different epistemological profiles when sourcing leisure topics (such as Sports and Entertainment) and more societal sensitive civic topics (such as Politics & Conflicts, Geographical Entities, and General Knowledge & Society). Finally, we find a \"scaling-law for AI-generated knowledge sourcing\" that shows a linear relationship between article length and citation density, which is distinct from collective human reference sourcing. We conclude that this first implementation of an LLM-based encyclopedia does not merely automate knowledge production but restructures it. Given the notable changes and the important role of encyclopedias, we suggest the continuation and deepening of algorithm audits, such as the one presented here, in order to understand the ongoing epistemological shifts."

In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH)."

As such, our model is able to perform exact and fast volume rendering using both rasterization and ray-tracing. We introduce a new rasterization method that achieves faster rendering speeds than all prior radiance field representations (assuming an equivalent number of primitives and resolution) across a variety of platforms. Optimizing the positions of Delaunay vertices introduces topological discontinuities (edge flips). To solve this, we use a Zip-NeRF-style backbone which allows us to express a smoothly varying field even when the topology changes. Our rendering method exactly evaluates the volume rendering equation and enables high quality, real-time view synthesis on standard consumer hardware. Our tetrahedral meshes also lend themselves to a variety of exciting applications including fisheye lens distortion, physics-based simulation, editing, and mesh extraction."

    "abstract": "Scatter in distance indicators introduces two conceptually distinct systematic biases when reconstructing peculiar velocity fields from redshifts and distances. The first is distance Malmquist bias (dMB) that affects individual distance estimates and can in principle be approximately corrected. The second is velocity Malmquist bias (vMB) that arises when constructing continuous velocity fields from scattered distance measurements: random scatter places galaxies at noisy spatial positions, introducing spurious velocity gradients that persist even when distances are corrected for dMB. Considering the Tully-Fisher relation as a concrete example, both inverse and forward formulations yield unbiased individual peculiar velocities for galaxies with the same true distance (the forward relation requires a selection-dependent correction), but neither eliminates vMB when galaxies are placed at their inferred distances. We develop a modified Wiener filter that properly encodes correlations between directly observed distance $d$ and true distance $r$ through the conditional probability $P(r|d)$, accounting for the distribution of true distances sampled by galaxies at observed distance $d$. Nonetheless, this modified filter yields suppressed amplitude estimates. Since machine learning autoencoders converge to the Wiener filter for Gaussian fields, they are unlikely to significantly improve velocity field estimation. We therefore argue that optimal reconstruction places galaxies at their observed redshifts rather than inferred distances; an approach effective when distance errors exceed $σ_v/H_0$, a condition satisfied for most galaxies in typical surveys beyond the nearby volume."

These embedded minor relations appear naturally for intrinsically embedded objects, such as knot diagrams and surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Handling the extra topological constraints of the embeddings requires careful analysis and extensions of classical methods for the more constrained embedded minor relations. We prove that the embedded version of immersion induces a well-quasi-order on bounded carving-width plane graphs by exhibiting particularly well-structured tree-decompositions and leveraging a classical argument on well-quasi-orders on forests. We deduce that the embedded graph minor relation defines a well-quasi-order on plane graphs via their directed medial graphs, when their branch-width is bounded. We conclude that the embedded graph minor relation is a well-quasi-order on all plane graphs, using classical grids theorems in the unbounded branch-width case."

This decomposition enables both the forward application and the backward inversion to be accomplished with quasi-linear complexity. The fast inversion can serve as a high-accuracy direct solver or as an efficient preconditioner. Additionally, we provide an error bound for the approximation under specific sample distributions. Numerical results are presented to verify the relevant theoretical properties and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods."

This work provides a comprehensive treatment of Gaussian, quadratic cost OT and inner product GW (IGW) alignment, closing several gaps in the literature to broaden applicability. First, we treat the open problem of IGW alignment between uncentered Gaussians on separable Hilbert spaces by giving a closed-form expression up to a quadratic optimization over unitary operators, for which we derive tight analytic upper and lower bounds. If at least one Gaussian measure is centered, the solution reduces to a fully closed-form expression, which we further extend to an analytic solution for the IGW barycenter between centered Gaussians. We also present a reduction of Gaussian multimarginal OT with pairwise quadratic costs to a tractable optimization problem and provide an efficient algorithm to solve it using a rank-deficiency constraint. To demonstrate utility, we apply our results to knowledge distillation and heterogeneous clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets."

Although Pfund~$α$ (H~\\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$α$ (H~\\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $μm$ and H~\\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $μm$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($<10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime."

DRAGONS is a new full polarization survey of the Northern sky from 350 to 1030 MHz covering declinations -20° < $δ$ < 90° and a component of GMIMS. The first moment of the Faraday depth spectra produced from DRAGONS above 500 MHz reveals large-angular-scale Faraday depth structures with signs that alternate only once in the Southern Galactic hemisphere and twice in the Northern hemisphere, patterns shared by other Faraday rotation datasets. DRAGONS is the first survey to achieve high Faraday depth resolution while maintaining sensitivity to broad Faraday depth structures, enabling the first use of Galactic longitude-Faraday depth plots. These plots reveal Faraday-complex structures across the sky, indicating a slab-like scenario in which emission and Faraday rotation are mixed. This complexity is overlaid on the same large-scale Faraday depth patterns that appear in the first moment map. We model these patterns as a magnetic reversal slicing through the disk on a diagonal and passing above the Sun in Galactic coordinates. We describe this reversal as a plane with a normal vector parallel to the line directed along ($\\ell$, b) = (168.5°, -60°) and estimate its distance to be between 0.25 and 0.55 kpc.

Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as the recently proposed GaussMark, typically rely on small modifications to model weights, which can yield signals detectable to those equipped with a secret key, but achieving detection power comparable to inference-time watermarks generally requires weight perturbations that noticeably reduce generation quality. We introduce MarkTune, a theoretically principled, on-policy fine-tuning framework that treats the GaussMark signal as a reward while simultaneously regularizing against degradation in text quality. We derive MarkTune as an improvement on GaussMark and demonstrate that MarkTune consistently improves the quality-detectability trade-off over GaussMark by steering finer-grained, watermark-aware weight updates within the model's representation space while preserving generation quality. Empirically, we show that MarkTune pushes the quality-detectability frontier of GaussMark close to that of inference-time watermarking, remains robust to paraphrasing and fine-tuning attacks, and exhibits strong generalization: a model fine-tuned on one dataset retains substantial watermark detection power on unseen datasets. Together, these results establish MarkTune as a general strategy for embedding robust, high-quality watermarks into open-weight LMs."

    "abstract": "Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \\ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z>6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)."

By integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a standardized tool interface, diverse agent architectures can be connected to and evaluated against the benchmark without implementation-specific modifications. A single-agent implementation demonstrates the benchmark's applicability, establishing quantitative metrics for comparison of LLM-based planning and execution approaches."

    "abstract": "Language models depend on massive text corpora that are often filtered for quality, a process that can unintentionally exclude non-standard linguistic varieties, reduce model robustness and reinforce representational biases. In this paper, we argue that language models should aim to capture the full spectrum of language variation (dialectal, historical, informal, etc.) rather than relying solely on standardized text. Focusing on Basque, a morphologically rich and low-resource language, we construct new corpora combining standard, social media, and historical sources, and pre-train the BERnaT family of encoder-only models in three configurations: standard, diverse, and combined. We further propose an evaluation framework that separates Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks into standard and diverse subsets to assess linguistic generalization. Results show that models trained on both standard and diverse data consistently outperform those trained on standard corpora, improving performance across all task types without compromising standard benchmark accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of linguistic diversity in building inclusive, generalizable language models."

Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries."

A key application is in the bosonic cat code, where we obtain explicit estimates in the trace norm for the speed of convergence. These estimates sharpen existing perturbative bounds at both short and long times, offering new analytic tools for assessing stability and error suppression in bosonic quantum information processing. For example, we improve the strong exponential convergence of the (shifted) $2$-photon dissipation to its fixed point to the uniform topology."

The international physics community, particularly in Europe and the United States, absorbed a substantial influx of specialists in nuclear, high-energy, and accelerator physics, including both seasoned scientists and engineers as well as promising graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Many of these emigre researchers went on to assume leadership positions, drive major experimental and theoretical initiatives, and achieve scientific distinction that equaled or even surpassed their accomplishments at home. In this article we explore the defining features of this post Cold War scientific diaspora, assess its impact on Russia research infrastructure and capabilities, and evaluate its enduring contributions to global particle physics collaborations and discoveries."

Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $ν= 1$, from both $ν= 2/3$ and $ν= 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems."

We introduce a novel greedy framework for the optimal selection of indirect measurements in the operator codomain, specifically tailored to inverse problems. Our approach employs a two-step scheme combining kernel-based interpolation and extrapolation. Within this framework, greedy schemes can be residual-based, where points are selected according to the current approximation error for a specific target function, or error-based, where points are chosen using a priori error indicators independent of the residual. For the latter, we derive explicit error bounds that quantify the propagation of approximation errors through both interpolation and extrapolation. Numerical applications to solar hard X-ray imaging demonstrate that the proposed greedy sampling strategy achieves high-quality reconstructions using only a few available measurements."

    "abstract": "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is crucial for observing material's structural and morphological evolution at Angstrom scales, but the electron beam can alter these processes. Devices such as CMOS-based direct-electron detectors operating in electron-counting mode can be utilized to substantially reduce the electron dosage. However, the resulting images often lead to low signal-to-noise ratio, which requires frame integration that sacrifices temporal resolution. Several machine learning (ML) models have been recently developed to successfully denoise HRTEM images. Yet, these models are often computationally expensive and their inference speeds on GPUs are outpaced by the imaging speed of advanced detectors, precluding in situ analysis. Furthermore, the performance of these denoising models on datasets with imaging conditions that deviate from the training datasets have not been evaluated. To mitigate these gaps, we propose a new self-supervised ML denoising pipeline specifically designed for time-series HRTEM images. This pipeline integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre-processing and post-processing steps including drift correction and low-pass filtering. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms various other ML and non-ML denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features. Additionally, the model is drastically faster than U-Net-based ML models and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image, rendering it suitable for application in in-situ HRTEM experiments."

    "abstract": "Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific information is completely discarded. This is a fundamental consequence of information bottleneck optimization: models trained on single domains (e.g., medical images) learn to rely solely on class-specific features while discarding domain features, leading to catastrophic failure when detecting out-of-domain samples (e.g., achieving only 53% FPR@95 on MNIST). We extend our analysis using Fano's inequality to quantify partial collapse in practical scenarios. To validate our theory, we introduce Domain Bench, a benchmark of single-domain datasets, and demonstrate that preserving I(x_d; z) > 0 through domain filtering (using pretrained representations) resolves the failure mode. While domain filtering itself is conceptually straightforward, its effectiveness provides strong empirical evidence for our information-theoretic framework. Our work explains a puzzling empirical phenomenon, reveals fundamental limitations of supervised learning in narrow domains, and has broader implications for transfer learning and when to fine-tune versus freeze pretrained models."

First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory corroborate our findings, providing a theoretical basis for our experimental observations.

Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equations, yielding exact analytic solutions for a dense discrete set of temperatures and numerical solutions in all other cases. Any target temperature can be approximated with arbitrary precision, with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation."

A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple. Aigner gave a series of weaker, related conjectures which were confirmed to be true by Lee, Li, Rabideau, and Schiffler using techniques from the theory of cluster algebras.

Recent approaches use per-pixel 3D Gaussian Splatting for reconstruction, followed by a 2D-to-3D feature lifting stage for scene understanding. However, they generate excessive redundant Gaussians, causing high memory overhead and sub-optimal multi-view feature aggregation, leading to degraded novel view synthesis and scene understanding performance. We propose C3G, a novel feed-forward framework that estimates compact 3D Gaussians only at essential spatial locations, minimizing redundancy while enabling effective feature lifting. We introduce learnable tokens that aggregate multi-view features through self-attention to guide Gaussian generation, ensuring each Gaussian integrates relevant visual features across views. We then exploit the learned attention patterns for Gaussian decoding to efficiently lift features. Extensive experiments on pose-free novel view synthesis, 3D open-vocabulary segmentation, and view-invariant feature aggregation demonstrate our approach's effectiveness. Results show that a compact yet geometrically meaningful representation is sufficient for high-quality scene reconstruction and understanding, achieving superior memory efficiency and feature fidelity compared to existing methods."

Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup.

Concretely, we model the compact body as a spherical shell, whose finite size regulates short-distance divergences in four dimensions and whose tidal responses are described by higher-dimensional operators. As an application, we consider scalar perturbations and derive new results for scalar Love numbers through ${\\cal O} (G^9)$ for Schwarzschild black holes and for generic compact bodies.

Their properties and formation mechanisms seem to be tightly linked to the evolution of the host galaxy, with potentially different formation channels for late- and early-type galaxies (respectively, LTGs and ETGs). While most observations target ETGs, here we focus on the NSC in M 74 (NGC 628), a relatively massive, gas-rich and star-forming spiral galaxy, part of the PHANGS survey. We analyzed the central arcmin of the PHANGS-MUSE mosaic, in which the NSC is not spatially resolved. We performed a two-dimensional spectro-photometric decomposition of the MUSE cube, employing a modified version of the C2D code, to disentangle the NSC from the host galaxy. Here we used three components: a bulge, a disk and a NSC approximated to the point spread function (PSF), obtaining three data cubes, one for each component. This allowed us to extract separately the age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] abundance for the NSC and the host galaxy. Our results show a very old and metal-poor NSC, in contrast to the surrounding regions. While similar properties were found in NSCs hosted by galaxies of different masses and/or morphological types from M 74, they are somewhat unexpected for a relatively massive star-forming spiral galaxy. The spatially resolved stellar populations of the host galaxy display much younger (light-weighted) ages and higher metallicities, especially in the central region (${\\sim}500$ pc) surrounding the NSC. This suggests that this NSC formed a long time ago, and evolved passively until today, without any further growth. Our results show that the NSC was not involved in the active recent star-formation history of its host galaxy."

In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of dynamic multiplex networks, corresponding to graphs where multiple types of edges evolve over time, a key inferential task is to determine whether the layers associated with different edge types differ in their connectivity. In this work, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework, under a latent space network model, for assessing whether the layers share a common latent representation. The method we propose extends previous literature related to the problem of pairwise testing for random graphs and enables global testing of differences between layers in multiplex graphs. While we introduce the method as a test for differences between layers, it can easily be adapted to test for differences between time points. We construct a test statistic based on a spectral embedding of an unfolded representation of the graph adjacency matrices and demonstrate its ability to detect differences across layers in the asymptotic regime where the number of nodes in each graph tends to infinity. The finite-sample properties of the test are empirically demonstrated by assessing its performance on both simulated data and a biological dataset describing the neural activity of larval Drosophila."

Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective.

To address it, we present a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM), which seamlessly integrates the blur formation process into diffusion for image deblurring. Observing that motion blur stems from continuous exposure, BlurDM implicitly models the blur formation process through a dual-diffusion forward scheme, diffusing both noise and blur onto a sharp image. During the reverse generation process, we derive a dual denoising and deblurring formulation, enabling BlurDM to recover the sharp image by simultaneously denoising and deblurring, given pure Gaussian noise conditioned on the blurred image as input. Additionally, to efficiently integrate BlurDM into deblurring networks, we perform BlurDM in the latent space, forming a flexible prior generation network for deblurring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlurDM significantly and consistently enhances existing deblurring methods on four benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Finite abstractions are discrete approximations of dynamical systems, such that the set of abstraction trajectories contains, in a formal sense, all system trajectories. There is a consensus that abstractions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: for the same ``accuracy\" (how closely the abstraction represents the system), the abstraction size scales poorly with system dimensions. And, yet, after decades of research on abstractions, there are no formal results concerning their accuracy-size tradeoff. In this work, we derive a statistical, quantitative theory of abstractions' accuracy-size tradeoff and uncover fundamental limits on their scalability, through rate-distortion theory -- the branch of information theory studying lossy compression. Abstractions are viewed as encoder-decoder pairs, encoding trajectories of dynamical systems in a higher-dimensional ambient space. Rate represents abstraction size, while distortion describes abstraction accuracy, defined as the spatial average deviation between abstract trajectories and system ones. We obtain a fundamental lower bound on the minimum abstraction distortion, given the system dynamics and a threshold on abstraction size. The bound depends on the complexity of the dynamics, through generalized entropy. We demonstrate the bound's tightness on certain dynamical systems. Finally, we showcase how the developed theory can be employed to construct optimal abstractions, in terms of the size-accuracy tradeoff, through an example on a chaotic system."

Rather than enumerating candidate trees or relying on heuristic impurity or entropy measures, we encode the entire space of bounded-depth decision trees symbolically in SAT formulas. We propose a symbolic method for active learning of decision trees, in which approximate model counting is used to estimate the reduction of the hypothesis space caused by each potential query, enabling near-optimal query selection without full model enumeration. The resulting learner incrementally strengthens a CNF representation based on observed query outcomes, and approximate model counter ApproxMC is invoked to quantify the remaining version space in a sound and scalable manner. Additionally, when ApproxMC stagnates, a functional equivalence check is performed to verify that all remaining hypotheses are functionally identical. Experiments on decision trees show that the method reliably converges to the correct model using only a handful of queries, while retaining a rigorous SAT-based foundation suitable for formal analysis and verification."

While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for improving temporal reasoning, existing approaches are often confined to limited task types and data, restricting their generalization across diverse temporal understanding scenarios. To address this challenge, we present TempR1, a temporal-aware multi-task reinforcement learning framework that systematically strengthens MLLMs' temporal comprehension. We curate a multi-task corpus that exposes the model to diverse temporal structures and semantics, and build upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to achieve stable and effective cross-task optimization. Specifically, we categorize temporal tasks into three correspondence types between predicted intervals and ground-truth instances, and design tailored localization rewards for each, enabling TempR1 to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies and adapt to different temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempR1 attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, its joint optimization over complementary tasks yields a strong synergistic effect, enhancing both generalization and single-task performance, establishing a scalable and principled paradigm for temporal reasoning in MLLMs."

Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\\, \\mathrm{k_B\\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\\, \\mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock."

    "abstract": "We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-Márki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety. We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations."

The algorithm's performance is evaluated by analyzing dijet data events from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ and $13.6$ TeV during Run 2 and Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider. Two methods are used to obtain distributions from quark- or gluon-initiated jets in data: a matrix method fully based on Monte Carlo simulation and a new approach named `jet topics' which has less dependence on the modelling of the physics process under study. The quark and gluon identification efficiencies measured in data for the 50% quark-identification-efficiency working point vary from the simulated ones for quark-initiated (gluon-initiated) jets by factors of 0.88-1.30 (0.61-1.05) with uncertainties of 10%-70% (10%-95%). The uncertainties estimated with the jet topics method are smaller than those estimated with the matrix method, with up to 20% less systematic uncertainty in some phase-space regions. The advances in jet identification reported here provide a robust tool for precision Standard Model measurements and searches for new physics at the LHC."

Therefore, it is of interest to terminate the optimization algorithm as soon as the underlying data science task is accomplished. We consider FISTA for solving two binary classification problems: the ellipsoid separation problem (ESP), and the soft-margin support-vector machine (SVM). For the ESP, we cast the dual second-order cone program into a form amenable to FISTA and show that the FISTA residual converges to the infimal displacement vector of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, that directly encodes a separating hyperplane. We further derive a data-dependent iteration upper bound scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(1/δ_{\\mathcal{A}}^2)$, where $δ_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is the minimal perturbation that destroys separability. For the SVM, we propose a strongly-concave perturbed dual that admits efficient FISTA updates under a linear time projection scheme, and with our parameter choices, the objective has small condition number, enabling rapid convergence. We prove that, under a reasonable data model, early-stopped iterates identify well-classified points and yield a hyperplane that exactly separates them, where the accuracy required of the dual iterate is governed by geometric properties of the data. In particular, the proposed early-stopping criteria diminish the need for hard-to-select tolerance-based stopping conditions. Our numerical experiments on ESP instances derived from MNIST data and on soft-margin SVM benchmarks indicate competitive runtimes and substantial speedups from stopping early."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), while offering significant advantages as a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, faces substantial challenges when deployed on low-cost edge devices with tight memory constraints. Expert offloading mitigates this issue by storing expert parameters in CPU memory and caching a subset of popular experts in GPU memory. Although this approach improves GPU memory utilization by caching only the likely-used experts, the GPU memory reserved for expert caching is underutilized compared with dense LLMs. This paper presents OD-MoE, a distributed MoE inference framework that obviates the need for expert caches via fully on-demand expert loading. OD-MoE is built upon two key mechanisms: 1) parallelizing expert loading and expert computation across distributed edge nodes, and 2) an ultra-accurate emulative predictor that forecasts expert activations multiple layers ahead while expert computation is ongoing. With these innovations, OD-MoE dynamically loads each target expert to one of the distributed nodes just-in-time before its activation and promptly evicts it afterward, freeing GPU memory for subsequent experts. We comprehensively benchmark OD-MoE against state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems on a ten-node testbed. Experimental results show that: 1) OD-MoE achieves 99.94% expert activation prediction accuracy, substantially surpassing all existing methods; and 2) OD-MoE delivers approximately 75% of the decoding speed of a fully GPU-cached MoE deployment while using only 1/3 of the GPU memory. More importantly, by eliminating the need for expert caches, OD-MoE enables MoE inference on edge nodes with less-than-1GB GPU memory, paving the way for practical MoE deployment of low-cost IoT devices at the edge in the LLM era."

In this work, we present the experimental demonstration of an information-theoretically secure and efficient electronic voting protocol that, crucially, does not rely on election authorities, leveraging the unique properties of quantum states. Our experiment is based on a high-performance source of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and realizes a proof-of-principle implementation of the protocol in two scenarios: a configuration with four voters and two candidates employing privacy enhancement techniques and an election scenario supporting up to eight voters and sixteen candidates.

While GA-history sampling can reduce training loss quickly and yields strong in-sample fits to the target surface, learning-curve diagnostics show a widening train--validation gap across generations, indicating substantial overfitting induced by the concentrated and less diverse dataset. In contrast, a broad, space-filling dataset generated via Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) achieves nearly comparable calibration accuracy while delivering markedly better out-of-sample stability across held-out surfaces. These results suggest that apparent improvements from co-evolutionary data generation largely reflect target-specific specialization rather than a more reliable global inverse mapping, and that maintaining dataset diversity is critical for robust amortized calibration."

Current methods predominantly focus on generating one modality given another as the condition or integrating either of them with other modalities such as text and audio. Unifying 2D videos and 3D motions for simultaneous optimization and generation remains largely unexplored, presenting significant challenges due to their substantial structural and distributional differences. Inspired by the LLM's ability to unify different modalities, our method models videos and 3D motions as a unified tokens sequence, utilizing separate embedding layers to mitigate distribution gaps. Additionally, we devise a sequence modeling strategy that integrates two distinct tasks within a single framework, proving the effectiveness of unified modeling. Moreover, to efficiently align with visual tokens and preserve 3D spatial information, we design a novel 3D motion tokenizer with a temporal expansion strategy, using a single VQ-VAE to produce quantized motion tokens. It features multiple expert decoders that handle body shapes, translation, global orientation, and body poses for reliable 3D motion reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method simultaneously generates corresponding videos and motions while performing accurate motion capture. This work taps into the capacity of LLMs to fuse diverse data types, paving the way for integrating human-centric information into existing models and potentially enabling multimodal, controllable joint modeling of humans, objects, and scenes."

In this paper, we present FRESCO, which integrates intra-frame correspondence with inter-frame correspondence to formulate a more robust spatial-temporal constraint. This enhancement ensures a consistent transformation of semantically similar content between frames. Our method goes beyond attention guidance to explicitly optimize features, achieving high spatial-temporal consistency with the input video, significantly enhancing the visual coherence of manipulated videos. We verify FRESCO adaptations on two zero-shot tasks of video-to-video translation and text-guided video editing.

Early research on generative AI shows larger productivity gains for less-skilled than for high-skilled workers. Whether AI ultimately acts as an equalizer or an amplifier of human cognitive differences is especially crucial for education systems, which must decide whether -- and how -- to allow students to use AI in coursework and exams. This decision is urgent because employers value workers who can leverage AI effectively rather than operate independently of it."

However, their definition through tools from algebraic topology without a clear probabilistic interpretation detaches them from commonly used theoretical frameworks in those areas. In this work we introduce a framework that explains fuzzy simplicial sets as marginals of probability measures on simplicial sets. In particular, this perspective shows that the fuzzy weights of UMAP arise from a generative model that samples Vietoris-Rips filtrations at random scales, yielding cumulative distribution functions of pairwise distances. More generally, the framework connects fuzzy simplicial sets to probabilistic models on the face poset, clarifies the relation between Kullback-Leibler divergence and fuzzy cross-entropy in this setting, and recovers standard t-norms and t-conorms via Boolean operations on the underlying simplicial sets. We then show how new embedding methods may be derived from this framework and illustrate this on an example where we generalize UMAP using Čech filtrations with triplet sampling. In summary, this probabilistic viewpoint provides a unified probabilistic theoretical foundation for fuzzy simplicial sets, clarifies the role of UMAP within this framework, and enables the systematic derivation of new dimensionality reduction methods."

We identify the critical conditions under which the KMNS shadow develops a gap, a unique feature not present in BH shadows. We analyze the properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding a KMNS, within the framework of MOG characterized by the parameter alpha. The study includes a detailed examination of the spacetime geometry and the equations of motion for test particles. In addition, we adopt a simplified model for the disk's radiative flux, temperature distribution, and spectral luminosity. Our analysis primarily focuses on the flux distribution of the accretion disk around KMNS with identical mass but varying spin and MOG deformation parameters. This allows us to explore how modifications in rotation and the MOG parameter alpha influence the radiative properties of the disk. Further, these observational signatures may serve as effective tools for clearly distinguishing KMNS from standard Kerr naked singularities (KNSs), where the MOG parameter alpha = 0"

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) has catalyzed the emergence of several optimization-driven subfields, notably neuromorphic computing and quantum machine learning. Leveraging the differentiable nature of hybrid models, researchers have explored their potential to address complex problems through unified optimization strategies. One such development is the Spiking Quantum Neural Network (SQNN), which combines principles from spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantum computing. However, existing SQNN implementations often depend on pretrained SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of spiking activity and the limited scalability of current SNN encoders. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, Spiking-Quantum Data Re-upload Convolutional Neural Network (SQDR-CNN), that enables joint training of convolutional SNNs and quantum circuits within a single backpropagation framework. Unlike its predecessor, SQDR-CNN allow convergence to reasonable performance without the reliance of pretrained spiking encoder and subsetting datasets. We also clarified some theoretical foundations, testing new design using quantum data-reupload with different training algorithm-initialization and evaluate the performance of the proposed model under noisy simulated quantum environments. As a result, we were able to achieve 86% of the mean top-performing accuracy of the SOTA SNN baselines, yet uses only 0.5% of the smallest spiking model's parameters. Through this integration of neuromorphic and quantum paradigms, we aim to open new research directions and foster technological progress in multi-modal, learnable systems."

    "abstract": "The standard parity doublet model with its mass-mixing mechanism fails to describe the axial charge $g_A$ of the nucleon. While $g_A = 1$ in the original Gell-Mann--Levy model, which reproduces the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of QCD, in the presence of a chirally invariant baryon mass the mass mixing leads to $g_A < 1 $ whereas phenomenologically it is about 1.28. We propose to remedy this problem by introducing kinetic-mixing terms corresponding to meson-baryon derivative couplings, similar in spirit to the two-mixing-angle scenario of the $η$-$η'$ mixing. This extended parity doublet model contains five parameters in the effective baryonic Lagrangian. Three of them can be determined by using the empirical results for the axial charge of the nucleon together with the masses of the nucleon and its parity partner, the $N^*(1535)$ resonance. We discuss various options how to determine the remaining parameters, touching upon the mass of both parity partners if the chiral condensate is put to zero; the mass of the nucleon in the chiral limit; and the values of meson-baryon coupling constants related to the decays of the resonance to pion-nucleon and sigma-nucleon."

    "abstract": "Active suspension systems are critical for enhancing vehicle comfort, safety, and stability, yet their performance is often limited by fixed hardware designs and control strategies that cannot adapt to uncertain and dynamic operating conditions. Recent advances in digital twins (DTs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offer new opportunities for real-time, data-driven optimization across a vehicle's lifecycle. However, integrating these technologies into a unified framework remains an open challenge. This work presents a DT-based control co-design (CCD) framework for full-vehicle active suspensions using multi-generation design concepts. By integrating automatic differentiation into DRL, we jointly optimize physical suspension components and control policies under varying driver behaviors and environmental uncertainties. DRL also addresses the challenge of partial observability, where only limited states can be sensed and fed back to the controller, by learning optimal control actions directly from available sensor information. The framework incorporates model updating with quantile learning to capture data uncertainty, enabling real-time decision-making and adaptive learning from digital-physical interactions. The approach demonstrates personalized optimization of suspension systems under two distinct driving settings (mild and aggressive). Results show that the optimized systems achieve smoother trajectories and reduce control efforts by approximately 43% and 52% for mild and aggressive, respectively, while maintaining ride comfort and stability. Contributions include: developing a DT-enabled CCD framework integrating DRL and uncertainty-aware model updating for full-vehicle active suspensions, introducing a multi-generation design strategy for self-improving systems, and demonstrating personalized optimization of active suspension systems for distinct driver types."

This paper introduces the Static Deep Research Agent (Static-DRA), a novel solution built upon a configurable and hierarchical Tree-based static workflow. The core contribution is the integration of two user-tunable parameters, Depth and Breadth, which provide granular control over the research intensity. This design allows end-users to consciously balance the desired quality and comprehensiveness of the research report against the associated computational cost of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions. The agent's architecture, comprising Supervisor, Independent, and Worker agents, facilitates effective multi-hop information retrieval and parallel sub-topic investigation. We evaluate the Static-DRA against the established DeepResearch Bench using the RACE (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation) framework. Configured with a depth of 2 and a breadth of 5, and powered by the gemini-2.5-pro model, the agent achieved an overall score of 34.72. Our experiments validate that increasing the configured Depth and Breadth parameters results in a more in-depth research process and a correspondingly higher evaluation score. The Static-DRA offers a pragmatic and resource-aware solution, empowering users with transparent control over the deep research process.

    "abstract": "Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) is a more realistic and challenging paradigm in continual learning to incrementally learn unseen classes and overcome catastrophic forgetting on base classes with only a few training examples. Previous efforts have primarily centered around studying more effective FSCIL approaches. By contrast, less attention was devoted to thinking the security issues in contributing to FSCIL. This paper aims to provide a holistic study of the impact of attacks on FSCIL. We first derive insights by systematically exploring how human expert-designed attack methods (i.e., PGD, FGSM) affect FSCIL. We find that those methods either fail to attack base classes, or suffer from huge labor costs due to relying on huge expert knowledge. This highlights the need to craft a specialized attack method for FSCIL. Grounded in these insights, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective ACraft method to automatically steer and discover optimal attack methods targeted at FSCIL by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) without human experts. Moreover, to improve the reasoning between LLMs and FSCIL, we introduce a novel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning to optimize learning, making LLMs generate better attack methods in the next generation by establishing positive feedback. Experiments on mainstream benchmarks show that our ACraft significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art FSCIL methods and dramatically beyond human expert-designed attack methods while maintaining the lowest costs of attack."

    "abstract": "Accurate bone strength prediction is essential for assessing fracture risk, particularly in aging populations and individuals with osteoporosis. Bone imaging has evolved from X-rays and DXA to clinical computed tomography (CT), and now to advanced modalities such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT and synchrotron radiation CT, which offer unprecedented resolution of bone microarchitecture. However, analytical methods have not kept pace with these imaging advances. This study applied topological data analysis (TDA) to extract biomechanically relevant features from high-resolution bone images, offering a new framework for bone strength prediction. We extracted topological features, specifically those derived from persistent homology, and combined them with standard bone morphometric descriptors to train machine learning models for apparent strength prediction. Models based solely on topological features outperformed those using traditional morphometrics, highlighting TDA's ability to capture biomechanically relevant structure. In particular, internal voids, often dismissed as imaging noise, proved to be the most predictive. While limited by dataset size and class imbalance, these results suggest that TDA offers a promising approach for advancing osteoporosis risk assessment."

We work within the $Φ-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to naïve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a \"squared Lorentzian\" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $Φ$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $Φ$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter."

This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $χ^2_{\\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $Λ$CDM. With current $q(0) \\in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\\text{tr}} \\sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. While the $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating that the model is not $Λ$CDM, the effective equation-of-state parameter $ω_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ stays within the quintessence regime ($-1 < ω_{\\text{eff}} < -1/3$). The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $Λ$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework."

The study reveals that, even though series-parallel training dominates current practice, parallel training consistently yields better long-term prediction accuracy. Additionally, this work clarifies the often inconsistent terminology in the literature and relate both strategies to concepts from system identification. The findings suggest that parallel training should be considered the default training strategy for neural network-based simulation of dynamical systems."

Using long-term photometric data, we investigated the cyclic behaviour of EK Dra over the last century. We analyze its short- term activity based on 13 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sectors. Applying Doppler imaging on high-resolution spectral data we investigate short and long-term spot evolution and surface differential rotation. Methods. We use Short-term Fourier-transform on a 120 years long archival photometric data in order to search for activity cycles. The short-term space photometry data is fitted with an analytic three-spot model, and we hand-select flares from it to analyze their phase and frequency distribution. Spectral synthesis is used to determine the astrophysical parameters of EK Dra. Using the iMap multi-line Doppler imaging code, we reconstruct 13 Doppler images. Differential rotation is derived by cross-correlating consecutive Doppler maps. Results. Long-term photometric data reveal a 10.7-12.1 year cycle that was persistently present for 120 years. In the more recent half of the light curve a 7.3-8.2 years-long signal is also visible. The distribution of the 142 flares in the TESS data shows no correlation with the rotational phase or with the spotted longitudes. The reconstructed Doppler images show a surface that varies from rotation to rotation, putting the lower limit of the spot lifetime between 10-15 days. Based on the cross-correlation of the Doppler maps, EK Dra has a solar-type differential rotation with a surface shear parameter of $α_{DR} = 0.030 \\pm 0.008$."

    "abstract": "Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are algorithms used to sample probability distributions, commonly used to sample the Boltzmann distribution of physical/chemical models (e.g., protein folding, Ising model, etc.). This allows us to study their properties by sampling the most probable states of those systems. However, the sampling capabilities of these methods are not sufficiently accurate when handling complex configuration spaces. This has resulted in the development of new techniques that improve sampling accuracy, usually at the expense of increasing the computational cost. One of such techniques is Parallel Tempering which improves accuracy by running several replicas which periodically exchange their states. Computationally, this imposes a significant slow-down, which can be counteracted by means of parallelization. These schemes enable MCMC/PT techniques to be run more effectively and allow larger models to be studied. In this work, we present a parallel implementation of Metropolis-Hastings with Parallel Tempering, using OpenMP and CUDA for the parallelization in modern CPUs and GPUs, respectively. The results show a maximum speed-up of 52x using OpenMP with 48 cores, and of 986x speed-up with the CUDA version. Furthermore, the results serve as a basic benchmark to compare a future quantum implementation of the same algorithm."

By applying the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence of spatially inhomogeneous steady states when a parameter approaches the principal eigenvalue of a non-self-adjoint elliptic operator. A detailed analysis of the characteristic equation further confirms the existence of Hopf bifurcations originating from these steady states. Subsequently, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we ascertain the direction of these Hopf bifurcations and the stability of the resulting periodic orbits. Finally, the proposed general theoretical results are successfully applied to a \"food-limited\" population model and a weak Allee effect-driven population model, each of which incorporates diffusion, time delay, and advection, thus confirming the validity of our approach."

In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging."

In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Object-centric process mining requires structured data, but extracting it from unstructured text remains a challenge. We introduce ExOAR (Expert-Guided Object and Activity Recognition), an interactive method that combines large language models (LLMs) with human verification to identify objects and activities from textual data. ExOAR guides users through consecutive stages in which an LLM generates candidate object types, activities, and object instances based on contextual input, such as a user's profession, and textual data. Users review and refine these suggestions before proceeding to the next stage. Implemented as a practical tool, ExOAR is initially validated through a demonstration and then evaluated with real-world Active Window Tracking data from five users. Our results show that ExOAR can effectively bridge the gap between unstructured textual data and the structured log with clear semantics needed for object-centric process analysis, while it maintains flexibility and human oversight."

    "abstract": "Clinical pathways are specialized healthcare plans that model patient treatment procedures. They are developed to provide criteria-based progression and standardize patient treatment, thereby improving care, reducing resource use, and accelerating patient recovery. However, manual modeling of these pathways based on clinical guidelines and domain expertise is difficult and may not reflect the actual best practices for different variations or combinations of diseases. We propose a two-phase modeling method using process mining, which extends the knowledge base of clinical pathways by leveraging conformance checking diagnostics. In the first phase, historical data of a given disease is collected to capture treatment in the form of a process model. In the second phase, new data is compared against the reference model to verify conformance. Based on the conformance checking results, the knowledge base can be expanded with more specific models tailored to new variants or disease combinations. We demonstrate our approach using Synthea, a benchmark dataset simulating patient treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections with varying COVID-19 complications. The results show that our method enables expanding the knowledge base of clinical pathways with sufficient precision, peaking to 95.62% AUC while maintaining an arc-degree simplicity of 67.11%."

In particular, digital traces derived from the phone's embedded movement sensors present an opportunity for a forensic investigator to gain insight into a person's physical activities. In this work, we present a machine learning-based approach to translate digital traces into likelihood ratios (LRs) for different types of physical activities. Evaluating on a new dataset, NFI\\_FARED, which contains digital traces from four different types of iPhones labelled with 19 activities, it was found that our approach could produce useful LR systems to distinguish 167 out of a possible 171 activity pairings. The same approach was extended to analyse likelihoods for multiple activities (or groups of activities) simultaneously and create activity timelines to aid in both the early and latter stages of forensic investigations. The dataset and all code required to replicate the results have also been made public to encourage further research on this topic."

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems."

Among such collective phenomena is octupole deformation, whose impact on resonance features, however, is less studied. Purpose: Investigate the effect of reflection-symmetry-breaking octupole deformation on electric and magnetic transition strengths in atomic nuclei. Methods: Calculations were performed using linear response theory with the iterative finite amplitude method (FAM) to solve quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA)-type equations. Underlying ground-state solutions were obtained within the framework of axially symmetric Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) using three different Skyrme functionals. Results: Electric and magnetic multipole responses were calculated for octupole-deformed even-even Rn, Ra, Th, U, Pu, and Cm isotopes. Calculations were performed on top of two distinct deformed ground-state solutions: one constrained to conserve parity, and the other allowing parity breaking. Sum rules were calculated from $M1$ transition strengths and compared with the expected correlations to certain ground-state properties. Conclusions: Based on our results, the octupole deformation has only a modest effect on the transition strengths in the resonances. In turn, $M1$ transition strengths have a greater effect at lower energies (0-8 MeV), which encourages further investigation. Isoscalar $E3$ transition strength was confirmed to have a significant contribution from the rotational Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode in the parity-breaking HFB solution, and thus, removing it was found necessary."

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used for motion planning, particularly in autonomous driving. Real-time capability of the planner requires utilizing convex approximation of optimal control problems (OCPs) for the planner. However, such approximations confine the solution to a subspace, which might not contain the global optimum. To address this, we propose using safe reinforcement learning (SRL) to obtain a new and safe reference trajectory within MPC. By employing a learning-based approach, the MPC can explore solutions beyond the close neighborhood of the previous one, potentially finding global optima. We incorporate constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to ensure safety in automated driving, using a handcrafted energy function-based safety index as the constraint objective to model safe and unsafe regions. Our approach utilizes a state-dependent Lagrangian multiplier, learned concurrently with the safe policy, to solve the CRL problem. Through experimentation in a highway scenario, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both MPC and SRL in terms of safety and performance measures."

While classical iterative optimization algorithms provide interpretability and theoretical guarantees, they often rely on surrogate objectives, require careful hyperparameter tuning, and exhibit substantial computational latency. Conversely, machine learning (ML ) offers powerful data-driven modeling capabilities but lacks the structure, transparency, and efficiency needed for optimization-driven inference. Deep unfolding has recently emerged as a compelling framework that bridges these two paradigms by systematically transforming iterative optimization algorithms into structured, trainable ML architectures. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of deep unfolding, presenting a unified perspective of methodologies for converting optimization solvers into ML models and highlighting their conceptual, theoretical, and practical implications. We review the foundations of optimization for inference and for learning, introduce four representative design paradigms for deep unfolding, and discuss the distinctive training schemes that arise from their iterative nature. Furthermore, we survey recent theoretical advances that establish convergence and generalization guarantees for unfolded optimizers, and provide comparative qualitative and empirical studies illustrating their relative trade-offs in complexity, interpretability, and robustness."

    "abstract": "The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts."

    "abstract": "The adequate use of information measured in a continuous manner along a period of time represents a methodological challenge. In the last decades, most of traditional statistical procedures have been extended for accommodating these functional data. The binary classification problem, which aims to correctly identify units as positive or negative based on marker values, is not aside of this scenario. The crucial point for making binary classifications based on a marker is to establish an order in the marker values, which is not immediate when these values are presented as functions. Here, we argue that if the marker is related to the characteristic under study, a trajectory from a positive participant should be more similar to trajectories from the positive population than to those drawn from the negative. With this criterion, a classification procedure based on the distance between the involved functions is proposed. Besides, we propose a fully non-parametric estimator for this so-called probability-based criterion, PBC. We explore its asymptotic properties, and its finite-sample behavior from an extensive Monte Carlo study. The observed results suggest that the proposed methodology works adequately, and frequently better than its competitors, for a wide variety of situations when the sample size in both the training and the testing cohorts is adequate. The practical use of the proposal is illustrated from real-world dataset. As online supplementary material, the manuscript includes a document with further simulations and additional comments. An R function which wraps up the implemented routines is also provided."

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{4}(1+\\frac{D}{2})} \\times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \\times q_M)$ for $D=2$. Our results give robust evidence that small, but nontrivial, quantum advantages can be achieved in the context of CFD, and motivate the need for additional rigorous end-to-end quantum algorithm development."

To handle the curl free involutions arising in the solid limit of the model, the original system is augmented by adopting a thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach. Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits. The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems."

This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface.

To address these vulnerabilities, we introduce Context-Aware Hierarchical Learning (CAHL), a sophisticated mechanism that dynamically balances semantic comprehension with role-specific instruction constraints. CAHL leverages the contextual correlations between different instruction segments to establish a robust, context-aware instruction hierarchy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAHL significantly enhances LLM robustness against both conventional attacks and the proposed TCA, exhibiting strong generalization capabilities in zero-shot evaluations while still preserving model performance on generic tasks.

Using firm-year panel data from 2008-2019, a period that covers HSR's early introduction and rapid nationwide rollout, the findings show that analysts' relative earnings forecast errors (RFE) decline significantly only after firms' cities become connected by high-speed rail. The placebo test, which artificially shifts HSR connectivity 3 years earlier than the actual opening year, yields an insignificant DID coefficient, rejecting the possibility that forecast errors were improving before the infrastructure shock. This supports the conclusion that forecast error reduction is linked to real geographic accessibility improvements rather than coincidence, pre-existing trends, or analyst anticipation. Economically, the study highlights that HSR reduces analysts' costs of gathering private, incremental information, particularly soft information obtained via plant or management visits. The rail network does not directly alter firms' internal capital allocation or earnings generation paths, but it lowers spatial barriers to information collection, enabling analysts to update EPS expectations under reduced travel friction. This work provides intuitive evidence that geography and mobility improvements contribute to forecasting accuracy in China's emerging, decentralized capital market corridors, and it encourages future research to consider transport accessibility as an exogenous information cost shock rather than an internal firm-capital shock."

    "abstract": "Coarse graining (CG) is an important task for efficient modeling and simulation of complex multi-scale systems, such as the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model."

    "abstract": "A novel scalable pixel-based reconfigurable beamforming network (PRBFN) that can be used to form a Fluid Antenna System (FAS), referred to as a PRBFN-FAS, is introduced. The concept of FAS has emerged as an attractive new technology for use in sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems, but most implementations of FAS rely on mechanically reconfigurable antennas which are hindered by inertia, and are therefore too slow to be useful. Using the insight that changing an antenna's physical position is equivalent to switching the excitation current vector of a multi-port antenna, a novel beamformer is proposed with a scalable methodology for incorporating into FAS to form a PRBFN-FAS. Key novelties in creating the PRBFN include selecting the required current vectors and concatenating beamforming networks together to form the desired PRBFN. Two PRBFN-FAS design examples are demonstrated with FAS equivalent physical movements of 0.5 and 1.5 wavelengths. Measurements demonstrate that the PRBFN-FAS provides good matching and Bessel correlation across the desired bandwidth, satisfying FAS requirements. System-level experiments confirm the viability of PRBFN-FAS in practical communication scenarios."

But there has also been work on efficient schemes for achieving multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single shot, removing the need to generate multipartite entangled states using many entangled pairs. This paper looks at how multipartite entanglement resources (e.g., GHZ states) can be useful for distributed fan-out operations; we also consider the use of qudits of dimension four for distributed quantum circuit compression. In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global Mølmer-Sørensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions. We also conclude with some implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design."

The proposed control method can effectively suppress swing and achieve precise positioning. Firstly, by enhancing the coupling relationship between the trolley displacement and swing angle, a composite signal with an error term was designed. Then, an energy-based Lyapunov function was constructed using the composite error signal, which incorporated a new formulation of the inertia matrix and potential energy function. Subsequently, using the backstepping method in conjunction with the hyperbolic tangent function, a controller with partial performance constraints was designed. In addition, to further enhance the system's dynamic performance, a fuzzy control scheme with online adjustable system parameters was designed. Finally, the stability of the system is proven using Lyapunov theory combined with LaSalle's invariance principle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits superior performance and robustness."

    "abstract": "With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure learned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEXbased Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy."

Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \\textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \\textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \\textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.

    "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a powerful method for guiding the behavior of generative models towards desired outcomes such as toxicity mitigation. However, most existing methods apply interventions uniformly across all inputs, degrading model performance when steering is unnecessary. We introduce Dynamically Scaled Activation Steering (DSAS), a method-agnostic steering framework that decouples when to steer from how to steer. DSAS adaptively modulates the strength of existing steering transformations across layers and inputs, intervening strongly only when undesired behavior is detected. At generation time, DSAS computes context-dependent scaling factors that selectively adjust the strength of any steering method. We also show how DSAS can be jointly optimized end-to-end together with the steering function. When combined with existing steering methods, DSAS consistently improves the Pareto front with respect to steering alone, achieving a better trade-off between toxicity mitigation and utility preservation. We further demonstrate DSAS's generality by applying it to a text-to-image diffusion model, showing how adaptive steering allows the modulation of specific concepts. Finally, DSAS introduces minimal computational overhead while improving interpretability, pinpointing which tokens require steering and by how much."

By using DMSO to dissolve melanin containing protonated carboxyl groups and to remove ammonium cations, it became possible to significantly reduce the ionic component of conductivity, thus improved the electron transport. It was found out that dissolution in DMSO provides a denser π-π stacking of DHICA tetramers, which led to a significant improvement in the photovoltaic cell parameters. In particular, the efficiency increased from 0.023 % to 4.4 % and the series resistance decreased from 119 Ω to 42.6 Ω. Modeling demonstrated that high-temperature annealing, which causes decarboxylation, leads to a structural rearrangement of tetramers from a Christmas tree-like configuration to a \"toothed helix\". At this, one of the planes partially straightens. This emphasizes the critical importance of the morphology of the organic layer for photogeneration of carriers in a heterojunction."

Each producer optimally adjusts both output and capacity over time in response to endogenous price signals, while investment decisions are irreversible. Market clearing holds continuously, with prices evolving endogenously to balance aggregate supply and demand through a constant-elasticity demand function driven by a stochastic base component. The model admits a mean-field interpretation, as each producer's decisions both influence and are influenced by the aggregate behaviour of all others. We show that the equilibrium price process can be expressed as a nonlinear functional of the exogenous base demand, leading to a three-dimensional singular stochastic control problem for each producer. We derive an explicit solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, including a closed-form characterisation of the free-boundary surface separating investment and waiting regions."

Comparing their vision encoder against simple alternatives--parameter-free mean pooling and a learned hierarchical encoder--we find that these simple approaches match or surpass vision for reconstruction at matched compression ratios, and outperform it for language modeling--where vision-based compression fails to beat truncation.

For cables, selecting a burial depth is a compromise between protecting the cable from anchor strike and the increased cost of deeper installation. This presents an efficient large deformation, elasto-plastic Material Point Method-based soil-structure interaction predictive tool for the estimation of anchor penetration based on Cone Penetration Test (CPT) site investigation data. The tool builds on earlier work by the authors supplemented by three developments: modelling assemblies of rigid bodies (necessary for articulated anchors), a partitioned domain approach to enable accurate and efficient modelling of long anchor pulls and an improved means of modelling rotational inertia. The tool is validated against scaled physical tests conducted in a geotechnical centrifuge on sands with a range of relative densities with good agreement across the tested conditions. Numerical simulations identify key issues with the UK Cable Burial Risk Assessment (CBRA) approach for estimating anchor penetration and reveal the potentially non-conservatism of the CBRA framework for sandy seabeds. The numerical model enables site-specific anchor-penetration assessment along cable routes and can be used to evaluate the performance of different anchor designs and sizes in varied soil conditions."

The considered systems are affected by independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) additive and parametric stochastic uncertainties (potentially unbounded), in addition to polytopic deterministic uncertainties bounding the mean of the state and input parameters. The control design conditions presented in this paper are formulated as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), using the S-variable approach in order to reduce the potential conservatism. These conditions are derived using a deterministic exact characterization of the covariance dynamics, the latter involves bilinear terms in the control gain. A technique to linearize such dynamics is presented, it results in a descriptor representation allowing to derive sufficient conditions for covariance control design. The derived condition is firstly compared to a known necessary and sufficient stability condition for systems without deterministic uncertainties and additive stochastic noise, although more conservative, it turns out to be more numerically tractable. Then, the same condition is used to design controllers that are robust to both deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. Several numerical examples are presented for comparison and illustration."

    "abstract": "Detailed routing remains one of the most complex and time-consuming steps in modern physical design due to the challenges posed by shrinking feature sizes and stricter design rules. Prior detailed routers achieve state-of-the-art results by leveraging iterative pathfinding algorithms to route each net. However, runtimes are a major issue in detailed routers, as converging to a solution with zero design rule violations (DRVs) can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to enable rapid convergence in detailed routing by learning from previous designs. We make the key observation that prior detailed routers statically schedule the cost weights used in their routing algorithms, meaning they do not change in response to the design or technology. By training a conservative Q-learning (CQL) model to dynamically select the routing cost weights which minimize the number of algorithm iterations, we find that our work completes the ISPD19 benchmarks with 1.56x average and up to 3.01x faster runtime than the baseline router while maintaining or improving the DRV count in all cases. We also find that this learning shows signs of generalization across technologies, meaning that learning designs in one technology can translate to improved outcomes in other technologies."

    "abstract": "Handling fast, complex, and highly non-linear motion patterns has long posed challenges for video frame interpolation. Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning."

Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Among the transmission technologies operating in unlicensed bands available to this purpose, Wi-Fi is certainly one of the most interesting, because of its high performance and the relatively low deployment costs.

In this paper, the use of parallel redundancy is evaluated from a quantitative viewpoint, by considering a number of performance indices that are relevant for soft real-time applications. Analysis is carried out on a large dataset acquired from a real setup, to provide realistic insights on the advantages this kind of approaches can provide. As will be seen, deferred parallel redundancy provides clear advantages in terms of the worst-case transmission latency, at limited costs concerning the amount of consumed spectrum. Hence, it can be practically exploited every time a wireless connection is included in a control loop."

    "abstract": "Conducting usability testing like cognitive walkthrough (CW) can be costly. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), with visual reasoning and UI navigation capabilities, present opportunities to automate CW. We explored whether LLMs (GPT-4 and Gemini-2.5-pro) can simulate human behavior in CW by comparing their walkthroughs with human participants. While LLMs could navigate interfaces and provide reasonable rationales, their behavior differed from humans. LLM-prompted CW achieved higher task completion rates than humans and followed more optimal navigation paths, while identifying fewer potential failure points. However, follow-up studies demonstrated that with additional prompting, LLMs can predict human-identified failure points, aligning their performance with human participants. Our work highlights that while LLMs may not replicate human behaviors exactly, they can be leveraged for scaling usability walkthroughs and providing UI insights, offering a valuable complement to traditional usability testing."

    "abstract": "Articulated object generation has seen increasing advancements, yet existing models often lack the ability to be conditioned on text prompts. To address the significant gap between textual descriptions and 3D articulated object representations, we propose GAOT, a three-phase framework that generates articulated objects from text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and hypergraph learning in a three-step process. First, we fine-tune a point cloud generation model to produce a coarse representation of objects from text prompts. Given the inherent connection between articulated objects and graph structures, we design a hypergraph-based learning method to refine these coarse representations, representing object parts as graph vertices. Finally, leveraging a diffusion model, the joints of articulated objects-represented as graph edges-are generated based on the object parts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance over previous methods."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are renowned for their state-of-the-art performance in generating synthetic images. However, concerns related to safety, privacy, and copyright highlight the need for machine unlearning, which can make diffusion models forget specific training data and prevent the generation of sensitive or unwanted content. Current machine unlearning methods for diffusion models are primarily designed for conditional diffusion models and focus on unlearning specific data classes or features. Among these methods, finetuning-based machine unlearning methods are recognized for their efficiency and effectiveness, which update the parameters of pre-trained diffusion models by minimizing carefully designed loss functions. However, in this paper, we propose a novel attack named Diffusion Model Relearning Attack (DiMRA), which can reverse the finetuning-based machine unlearning methods, posing a significant vulnerability of this kind of technique. Without prior knowledge of the unlearning elements, DiMRA optimizes the unlearned diffusion model on an auxiliary dataset to reverse the unlearning, enabling the model to regenerate previously unlearned elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel machine unlearning method for diffusion models, termed as Diffusion Model Unlearning by Memorization (DiMUM). Unlike traditional methods that focus on forgetting, DiMUM memorizes alternative data or features to replace targeted unlearning data or features in order to prevent generating such elements. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DiMRA in reversing state-of-the-art finetuning-based machine unlearning methods for diffusion models, highlighting the need for more robust solutions. We extensively evaluate DiMUM, demonstrating its superior ability to preserve the generative performance of diffusion models while enhancing robustness against DiMRA."

However, its performance is highly sensitive to problem parameters, including trajectory variables, algorithmic hyperparameters, and physical vehicle parameters. This paper introduces a differentiable sequential convex programming framework that integrates differentiable convex optimization with sequential convex programming to enable end-to-end parameter optimization. By deriving first-order sensitivity relations of second-order cone programming solutions with respect to problem data, exact gradients of trajectory performance metrics with respect to arbitrary parameters are obtained and propagated through iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through three representative applications: optimal terminal-time prediction for powered landing, trust-region penalty optimization in subproblems, and surface-to-mass ratio optimization for hypersonic gliding vehicles. Simulation results show that the proposed framework enables reliable gradient-based parameter learning and significantly improves numerical performance, convergence behavior, and design efficiency. These results indicate that differentiable sequential convex programming framework provides a powerful and general tool for vehicle design, mission optimization, and hyperparameter selection in aerospace trajectory planning."

    "abstract": "Achieving generalizable embodied policies remains a key challenge. Traditional policy learning paradigms, including both Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), struggle to cultivate generalizability across diverse scenarios. While IL policies often overfit to specific expert trajectories, RL suffers from the inherent lack of a unified and general reward signal necessary for effective multi-scene generalization. We posit that the world model is uniquely capable of serving as a universal environment proxy to address this limitation. However, current world models primarily focus on their ability to predict observations and still rely on task-specific, handcrafted reward functions, thereby failing to provide a truly general training environment. Toward this problem, we propose RoboScape-R, a framework leveraging the world model to serve as a versatile, general-purpose proxy for the embodied environment within the RL paradigm. We introduce a novel world model-based general reward mechanism that generates ''endogenous'' rewards derived from the model's intrinsic understanding of real-world state transition dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape-R effectively addresses the limitations of traditional RL methods by providing an efficient and general training environment that substantially enhances the generalization capability of embodied policies. Our approach offers critical insights into utilizing the world model as an online training strategy and achieves an average 37.5% performance improvement over baselines under out-of-domain scenarios."

EEA autonomously discovers and dynamically updates task-relevant semantic queries, and collects video frames closely matched to these queries as semantic anchors. During the tree search process, instead of uniform expansion, EEA preferentially explores semantically relevant frames while ensuring sufficient coverage within unknown segments. Moreover, EEA adaptively combines intrinsic rewards from visionlanguage models (VLMs) with semantic priors by explicitly modeling uncertainty to achieve stable and precise evaluation of video segments.

However, adapting SAM to specific downstream tasks, such as medical and agricultural imaging, remains a significant challenge. To address this, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have been widely employed to enhancing SAM's adaptation performance on diverse domains. Despite advancements, a critical question arises: can we integrate inductive bias into the model? This is particularly relevant since the Transformer encoder in SAM inherently lacks spatial priors within image patches, potentially hindering the acquisition of high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose NAS-LoRA, a new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method designed to bridge the semantic gap between pre-trained SAM and specialized domains. Specifically, NAS-LoRA incorporates a lightweight Neural Architecture Search (NAS) block between the encoder and decoder components of LoRA to dynamically optimize the prior knowledge integrated into weight updates. Furthermore, we propose a stage-wise optimization strategy to help the ViT encoder balance weight updates and architectural adjustments, facilitating the gradual learning of high-level semantic information. Various Experiments demonstrate our NAS-LoRA improves existing PEFT methods, while reducing training cost by 24.14% without increasing inference cost, highlighting the potential of NAS in enhancing PEFT for visual foundation models."

This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves."

First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding."

    "abstract": "The functional programming paradigm has a long and storied history, with its beginnings in the Lambda Calculus. In recent decades, pure functional languages such as Haskell have been shown to be highly effective in producing robust software due to immutable data structures, among other functional features. The advantages of programming with immutable data structures can also be had in non-functional languages such as Python. Over the years, non-functional languages have introduced immutable data structures as well as comprehension and lambda expressions, and it is possible to program in a purely functional style in them. In this paper, we present a ``best practice'' idea in introductory programming classes that forces students to learn and complete programming assignments in a purely functional subset of Python. By doing so, the student can learn functional ideas such as immutability, pure functions with no side effects, and stateless programming. We define a functional subset of Python and illustrate the best practice using small examples. We strongly feel that students in computing need familiarity with pure functional programming and argue that this can be taught in introductory programming courses that use Python."

Drawing on Kripke semantics, we introduce specialized neurons for the modal operators $\\Box$ and $\\Diamond$ that operate over a set of possible worlds, enabling the framework to act as a differentiable ``logical guardrail.'' The architecture is highly flexible: the accessibility relation between worlds can either be fixed by the user to enforce known rules or, as an inductive feature, be parameterized by a neural network. This allows the model to optionally learn the relational structure of a logical system from data while simultaneously performing deductive reasoning within that structure. This versatile construction is designed for flexibility. The entire framework is differentiable from end to end, with learning driven by minimizing a logical contradiction loss. This not only makes the system resilient to inconsistent knowledge but also enables it to learn nonlinear relationships that can help define the logic of a problem space. We illustrate MLNNs on four case studies: grammatical guardrailing, axiomatic detection of the unknown, multi-agent epistemic trust, and detecting constructive deception in natural language negotiation. These experiments demonstrate how enforcing or learning accessibility can increase logical consistency and interpretability without changing the underlying task architecture."

In this work, we introduce geometric regularization losses into video generation by augmenting latent diffusion models with per-frame depth prediction. We adopted depth as the geometric representation because of the great progress in depth prediction and its compatibility with image-based latent encoders. Specifically, to enforce structural consistency over time, we propose a multi-view geometric loss that aligns the predicted depth maps across frames within a shared 3D coordinate system. Our method bridges the gap between appearance generation and 3D structure modeling, leading to improved spatio-temporal coherence, shape consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our approach produces significantly more stable and geometrically consistent results than existing baselines."

Through rank-order correlation analysis, our technique identifies the optimal proxy for each video model, across model families and parameter scales, thereby ensuring optimal computational reuse.

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality."

    "abstract": "As an effective method to boost the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the question answering (QA) task, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which queries highly relevant information from external complex documents, has attracted tremendous attention from both industry and academia. Existing RAG approaches often focus on general documents, and they overlook the fact that many real-world documents (such as books, booklets, handbooks, etc.) have a hierarchical structure, which organizes their content from different granularity levels, leading to poor performance for the QA task. To address these limitations, we introduce BookRAG, a novel RAG approach targeted for documents with a hierarchical structure, which exploits logical hierarchies and traces entity relations to query the highly relevant information. Specifically, we build a novel index structure, called BookIndex, by extracting a hierarchical tree from the document, which serves as the role of its table of contents, using a graph to capture the intricate relationships between entities, and mapping entities to tree nodes. Leveraging the BookIndex, we then propose an agent-based query method inspired by the Information Foraging Theory, which dynamically classifies queries and employs a tailored retrieval workflow. Extensive experiments on three widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that BookRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baselines in both retrieval recall and QA accuracy while maintaining competitive efficiency."

Motivated by these observations, we propose Surfel-LIO, which employs a hierarchical voxel structure (hVox) with pre-computed surfel representation.

    "abstract": "Recovering jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vectors (MMV) setting is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods like multiple measurement vectors orthogonal matching pursuit (M-OMP) and multiple measurement vectors FOCal Underdetermined System Solver (M-FOCUSS) often require careful parameter tuning or prior knowledge of the sparsity of the signal and/or noise variance. We introduce a novel tuning-free framework that leverages Implicit Regularization (IR) from overparameterization to overcome this limitation. Our approach reparameterizes the estimation matrix into factors that decouple the shared row-support from individual vector entries. We show that the optimization dynamics inherently promote the desired row-sparse structure by applying gradient descent to a standard least-squares objective on these factors. We prove that with a sufficiently small and balanced initialization, the optimization dynamics exhibit a \"momentum-like\" effect, causing the norms of rows in the true support to grow significantly faster than others. This formally guarantees that the solution trajectory converges towards an idealized row-sparse solution. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to established methods without requiring any prior information or tuning."

    "abstract": "Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. Therefore, in this study we present lensing equations for binary source and lens models in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) Python microlensing package. The new binary source and lens models in BAGLE account for the complete Keplerian orbit. BAGLE also includes binary models that approximate the orbital motion as linear or accelerating motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to break several microlensing degeneracies that plague photometry-only microlensing modeling. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys."

    "abstract": "Monitoring unstructured streams increasingly requires persistent, semantics-aware computation, yet today's LLM frameworks remain stateless and one-shot, limiting their usefulness for long-running analytics. We introduce Continuous Prompts (CPs), the first framework that brings LLM reasoning into continuous stream processing. CPs extend RAG to streaming settings, define continuous semantic operators, and provide multiple implementations, primarily focusing on LLM-based approaches but also reporting one embedding-based variants. Furthermore, we study two LLM-centric optimizations, tuple batching and operator fusion, to significantly improve efficiency while managing accuracy loss. Because these optimizations inherently trade accuracy for speed, we present a dynamic optimization framework that uses lightweight shadow executions and cost-aware multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to learn throughput-accuracy frontiers and adapt plans under probing budgets. We implement CPs in the VectraFlow stream processing system. Using operator-level microbenchmarks and streaming pipelines on real datasets, we show that VectraFlow can adapt to workload dynamics, navigate accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and sustain persistent semantic queries over evolving unstructured streams."

Recent studies have suggested the possible existence of stable, iron-rich FenO compounds at around 215 GPa. Here, we performed crystal-structure searches and fully anharmonic free-energy calculations to investigate the Fe-FeO system under inner-core conditions. We identified Fe2O as a stable phase and constructed its high P-T phase diagram. Fe2O undergoes a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition with increasing pressure and temperature. It remains thermodynamically stable against decomposition into Fe and FeO from 200 to 400 GPa and at high temperatures. Although oxygen has been considered nearly absent in the inner core due to its limited solubility, these results suggest that oxygen can, in fact, be incorporated into the solid inner core in the form of an Fe+Fe2O mixture, and can match PREM densities for 53 mol% Fe2O. Our work has the potential to lead to a significant revision of the current understanding of the core's structure and composition."

    "abstract": "Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. Despite the pronounced growth of ionic clusters, their percolation transition does not appear to be directly coupled to the onset of these crossovers. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems."

However, the standard first-order attention mechanism is often limited by a low-rank bottleneck, struggling to capture intricate, multi-hop relationships within a single layer. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Higher-Order Attention Network (Hon)}, a novel architecture designed to enhance representational power through a recursive framework. Unlike standard approaches that use static linear projections for Queries and Keys, Hon dynamically refines these representations via nested self-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the Query and Key vectors are themselves outputs of inner attention loops, allowing tokens to aggregate global context and model high-order correlations \\textit{prior} to the final attention computation. We enforce a parameter-efficient weight-sharing strategy across recursive steps, ensuring that this enhanced expressivity incurs $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional parameters. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our method breaks the linear bottleneck of standard attention. Empirically, Hon outperforms standard Transformers on multiple benchmarks."

This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions."

    "abstract": "Online A/B testing, the gold standard for evaluating new advertising policies, consumes substantial engineering resources and risks significant revenue loss from deploying underperforming variations. This motivates the use of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) for rapid, offline assessment. However, applying OPE to ad auctions is fundamentally more challenging than in domains like recommender systems, where stochastic policies are common. In online ad auctions, it is common for the highest-bidding ad to win the impression, resulting in a deterministic, winner-takes-all setting. This results in zero probability of exposure for non-winning ads, rendering standard OPE estimators inapplicable. We introduce the first principled framework for OPE in deterministic auctions by repurposing the bid landscape model to approximate the propensity score. This model allows us to derive robust approximate propensity scores, enabling the use of stable estimators like Self-Normalized Inverse Propensity Scoring (SNIPS) for counterfactual evaluation. We validate our approach on the AuctionNet simulation benchmark and against 2-weeks online A/B test from a large-scale industrial platform. Our method shows remarkable alignment with online results, achieving a 92\\% Mean Directional Accuracy (MDA) in CTR prediction, significantly outperforming the parametric baseline. MDA is the most critical metric for guiding deployment decisions, as it reflects the ability to correctly predict whether a new model will improve or harm performance. This work contributes the first practical and validated framework for reliable OPE in deterministic auction environments, offering an efficient alternative to costly and risky online experiments."

In particular, we focus on the fraction of unstable dark matter, $α_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}$ respect to the ordinary CDM component, and the decay rate, $Γ_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}$ as the key parameters of the model. Fiducial values are derived from a MontePython MCMC analysis. The derivatives of the growth-related observable, $fσ_8(z)$ with respect to the parameters are numerically around the fiducial model. For the Fisher analysis, we employ mock data designed for upcoming surveys, particularly Euclid and BOSS, where RSD measurements yield constraints on $fσ_8.$ Our results show that when both stable and unstable components are allowed, constrains on the DCDM lifetime remain weak, with $τ_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}>1.18$ Gyr. In the limiting case of fully unstable dark matter ($α_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}=1$), the uncertainty improves to $τ_{\\mathrm{dcdm}}>235.89$ Gyr. Our findings highlight the potential of RSD probes in testing and complementing decaying dark matter scenarios."

We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results."

The heating of the ISM by supernova shocks, and its subsequent cooling is critical to future star formation. The cooling of the diffuse shock-heated ISM is dominated by ultraviolet (UV) emission lines. These cooling regions and interfaces have complex spatial structure on sub-parsec scales. Mapping this cooling process is essential to understanding the feedback cycle of galaxies, a major goal of the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The Supernova remnants and Proxies for ReIonization Testbed Experiment (SPRITE) CubeSat Mission will house the first long-slit orbital spectrograph with sub-arcminute angular resolution covering far ultraviolet wavelengths (FUV; 1000 - 1750 angstroms) and access to the Lyman UV (lambda < 1216 angstroms). SPRITE aims to provide new insights into the stellar feedback that drives galaxy evolution by mapping key FUV emission lines at the interaction lines between supernova remnants (SNRs) and the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). SPRITE will also measure the ionizing escape from approximately 50 low-redshift (0.16 < z < 0.4) star-forming galaxies. Current models predict SPRITE capable of detecting strong O VI, O IV], and C IV emission lines with angular resolution from 10 - 20 arcseconds. The SPRITE SNR survey will use push-broom mapping of its long-slit on extended sources to produce the first large sample of sub-arcminute 3D data cubes of extended sources in the FUV. In this paper, we present simulated SPRITE observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) SNRs to demonstrate the efficacy of the SPRITE instrument ahead of launch and instrument commissioning. These models serve as critical planning tools and incorporate the final pre-flight predicted performance of the instrument and the early extended source data reduction pipeline."

In this paper, we provide a stochastic analytic proof of the formula for the invariant measures. Our approach starts from the Gaussian invariant measure for the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. We approximate the inhomogeneous problem by a homogeneous one with a singular boundary potential. Using tools including change of measure, time reversal for Markov processes, and Itô's formula, we then reduce the problem to analyzing the KPZ nonlinearity in a thin boundary layer. Finally, using the theory of regularity structures, we establish a central limit theorem for the time-integrated nonlinearity near the boundary, which completes the proof of the invariance. Although it is known that different boundary parameters give rise to distinct physical regimes for the invariant measures, our method is robust and does not rely on any particular choice of boundary parameters."

First, they add random noise to training samples or VAE latents as data augmentation, introducing complex pipelines including extra noising and denoising steps. Second, they use a pretrained and frozen VAE encoder, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction and generation quality. In this paper, we find that the two issues can be solved in a very simple way: just fixing the variance (which would otherwise be predicted by the VAE encoder) to a constant (e.g., 0.5). On the one hand, this method allows the encoder to output a broader distribution of tokens and the decoder to learn to reconstruct clean images from the augmented token distribution, avoiding additional noise or denoising design. On the other hand, fixed variance simplifies the VAE evidence lower bound, making it stable to train an NF with a VAE jointly. On the ImageNet $256 \\times 256$ generation task, our model SimFlow obtains a gFID score of 2.15, outperforming the state-of-the-art method STARFlow (gFID 2.40). Moreover, SimFlow can be seamlessly integrated with the end-to-end representation alignment (REPA-E) method and achieves an improved gFID of 1.91, setting a new state of the art among NFs."

We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies.

Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications."

In particular, control loops in compressor-plenum-throttle systems cannot tolerate costly interruptions, and aggressive excitation may lead to unsafe operating regimes. Given the wide availability of historical data, this paper introduces a counterfactual explainability approach for sample-efficient retuning of compressor control loops. The proposed data-driven algorithm determines, without an explicit plant model or previous control law, the smallest controller adjustment required to achieve predefined performance specifications while guaranteeing stability. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study."

We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit."

Unlike existing analyses, which relies on the weak coupling Lindblad limit and require $O(ε)$ coupling strengths for $ε$ accuracy, leading to slow mixing, we rigorously show that accurate state preparation remains possible far beyond this regime. In particular, even when the cumulative coupling strength remains constant rather than vanishing, the induced quantum channel still approximately fixes the target state. Our proof introduces new techniques for controlling all orders of the Dyson expansion and for analyzing the associated multidimensional operator Fourier transforms. These bounds substantially improve upon prior results, and numerical simulations on the TFIM and Hubbard models further confirm the robustness of the system bath interaction framework across both weak and strong coupling regimes."

We propose a peak inference method that first subjects observed peaks to a significance test of the null hypothesis that no signal is present, and then uses the peaks that are declared significant to construct post-selectively valid confidence regions for the location and height of nearby true peaks. We analyze the performance of this method in a smooth signal plus constant variance noise model under a high-curvature asymptotic assumption, and prove that it asymptotically controls both the number of false discoveries, and the number of confidence regions that do not contain a true peak, relative to the number of points at which inference is conducted. An important intermediate theoretical result uses the Kac-Rice formula to derive a novel approximation to the intensity function of a point process that counts local maxima, which is second-order accurate under the alternative, nearby high-curvature true peaks."

    "abstract": "In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance."

Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size.

Using a qualitative approach, this paper examined this digital transition of Sarafu Network in Kenya and its predecessor CCs as a case study. From the original vouchers launched in 2010, the foundation Grassroots Economics introduced a digital interface in 2016 that operates on a feature phone, and then integrated blockchain technology starting in 2018, undergoing several migrations before becoming settling on its current iteration called Community Asset Vouchers on the Celo blockchain since 2023. Using affordances from human-computer interaction, the research shows that digitalization and blockchain improved the facilitation of economic activities of the local communities, both their typical market transactions as well as traditional reciprocal labor exchanges, by offering more functionalities compared to the analog version of Sarafu. The unique contributions of blockchain include enabling automation of holding tax calculations and linking the vouchers to the mainstream monetary system via stablecoins facilitated by a series of smart contracts also known as the liquidity pool. The study also finds that there is an inherent trade-off between blockchain benefits and user interface complexity. Hence, balancing innovation and community needs remains a challenge."

The results indicate that, although the use of traditional positional encodings is valid for modeling sketches as sequences, absolute coordinates consistently outperform relative ones. Furthermore, non-autoregressive decoders outperform their autoregressive counterparts. Finally, the importance of temporality was shown to depend on both the order considered and the task evaluated."

This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256."

    "abstract": "Aligning proprietary large language models (LLMs) with internal organizational policies has become an urgent priority as organizations increasingly deploy LLMs in sensitive domains such as legal support, finance, and medical services. Beyond generic safety filters, enterprises require reliable mechanisms to detect policy violations within their regulatory and operational frameworks, where breaches can trigger legal and reputational risks. Existing content moderation frameworks, such as guardrails, remain largely confined to the safety domain and lack the robustness to capture nuanced organizational policies. LLM-as-a-judge and fine-tuning approaches, though flexible, introduce significant latency and lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free and efficient method that treats policy violation detection as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Inspired by whitening techniques, we apply a linear transformation to decorrelate the model's hidden activations and standardize them to zero mean and unit variance, yielding near-identity covariance matrix. In this transformed space, we use the Euclidean norm as a compliance score to detect policy violations. The method requires only the policy text and a small number of illustrative samples, which makes it light-weight and easily deployable. On a challenging policy benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing guardrails and fine-tuned reasoning models. This work provides organizations with a practical and statistically grounded framework for policy-aware oversight of LLMs, advancing the broader goal of deployable AI governance.

We introduce DIQ-H, the first benchmark for evaluating VLM robustness under dynamic visual degradation in temporal sequences. DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement. Experiments on 16 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal substantial robustness gaps: even advanced models such as GPT-4o achieve only a 78.5 percent recovery rate, while open-source models struggle with temporal consistency at less than 60 percent. DIQ-H provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating VLM reliability in real-world deployments."

We propose continued BPE training, which adapts a pre-trained tokenizer by continuing the BPE merge learning process on new data. Experiments across multiple languages and model families show that this approach improves tokenization efficiency and leads to better utilization of added vocabulary. We also introduce leaf-based vocabulary pruning, which removes redundant tokens while preserving model quality. Together, these methods provide practical tools for controlled vocabulary modification, which we release as an open-source package."

Unlike other mechanisms of phase conjugation, the perfect time-domain lens time-reverses both the propagating waves and the evanescent part of the spectrum. Moreover, we find that the time-reversed wave can be slowed down or accelerated, depending on the refractive index ratio. We show that this effect remains strong even when the refractive index varies arbitrarily slow, in sharp contradistinction to time-reflection which necessitates large index changes at sub-cycle rates. This is the first avenue found to yield significant negative-frequency waves using a temporal interface without the need for sub-cycle modulation or impedance matching. The effect can be used to record extreme ultrafast information and subsequently play it backwards at a slow rate, and vice-versa."

However, existing methods rely heavily on manually provided masks and textual prompts to preserve semantic fidelity and motion precision. Removing these constraints creates a fundamental trade-off: visual artifacts without masks and poor spatial control without prompts. To address these limitations, we propose DirectDrag, a novel mask- and prompt-free editing framework. DirectDrag enables precise and efficient manipulation with minimal user input while maintaining high image fidelity and accurate point alignment. DirectDrag introduces two key innovations. First, we design an Auto Soft Mask Generation module that intelligently infers editable regions from point displacement, automatically localizing deformation along movement paths while preserving contextual integrity through the generative model's inherent capacity. Second, we develop a Readout-Guided Feature Alignment mechanism that leverages intermediate diffusion activations to maintain structural consistency during point-based edits, substantially improving visual fidelity. Despite operating without manual mask or prompt, DirectDrag achieves superior image quality compared to existing methods while maintaining competitive drag accuracy. Extensive experiments on DragBench and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DirectDrag for high-quality, interactive image manipulation.

    "abstract": "Object-oriented Programming has become one of the most dominant design paradigms as the separation of concerns and adaptability of design reduce development and maintenance costs. However, the convenience is not without cost. The added indirection inherent in such designs causes excessive pointer chasing, negatively affecting locality, which in turn degrades the performance of cache structures. Furthermore, modern hardware prefetchers are mostly stride prefetchers that are ill-equipped to handle the unpredictability of access patterns generated by pointer chasing. Most software approaches that seek to address this problem resort to profiling the program as it runs, which comes with a significant run-time overhead or requires data from previous runs. In this paper, we propose the use of compile-time static analysis to predict the most common access patterns displayed by a program during run time. Since Java is one of the most popular object-oriented languages, we implement our prototype within the OpenJ9 JVM, inside the OMR optimizer infrastructure. The outputs of our proposed predictor are Markov chains that model the expected behavior of the program. The effectiveness of the proposed predictor is evaluated by comparing the model with the actual run-time behavior of the program measured using an instrumented interpreter. Our experiments show that the proposed predictor exhibits good accuracy and can be used to inform minimally intrusive load stall mitigation strategies, e.g. informing copying GCs on more locality-friendly copying orders"

Anguilliform swimmers spread motion along the body, while carangiform swimmers' motion is more prominent near their tails. Many species also switch between continuous undulation and intermittent swimming, such as burst-and-coast maneuver, which can save energy but can also change the wake structure and hydrodynamic forces. Our current study aims at explaining} how duty cycle (DC), undulatory gaits, and Strouhal number (St), shape the near-body vortices, overall wakes, and the hydrodynamic forces. We carry out three-dimensional simulations at Re = 3000 for flows around an eel (anguilliform) and a Jack Fish (carangiform) for DC = 0.2-1.0 and St = 0.30 and 0.40. Our results reveal that the burst-and-coast motion for both swimmer produce bow-shaped wakes, the two rows of which on the sides approach each other to form a more coherent wake as DC is increased to 1.0 that corresponds to the wake of continuously undulating swimmers. It is also found that the intermittent motion at a higher Strouhal number produces more drag, contrary to the continuous undulatory kinematics. We further investigate this behavior by quantifying the strengths of vortices produced around the two swimmers and their instantaneous kinematic metrics. A detailed analysis for the role of different body sections in the production of unsteady streamwise forces is also presented. These insights provide important connections between the swimmers' physiologies, their kinematics, and the governing vortex dynamics to attain certain hydrodynamic metrics for designing next-generation autonomous bio-inspired underwater robots."

    "abstract": "Estimating the health impacts of exposure to a mixture of chemicals poses many statistical challenges: multiple correlated exposure variables, moderate to high dimensionality, and possible nonlinear and interactive health effects of mixture components. Reviews of chemical mixture methods aim to help researchers select a statistical method suited to their goals and data, but examinations of empirical performance have emphasized novel methods purpose-built for analyzing complex chemical mixtures, or other more advanced methods, over more general methods which are widely used in many application domains. We conducted a broad experimental comparison, across simulated scenarios, of both more general methods (such as generalized linear models) and novel methods (such as Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) designed to study chemical mixtures. We assessed methods based on their ability to control Type I error rate, maximize power, provide interpretable results, and make accurate predictions. We find that when there is moderate correlation between mixture components and the exposure-response function does not have complicated interactions, or when mixture components have opposite effects, general methods are preferred over novel ones. With highly interactive exposure-response functions or highly correlated exposures, novel methods provide important benefits. We provide a comprehensive summary of when different methods are most suitable."

We show that they can be expanded in a functional series, analogous to the DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel, by integrating the latter term-by-term. This procedure leads to a separation of two types of data: all information about the bundle geometry and the operator $\\hat F(\\nabla)$ is still contained in the standard HaMiDeW coefficients $\\hat a_k[F | x,x']$ (we call this property ``off-diagonal functoriality''), while information about the function $f$ is encoded in some new scalar functions $\\mathbb{B}_α[f | σ]$ and $\\mathbb{W}_α[f | σ, m^2]$, which we call basis and complete massive kernels, respectively. These objects are calculated for operator functions of the form $\\exp(-τ\\hat F^ν)/(\\hat F^μ+ λ)$ as multiple Mellin--Barnes integrals. The article also discusses subtle issues such as the validity of the term-by-term integration, the regularization of IR divergent integrals, and the physical interpretation of the resulting expansions."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving planning systems perform nearly perfectly in routine scenarios using lightweight, rule-based methods but still struggle in dense urban traffic, where lane changes and merges require anticipating and influencing other agents. Modern motion predictors offer highly accurate forecasts, yet their integration into planning is mostly rudimental: discarding unsafe plans. Similarly, end-to-end models offer a one-way integration that avoids the challenges of joint prediction and planning modeling under uncertainty. In contrast, game-theoretic formulations offer a principled alternative but have seen limited adoption in autonomous driving. We present Bayesian Iterative Best Response (BIBeR), a framework that unifies motion prediction and game-theoretic planning into a single interaction-aware process. BIBeR is the first to integrate a state-of-the-art predictor into an Iterative Best Response (IBR) loop, repeatedly refining the strategies of the ego vehicle and surrounding agents. This repeated best-response process approximates a Nash equilibrium, enabling bidirectional adaptation where the ego both reacts to and shapes the behavior of others. In addition, our proposed Bayesian confidence estimation quantifies prediction reliability and modulates update strength, more conservative under low confidence and more decisive under high confidence. BIBeR is compatible with modern predictors and planners, combining the transparency of structured planning with the flexibility of learned models. Experiments show that BIBeR achieves an 11% improvement over state-of-the-art planners on highly interactive interPlan lane-change scenarios, while also outperforming existing approaches on standard nuPlan benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a logic programming-based framework for policy-aware autonomous agents that can reason about potential penalties for non-compliance and act accordingly. While prior work has primarily focused on ensuring compliance, our approach considers scenarios where deviating from policies may be necessary to achieve high-stakes goals. Additionally, modeling non-compliant behavior can assist policymakers by simulating realistic human decision-making. Our framework extends Gelfond and Lobo's Authorization and Obligation Policy Language (AOPL) to incorporate penalties and integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) for reasoning. Compared to previous approaches, our method ensures well-formed policies, accounts for policy priorities, and enhances explainability by explicitly identifying rule violations and their consequences. Building on the work of Harders and Inclezan, we introduce penalty-based reasoning to distinguish between non-compliant plans, prioritizing those with minimal repercussions. To support this, we develop an automated translation from the extended AOPL into ASP and refine ASP-based planning algorithms to account for incurred penalties. Experiments in two domains demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality plans that avoid harmful actions while, in some cases, also improving computational efficiency. These findings underscore its potential for enhancing autonomous decision-making and informing policy refinement. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)."

The qubit is represented as a positive probability distribution over two classical bits, a and a', denoted by p(aa'). The measurement apparatus is described by a classical bit $α= \\pm 1$, initialized in the pure distribution $p(α) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + α)$. The measurement interaction is modeled by a quasi-bistochastic process $ S(bb'β\\mid aa'α)$ - a bistochastic map that may include negative transition probabilities, while acting on an entirely positive state space. When this process acts on the joint initial state $p(aa')p(α)$, it produces a collapsed state $p(bb'\\midβ)$, yielding the measurement outcome $β$ with the correct quantum-mechanical probability $p(β)$. This approach bypasses the von Neumann chain of infinite couplings by treating the measurement register classically, while capturing the nonclassical nature of measurement through the quasi-bistochastic structure of the interaction."

Standard VAEs match latents to a simple prior, overlooking density structure in the data-space. DiVAE encourages the encoder to allocate posterior mass in proportion to data-space density and, when the prior is learnable, nudges the prior toward high-density regions. This is realized by adding a robust, precision-weighted penalty to the ELBO, incurring negligible computational overhead. On synthetic datasets, DiVAE (i) improves distributional alignment of latent log-densities to its ground truth counterpart, (ii) improves prior coverage, and (iii) yields better OOD uncertainty calibration. On MNIST, DiVAE improves alignment of the prior with external estimates of the density, providing better interpretability, and improves OOD detection for learnable priors."

    "abstract": "Polarization is a fundamental property of light that carries distinct and valuable information. Consequently, its precise measurement is crucial for numerous applications, including biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and optical communication. Since polarization cannot be measured directly, it is typically inferred by converting it into intensity signals using dedicated optical elements. Conventional approaches, however, predominantly rely on bulky optical components, leading to considerably high fabrication costs and limited integration density. Here, we introduce a passive photonic integrated circuit capable of precisely determining the polarization state of visible free-space light. An silicon nitride on-chip architecture employing a compact polarization-splitting grating coupler and a set of passive interferometers encodes the polarization information into intensity signals, allowing conventional detectors to accurately reconstruct the polarization state. With increasing compactness of photonic components, however, susceptibility to fabrication tolerances as well as intrinsic design constraints increases, potentially leading to non\\-/ideal behaviour. To address this, we introduce a robust calibration procedure that enables precise measurements even in the presence of imperfections. The chip design, combined with the calibration procedure, offers a robust, small-footprint, and high-speed approach to polarimetry, enabling a wide range of applications."

The general theory provides a framework for constructing controlled approximations to one-particle and two-particle Green functions that satisfy the necessary conservation laws and causality requirements in the whole range of disorder strength.

    "abstract": "Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $Δ$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature."

The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA. Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $μ$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $μ$m), via image reconstruction techniques. Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $μ$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $μ$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $μ$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers. Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $μ$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $μ$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars."

Significant frequency deviations-up to 50% of the cavity linewidth-can arise when the optical offset is obtained from a sinusoidally driven EOM. We measure this deviation experimentally, find agreement with a simple model, and show how a spectrally-pure frequency offset can reduce the deviation by an order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "The growing global population of older adults, combined with ongoing healthcare workforce shortages, has increased reliance on informal caregivers, including family members and friends who provide unpaid support to individuals with chronic illnesses. Among their daily responsibilities, medication management remains one of the most demanding and error-prone tasks. Non-adherence to prescribed regimens not only undermines patient outcomes but also intensifies caregiver stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Although digital health technologies have proliferated to address adherence, most solutions focus exclusively on patients and neglect the informational and emotional needs of caregivers. This paper introduces Adhera, a caregiver-inclusive health informatics system designed to support medication adherence while reducing caregiver burden. Using a mixed-methods research design that included fifteen semi-structured caregiver interviews, sixty-five survey responses, and five pharmacist consultations, this study identified three primary challenges: caregiver stress related to uncertainty about medication intake, fragmented communication with healthcare professionals, and distrust in existing digital tools. Informed by the CeHRes Roadmap 2.0 and the Triple Bottom Line by Design and Culture (TBLD+C) framework, as well as recent co-design studies involving caregivers, Adhera integrates a sensor-equipped smart pill organizer with a mobile companion application that records intake events, sends real-time reminders, and provides caregivers with synchronized adherence data. Preliminary evaluation suggests that Adhera enhances visibility, improves caregiver confidence, and streamlines medication routines. This study contributes to the field of health informatics by demonstrating how human-centered design and collaborative frameworks can align technical innovation with empathy-driven care."

To address these limitations, we present OmniDexVLG, a multimodal, semantics aware grasp generation framework capable of producing structurally diverse and semantically coherent dexterous grasps under joint language and visual guidance. Our approach begins with OmniDexDataGen, a semantic rich dexterous grasp dataset generation pipeline that integrates grasp taxonomy guided configuration sampling, functional affordance contact point sampling, taxonomy aware differential force closure grasp sampling, and physics based optimization and validation, enabling systematic coverage of diverse grasp types. We further introduce OmniDexReasoner, a multimodal grasp type semantic reasoning module that leverages multi agent collaboration, retrieval augmented generation, and chain of thought reasoning to infer grasp related semantics and generate high quality annotations that align language instructions with task specific grasp intent. Building upon these components, we develop a unified Vision Language Grasping generation model that explicitly incorporates grasp taxonomy, contact structure, and functional affordance semantics, enabling fine grained control over grasp synthesis from natural language instructions. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world object grasping and ablation studies demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state of the art approaches in terms of grasp diversity, contact semantic diversity, functional affordance diversity, and semantic consistency."

However, developing private multiple testing algorithms for super uniform $p$-values remains an open question, as privacy mechanisms introduce intricate dependence among the peeled $p$-values and disrupt their super uniformity, complicating post-selection inference. To address this, we introduce a general Super Uniform Private (SUP) multiple testing framework with three key components. First, we develop a novel \\( p \\)-value transformation that is compatible with diverse privacy regimes while retaining the super uniformity. Next, a reversed peeling algorithm is designed to reduce privacy budgets while facilitating inference. Then, we provide diverse rejection thresholds that are privacy-parameter-free and tailored for different Type-I errors, including the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR). Building upon these, we advance adaptive techniques to determine the peeling number and boost thresholds. Theoretically, we propose a technique overcoming the post-selection obstacle to Type-I error control, quantify the privacy-induced power loss of SUP relative to its non-private counterpart, and demonstrate that SUP surpasses existing private methods in terms of power. The results of extensive simulations and a real data application validate our theories."

Here this approach is applied to a system of $d$ stochastic differential equations for $[x_1(t),..,x_d(t)]$ when the forces and the diffusion-matrix elements are polynomials, in order to write the linear system governing the dynamics of the averaged values ${\\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) ... x_d^{n_d}(t) )$ labelled by the $d$ integers $(n_1,..,n_d)$. The natural decomposition of the Carleman matrix into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2+..+n_d$ is useful to identify the models that have the simplest spectral decompositions in the bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. This analysis is then applied to models with a single noise per coordinate, that can be either additive or multiplicative or square-root, or with two types of noises per coordinate, with many examples in dimensions $d=1,2$. In $d=1$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the moments ${\\mathbb E} ( x^{n}(t) )$ is diagonal for the Geometric Brownian motion, while it is lower-triangular for the family of Pearson diffusions containing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Square-Root processes, as well as the Kesten, the Fisher-Snedecor and the Student processes that converge towards steady states with power-law-tails. In dimension $d=2$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the correlations ${\\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) )$ has a natural decomposition into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2$, and we discuss the simplest models where the Carleman matrix is either block-diagonal or block-lower-triangular or block-upper-triangular."

    "abstract": "Traffic image restoration under adverse weather conditions remains a critical challenge for intelligent transportation systems. Existing methods primarily focus on spatial-domain modeling but neglect frequency-domain priors. Although the emerging Mamba architecture excels at long-range dependency modeling through patch-wise correlation analysis, its potential for frequency-domain feature extraction remains unexplored. To address this, we propose Frequency-Aware Mamba (FAMamba), a novel framework that integrates frequency guidance with sequence modeling for efficient image restoration. Our architecture consists of two key components: (1) a Dual-Branch Feature Extraction Block (DFEB) that enhances local-global interaction via bidirectional 2D frequency-adaptive scanning, dynamically adjusting traversal paths based on sub-band texture distributions; and (2) a Prior-Guided Block (PGB) that refines texture details through wavelet-based high-frequency residual learning, enabling high-quality image reconstruction with precise details. Meanwhile, we design a novel Adaptive Frequency Scanning Mechanism (AFSM) for the Mamba architecture, which enables the Mamba to achieve frequency-domain scanning across distinct subgraphs, thereby fully leveraging the texture distribution characteristics inherent in subgraph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of FAMamba."

Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation. The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1°C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss. This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults."

    "abstract": "Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."

Building on prior work that used 2D ion crystals to investigate one-dimensional (1D) nanofriction and orientational melting, we leverage this foundation to extend friction studies from linear ion chains and planar rings to 3D shell structures. Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we first map shell formation as a function of ion number $N$ and the trapping aspect ratio, yielding a simple relation that can aid ion-number estimation in experiments. We compute a Peierls--Nabarro-type energy landscape for the rotation of the outer shell against the inner core, showing drastic changes in the effective energy barrier up to a factor of about 60 with only small changes in $N$. Using dynamical simulations, we apply rotational torques to the outer shell of selected systems and show that small changes in $N$ impact the commensurability between shells and can, in some cases, induce a hysteretic response due to torque-induced metastable states. We find that spatially varying coupling to the inner-core corrugation can create coexisting fast and slow moving domains within the rotating outer shell, realizing multidimensional friction where intra-shell shear and inter-shell nanofriction act simultaneously. Our results have implications for stabilizing many-body systems and for the development of ultra-low-friction nanomechanical devices such as ion-based nanorotors and torque sensors."

Beam tuning in such machines is traditionally performed manually, a process that can be slow, non-optimal, and difficult to execute in the presence of faults or changing conditions. To address this, we developed and deployed a machine learning (ML) based tuning framework on the Injector 2 cyclotron at PSI, chosen as an ideal testbed for high-power operation. The system combined a tailored reinforcement learning algorithm with real-time diagnostics and control, and incorporated accelerator-physics inspired adaptations such as an overshoot strategy that reduced magnetic field settling times by nearly a factor of six. Over an extensive 12-day operational test campaign, relatively long in the context of real-time ML experiments, the ML agent successfully tuned the machine across multiple operating points, achieving convergence within hours and maintaining stable beam extraction with reduced losses. Beyond initial tuning, the system was also operated in evaluation mode overnight, where it autonomously monitored and corrected the machine to compensate for drifts, demonstrating robustness and long-term stability. Crucially, the learned policy generalized reliably from low-current training to higher-current operation, underscoring its scalability. These results constitute the first demonstration of ML-assisted tuning on a high-power cyclotron, with direct relevance to ADS-class drivers."

Recent developments include the integration of an energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) line based on a silicon pin-diode detector, which enables flux monitoring and simultaneous ED and WD measurements.

These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement."

While this property holds in homogeneous systems such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process, how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect this symmetry has remained unclear. Here, we establish a general criterion showing that the bias-reversal symmetry holds if and only if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal that bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, whereas site disorder breaks it through an interplay between heterogeneity and particle interactions. Our results demonstrate how environmental disorder and interparticle interactions cooperate to generate asymmetric transport, thereby providing a unified theoretical framework relevant to transport through biological and artificial nanochannels."

    "abstract": "Due to their architecture and vast pre-training data, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text classification performance. However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical."

Unlike the prior art, we focus on uncovering the research gaps that must be addressed to enforce security policy regulations in civilian off-the-shelf drone systems. To that end, we first examine the known security threats to UAVs based on their impact and effectiveness. We then analyze existing countermeasures to prevent, detect, and respond to these threats in terms of security and performance overhead. We further outline the future research directions for securing UAVs. Finally, we establish the fundamental requirements and highlight critical research challenges in introducing a regulatory entity to achieve a secure and regulated UAV network."

    "abstract": "Cross-chain technology enables interoperability among otherwise isolated blockchains, supporting interactions across heterogeneous networks. Similar to how multi-hop communication became fundamental in the evolution of the Internet, the demand for multi-hop cross-chain interactions is gaining increasing attention. However, this growing demand introduces new security and privacy challenges. On the security side, multi-hop interactions depend on the availability of multiple participating nodes. If any node becomes temporarily offline during execution, the protocol may fail to complete correctly, leading to settlement failure or fund loss. On the privacy side, the need for on-chain transparency to validate intermediate states may unintentionally leak linkable information, compromising the unlinkability of user interactions. In this paper, we propose the Cross-Chain Channel Network (CCN), a decentralized network designed to support secure and privacy-preserving multi-hop cross-chain transactions. Through experimental evaluation, we identify two critical types of offline failures, referred to as active and passive offline cases, which have not been adequately addressed by existing solutions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce R-HTLC, a core protocol within CCN. R-HTLC incorporates an hourglass mechanism and a multi-path refund strategy to ensure settlement correctness even when some nodes go offline during execution. Importantly, CCN addresses not only the correctness under offline conditions but also maintains unlinkability in such adversarial settings. To overcome this, CCN leverages zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain coordination, ensuring that interaction relationships remain indistinguishable even when certain nodes are temporarily offline."

Perovskite oxide heterointerfaces offer a promising route to engineer these orbital states. In this work, we tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy in LaCoO$_3$ from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state through interfacial engineering with LaTiO$_3$, LaMnO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with charge transfer multiplet calculations, we identify differences in the Co valence and spin state for the series of oxide heterostructures. LaTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ interfaces result in interfacial charge transfer towards LaCoO$_3$, resulting in a partial $d^7$ orbital occupancy, while a LaNiO$_3$ interface results in a partial Co $d^5$ occupancy. Strikingly, a LaAlO$_3$ spacer layer between LaNiO$_3$ and LaCoO$_3$ results in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. These results indicate that the Co spin state, like the valence state, is governed by the interfacial environment. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals a clear connection between strain and spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control at oxide interfaces. Overall, this work demonstrates that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides, advancing spin-engineering strategies in correlated oxides and offering new insights for the rational design of functional oxide heterostructures."

We further construct a comprehensive adaptive reasoning benchmark that spans text-only, text-audio, text-visual, and text-audio-visual modalities, providing both training and evaluation splits for multimodal reasoning assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves adaptive reasoning performance compared to previous baselines.

This flexibility is achieved through the hierarchical Dirichlet process prior, while efficient Bayesian inference is enabled by the beam sampler, which combines dynamic programming with slice sampling to truncate the infinite state space adaptively. Despite extensive methodological developments, the role of initialization in this framework has received limited attention. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating initialization strategies commonly used for finite hidden Markov models and assessing their suitability in the infinite setting. Results from both simulated and real datasets show that distance-based clustering initializations consistently outperform model-based and uniform alternatives, the latter being the most widely adopted in the existing literature."

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged and become a promising approach to achieving AHD, but current LLM-based AHD research often only considers a single role. This paper proposes RoCo, a novel Multi-Agent Role-Based System, to enhance the diversity and quality of AHD through multi-role collaboration. RoCo coordinates four specialized LLM-guided agents-explorer, exploiter, critic, and integrator-to collaboratively generate high-quality heuristics. The explorer promotes long-term potential through creative, diversity-driven thinking, while the exploiter focuses on short-term improvements via conservative, efficiency-oriented refinements. The critic evaluates the effectiveness of each evolution step and provides targeted feedback and reflection. The integrator synthesizes proposals from the explorer and exploiter, balancing innovation and exploitation to drive overall progress. These agents interact in a structured multi-round process involving feedback, refinement, and elite mutations guided by both short-term and accumulated long-term reflections. We evaluate RoCo on five different COPs under both white-box and black-box settings. Experimental results demonstrate that RoCo achieves superior performance, consistently generating competitive heuristics that outperform existing methods including ReEvo and HSEvo, both in white-box and black-box scenarios. This role-based collaborative paradigm establishes a new standard for robust and high-performing AHD."

    "abstract": "Prevalence surveys are routinely used to monitor the effectiveness of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes for controlling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We propose a decay-adjusted spatio-temporal (DAST) model that explicitly accounts for the time-varying impact of MDA on NTD prevalence, providing a flexible and interpretable framework for estimating intervention effects from sparse survey data. Using case studies on soil-transmitted helminths and lymphatic filariasis, we show that DAST offers a practical alternative to standard geostatistical models when the objective includes quantifying MDA impact and supporting short-term programmatic forecasting. We also discuss extensions and identifiability challenges, advocating for data-driven parsimony over complexity in settings where the available data are too sparse to support the estimation of highly parameterised models."

    "abstract": "A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions."

However,existing low-rank sparse based methods still face high computational complexity when dealing with low-contrast small targets and complex dynamic backgrounds mixed with target-like interference. To address this limitation, we reconstruct the data into a fourth-order tensor and propose a new infrared small target detection model based on bilateral tensor ring decomposition, called BTR-ISTD. The approach begins by constructing a four-dimensional infrared tensor from an image sequence, then utilizes BTR decomposition to effectively distinguish weak spatial correlations from strong temporal-patch correlations while simultaneously capturing interactions between these two components. This model is efficiently solved under the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, background suppression capability, and computational speed."

The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment.

    "abstract": "As a key circular economy strategy, remanufacturing allows original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to reduce waste by restoring used products to ``as-new'' conditions. This paper investigates an OEM's optimal remanufacturing business model by incorporating consumer perceptions into price and production quantity decisions. We analyze three alternative models: no remanufacturing, OEM in-house remanufacturing, and third-party remanufacturer (TPR) authorized remanufacturing. We extend the authorization with a two-part tariff contract and consider a stochastic market size. Through a numerical approach, we optimize price and quantity decisions based on consumer perceptions and develop a hierarchical decision roadmap to guide model selection. Our findings show that when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is high, OEM in-house remanufacturing is most profitable and reduces environmental impacts, but generally leads to a market dominated by remanufactured products. In contrast, when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is moderate and TPR remanufacturing significantly increases the perceived value of new products, the TPR-authorized remanufacturing is most profitable. It typically boosts total market sales, but accordingly increases environmental impacts. In addition, sensitivity analysis indicates that two-part authorization contracts are more advanced in meeting stringent environmental requirements than one-part contracts. Incorporating market size stochasticity enhances system profitability while keeping environmental impacts within a limited scope."

However, current VLAs still struggle to produce consistent and precise target-oriented actions, as they often generate redundant or unstable motions along trajectories, limiting their applicability in time-sensitive scenarios.In this work, we attribute these redundant actions to the spatially uniform perception field of existing VLAs, which causes them to be distracted by target-irrelevant objects, especially in complex environments.To address this issue, we propose an efficient PosA-VLA framework that anchors visual attention via pose-conditioned supervision, consistently guiding the model's perception toward task-relevant regions. The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency. Moreover, our framework adopts a lightweight architecture and requires no auxiliary perception modules (e.g., segmentation or grounding networks), ensuring efficient inference. Extensive experiments verify that our method executes embodied tasks with precise and time-efficient behavior across diverse robotic manipulation benchmarks and shows robust generalization in a variety of challenging environments."

    "abstract": "Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $ζ$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $ζ$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $ζ$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors."

    "abstract": "Perceptual similarity scores that align with human vision are critical for both training and evaluating computer vision models. Deep perceptual losses, such as LPIPS, achieve good alignment but rely on complex, highly non-linear discriminative features with unknown invariances, while hand-crafted measures like SSIM are interpretable but miss key perceptual properties. We introduce the Structured Uncertainty Similarity Score (SUSS); it models each image through a set of perceptual components, each represented by a structured multivariate Normal distribution. These are trained in a generative, self-supervised manner to assign high likelihood to human-imperceptible augmentations. The final score is a weighted sum of component log-probabilities with weights learned from human perceptual datasets. Unlike feature-based methods, SUSS learns image-specific linear transformations of residuals in pixel space, enabling transparent inspection through decorrelated residuals and sampling. SUSS aligns closely with human perceptual judgments, shows strong perceptual calibration across diverse distortion types, and provides localized, interpretable explanations of its similarity assessments. We further demonstrate stable optimization behavior and competitive performance when using SUSS as a perceptual loss for downstream imaging tasks."

By combining pump-probe measurements with lattice dynamics modeling based on equation-of-motion approach, we propose that these oscillations arise from a nonlinear coupling between Raman-active and infrared (IR)-active phonon modes, with the latter being resonantly excited by the THz pulses. In contrast, excitation with NIR femtosecond laser pulses does not produce measurable vibrational dynamics, highlighting the unique potential of THz-driven, nonlinear light-matter interactions for the coherent and selective control of structural dynamics in quantum materials."

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point."

While self-tracking devices promise enhanced self-knowledge through quantified data, they also impose particular frameworks that can crowd out other forms of self-understanding and promote self-optimization. Digital technologies increasingly serve as repositories for our autobiographical memories and self-narratives, offering benefits such as detailed record-keeping and scaffolding during difficult periods, but also creating vulnerabilities to algorithmic manipulation. Finally, conversational AI introduces new possibilities for interactive narrative construction that mimics interpersonal dialogue. While LLMs can provide valuable support for self-exploration, they also present risks of narrative deference and the construction of self-narratives that are detached from reality."

Recently, simulating the dynamics of a system of harmonic oscillators (that is, masses and springs) was set forth as another BQP-complete problem defined on exponentially large, sparse graphs. In this work, we establish a direct and transparent mapping between these two classes of problems. As compared to linking the two classes of problems via their BQP-completeness, our mapping has several desirable features: It is transparent, in that it respects the structure of the problem, including the geometry of the underlying graph, initialization, read-out, and efficient oracle access, resulting in low overhead in terms of both space and time; it allows to map also between restricted subsets of instances of both problems which are not BQP-complete; it provides a recipe to directly translate any quantum algorithm designed in the quantum walk paradigm to harmonic oscillators (and vice versa); and finally, it provides an alternative, transparent way to prove BQP-completeness of the harmonic oscillator problem by mapping it to BQP-completeness construction for the quantum walk problem (or vice versa)."

Static models assume fixed mappings to ensure generalization, whereas adaptive models may overfit to transient patterns, creating a dilemma between robustness and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze key factors essential for constructing an effective dynamic mapping for temporal tabular data. We discover that evolving feature semantics-particularly objective and subjective meanings-introduce concept drift over time. Crucially, we identify that feature transformation strategies are able to mitigate discrepancies in feature representations across temporal stages. Motivated by these insights, we propose a feature-aware temporal modulation mechanism that conditions feature representations on temporal context, modulating statistical properties such as scale and skewness. By aligning feature semantics across time, our approach achieves a lightweight yet powerful adaptation, effectively balancing generalizability and adaptability. Benchmark evaluations validate the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal shifts in tabular data."

In this paper, we use the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings to prove the correspondence between an appropriate flat limit of boundary correlators in AdS and Carrollian scattering amplitudes -- massless amplitudes written in position space on the null conformal boundary -- for any number of external states and spacetime dimensions in tree-level, cubic scalar theories. We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators. We then take the flat limit of known formulae for all tree-level boundary correlators of cubic scalar theories in AdS, recovering the Carrollian amplitudes in flat space. In the special case of AdS$_3$, we also make some comments on the flat space limit of spinning boundary correlators."

Most importantly, isobaric systems that differ in their nuclear structure offer valuable insights into the underlying nuclear geometries, making them powerful tools to probe the role of nuclear structure using heavy ion collisions. We study the initial state and evolution of the hot and dense medium formed in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at 200A GeV at RHIC using a relativistic hydrodynamical model. The initial geometry of the two isobaric collisions is found to influence the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced. The sensitivity of photon production, charged particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$) to the initial geometry, including different orientations of the isobaric set have been studied in detail. Significant variations in anisotropic flow of photons and hadrons are observed, highlighting the role of nuclear deformation in shaping final state observables. Moreover, photon anisotropic flow is found to be considerably more sensitive to the initial state than charged particle anisotropic flow, indicating that photon measurements in isobaric collisions have strong potential to constrain initial state modeling and improve our understanding of QGP properties in such systems."

As long as privacy-friendly data treatment proves more expensive or complicated than readily available alternatives, economic imperatives will continue to outrank their legal counterparts. We examined existing legislation with the aim of facilitating mutually beneficial interactions, rather than more narrowly focusing on the prevention of undesired behaviors.

However, as model size increases, the growing memory footprint and inference latency pose significant challenges for practical deployment. Recent studies in large language models (LLMs) show that rotation-based techniques can smooth outliers and enable 4-bit quantization, but these approaches often incur substantial overhead and struggle with row-wise outliers in diffusion transformers. To address these challenges, we propose ConvRot, a group-wise rotation-based quantization method that leverages regular Hadamard transform (RHT) to suppress both row-wise and column-wise outliers while reducing complexity from quadratic to linear. Building on this, we design ConvLinear4bit, a plug-and-play module that integrates rotation, quantization, GEMM, and dequantization, enabling W4A4 inference without retraining and preserving visual quality. Experiments on FLUX.1-dev demonstrate a 2.26$\\times$ speedup and 4.05$\\times$ memory reduction while maintaining image fidelity. To our knowledge, this is the first application of rotation-based quantization for plug-and-play W4A4 inference in diffusion transformers."

Featuring multiple engineering objectives, Hydro-SE is an inherently interdisciplinary domain that integrates scientific knowledge with engineering expertise. This integration necessitates extensive expert collaboration in decision-making, which poses difficulties for intelligence. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their potential application in the Hydro-SE domain is being increasingly explored. However, the knowledge and application abilities of LLMs in Hydro-SE have not been sufficiently evaluated. To address this issue, we propose the Hydro-SE LLM evaluation benchmark (Hydro-SE Bench), which contains 4,000 multiple-choice questions. Hydro-SE Bench covers nine subfields and enables evaluation of LLMs in aspects of basic conceptual knowledge, engineering application ability, and reasoning and calculation ability. The evaluation results on Hydro-SE Bench show that the accuracy values vary among 0.74 to 0.80 for commercial LLMs, and among 0.41 to 0.68 for small-parameter LLMs. While LLMs perform well in subfields closely related to natural and physical sciences, they struggle with domain-specific knowledge such as industry standards and hydraulic structures. Model scaling mainly improves reasoning and calculation abilities, but there is still great potential for LLMs to better handle problems in practical engineering application.

    "abstract": "In this study, we present Colon-X, an open initiative aimed at advancing multimodal intelligence in colonoscopy. We begin by constructing ColonVQA, the most comprehensive multimodal dataset ever built for colonoscopy, featuring over 1.1M+ visual question answering entries across 76 clinical findings and 18 multimodal tasks. Beyond serving as a community-wide data foundation, we further investigate a critical yet underexplored transition in colonoscopy - evolving from multimodal understanding to clinical reasoning: (a) To capture the current landscape of multimodal understanding behaviors, we systematically assess the generalizability of 22 multimodal large language models and examine their reliability under human-induced perturbations. The results reveal that clinical outputs from leading MLLMs remain far from robust and trustworthy. (b) To narrow this gap, we further explore reasoning-centric intelligence tailored for colonoscopy. Specifically, we curate ColonReason, a clinically grounded reasoning dataset annotated through a multi-expert debating pipeline, and develop ColonR1, the first R1-styled model incorporating task-adaptive rewarding and gradient-stable optimization techniques. Under data-scarce conditions, our ColonR1 achieves 56.61% overall accuracy, outperforming supervised fine-tuning by 25.22%, and sets a new reasoning-enabled baseline for multimodal colonoscopy analysis.

    "abstract": "Visual prompting has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to adapt vision models using lightweight, learnable parameters injected into the input space. However, prior work mainly targets large Vision Transformers and high-resolution datasets such as ImageNet. In contrast, small-image benchmarks like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 remain widely used in education, prototyping, and research, yet have received little attention in the context of prompting. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Multi-Scale Visual Prompting (MSVP)}, a simple and generic module that learns a set of global, mid-scale, and local prompt maps fused with the input image via a lightweight $1 \\times 1$ convolution. MSVP is backbone-agnostic, adds less than $0.02\\%$ parameters, and significantly improves performance across CNN and Vision Transformer backbones. We provide a unified benchmark on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 using a simple CNN, ResNet-18, and a small Vision Transformer. Our method yields consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. We further include ablations on prompt scales, fusion strategies, and backbone architectures, along with qualitative analyzes using prompt visualizations and Grad-CAM. Our results demonstrate that multi-scale prompting provides an effective inductive bias even on low-resolution images."

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a key vulnerability: our failure to anticipate novel viral threats. Moving beyond descriptive virology, we introduce V-Reactor Dynamics (V-Dynamics), a physics-based framework modeling host-virus interaction as a synchronized dual chaotic system. This paradigm predicts viral evolution, immune response, transmission, and virulence through equations governed by the parameter reactivity ($ρ$). It quantifies infection phases, peak ($ρ>0$), plateau ($ρ\\approx0$), clearance ($ρ<0$), transmission, and modality via $ρ/\\ell$ (Reactivity/Generation time). Retrospectively, it correctly predicted SARS-CoV-2's higher transmissibility versus SARS-CoV's lethality and forecasted Omicron waves, exposing the lockdown-socioeconomic cost trade-off. We introduce measurable constants, viral replication, immune evasion, and drug absorption cross sections, derived from in vitro virion interactions. These quantum mechanical analogues relate to $ρ$ and $\\ell$, enabling pre-outbreak predictive surveillance.V-Dynamics reveals a duality: microscopic chaos in viral production and macroscopic chaos in population transmission, linked by a scaling law. The sign of $ρ$, tied to the Lyapunov Exponent, dictates pandemic trajectory ($ρ>0$ for outbreak, $ρ<0$ for termination), offering a control mechanism. By unifying kinetics, cross-scale dynamics, and chaos theory, this framework provides a quantitative roadmap to preempt future pandemics."

While condensed group cohomology is generally a more refined invariant than continuous group cohomology, we show that for a broad class of topological groups, continuous group cohomology with solid coefficients, such as locally profinite continuous $G$-modules, can be realized as a derived functor in the condensed setting. We also revisit cornerstones of condensed mathematics, paying special attention to set-theoretic size issues. To this end, we review a framework for working with accessible (hyper)sheaves on large sites satisfying suitable accessibility conditions and show that the associated categories retain many topos-like properties. Moreover, we generalize identifications of condensed with sheaf cohomology obtained by Clausen and Scholze."

To address these challenges, we propose FFTrainer, a system designed for robust LLM training. FFTrainer leverages surplus network capacity to quickly save and load states, thereby preventing rollbacks and accelerating recovery. Compared with prior checkpointing approaches, FFTrainer reduces recovery time by up to 98% and mitigates GPU utilization loss by up to 68% without hindering normal training."

    "abstract": "Cyber-deception is an increasingly important defensive strategy, shaping adversarial decision making through controlled misinformation, uncertainty, and misdirection. Although game-theoretic, Bayesian, Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning models offer insight into deceptive interactions, they typically assume an attacker has already chosen to engage. Such approaches overlook cognitive and perceptual factors that influence an attacker's initial decision to engage or withdraw. This paper presents a descriptive model that incorporates the psychological and strategic elements shaping this decision. The model defines five components, belief (B), scepticism (S), deception fidelity (D), reconnaissance (R), and experience (E), which interact to capture how adversaries interpret deceptive cues and assess whether continued engagement is worthwhile. The framework provides a structured method for analysing engagement decisions in cyber-deception scenarios. A series of experiments has been designed to evaluate this model through Capture the Flag activities incorporating varying levels of deception, supported by behavioural and biometric observations. These experiments have not yet been conducted, and no experimental findings are presented in this paper. These experiments will combine behavioural observations with biometric indicators to produce a multidimensional view of adversarial responses. Findings will improve understanding of the factors influencing engagement decisions and refine the model's relevance to real-world cyber-deception settings. By addressing the gap in existing models that presume engagement, this work supports more cognitively realistic and strategically effective cyber-deception practices."

We present a rigorous formalization of the sigmoid function, proving its monotonicity, smoothness, and higher-order derivatives. We provide a constructive proof of the UAT, demonstrating that neural networks with sigmoidal activation functions can approximate any continuous function on a compact interval. Our work identifies and addresses gaps in Isabelle/HOL's formal proof libraries and introduces simpler methods for reasoning about the limits of real functions. By exploiting theorem proving for AI verification, our work enhances trust in neural networks and contributes to the broader goal of verified and trustworthy machine learning."

While existing optimal control methods for these systems focus on minimizing average performance, this risk-neutral perspective may allow rare but highly undesirable system behaviors. To account for such events, we instead minimize the cost within a coherent risk measure. Our approach reformulates the coupled dynamics as a stochastic PDE, approximates it by a finite-dimensional SDE system, and applies a gradient-based method to compute a riskaverse feedback controller. Numerical simulations show that the proposed controller substantially reduces the tail of the cost distribution, improving reliability with only a minor reduction in average performance."

Comprising an Image Feature Extractor (IFE) and shallow classifiers (e.g., SVM, MLP, or XGBoost) with model sizes ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 parameters, FeatureLens achieves high detection accuracy ranging from 97.8% to 99.75% in closed-set evaluation and 86.17% to 99.6% in generalization evaluation across FGSM, PGD, CW, and DAmageNet attacks, using only 51 dimensional features.

To overcome these limitations, we propose SELF, a novel intrinsic weight-based fingerprinting scheme that eliminates dependency on input and inherently resists false claims. SELF achieves robust IP protection through two key innovations: 1) unique, scalable and transformation-invariant fingerprint extraction via singular value and eigenvalue decomposition of LLM attention weights, and 2) effective neural network-based fingerprint similarity comparison based on few-shot learning and data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate SELF maintains high IP infringement detection accuracy while showing strong robustness against various downstream modifications, including quantization, pruning, and fine-tuning attacks.

A fault-resilient design is always desirable to make the whole PQC system reliable. We, therefore, propose a) a unified hash engine supporting Sha-3 and Shake that follows a byte-wise in-place partitioning mechanism of the so-called Keccak state, and b) an according fault detection for Keccak state protection exploiting its cube structure by deploying two-dimensional parity checks. It outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoA) regarding area requirements at competitive register-level fault detection by achieving 100% detection of three and still near 100% of higher numbers of Keccak state faults. Unlike SoA solutions, the proposed unified hash engine covers all standard hash configurations. Moreover, the introduced multidimensional cross-parity check mechanism achieves a 3.7x improvement in area overhead, with an overall 4.5x smaller fault-resilient engine design as demonstrated in ASIC and FPGA implementations. Integrated into a RISC-V environment, the unified hash engine with the integrated fault-resilient mechanism introduced less than 8% area overhead. Our approach thus provides a robust and lightweight fault-detection solution for protecting hash functions deployed in resource-constrained PQC applications."

    "abstract": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices enables personalized agents with strong privacy and low cost. However, with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters, single-batch autoregressive inference suffers from extremely low arithmetic intensity, creating severe weight-loading and bandwidth pressures on resource-constrained platforms. Recent in-flash computing (IFC) solutions alleviate this bottleneck by co-locating weight-related linear computations in the decode phase with flash, yet still rely on DRAM for the key-value (KV) cache. As context length grows, the KV cache can exceed model weights in size, imposing prohibitive DRAM cost and capacity requirements. Attempts to offload KV cache to flash suffer from severe performance penalties. We propose KVNAND, the first DRAM-free, IFC-based architecture that stores both model weights and KV cache entirely in compute-enabled 3D NAND flash. KVNAND addresses the fundamental performance challenges of flash under intensive KV cache access by leveraging IFC for all memory-bound operations to reduce data transfer overhead, introducing head-group parallelism to boost throughput, and employing page-level KV cache mapping to align token access patterns with flash organization. In addition, we propose a design space exploration framework that evaluates discrete and compact KVNAND variants to balance weight and KV placement, automatically identifying the optimal design trade-off. These techniques mitigate latency, energy, and reliability concerns, turning flash into a practical medium for long-context KV storage. Evaluations on MHA 7B and GQA 70B LLMs show that KVNAND achieves 1.98\\(\\times\\)/1.94\\(\\times\\)/2.05\\(\\times\\) geomean speedup at 128/1K/10K-token contexts compared to DRAM-equipped IFC designs and addresses out-of-memory failures at 100K context length."

    "abstract": "Accurate marine wind forecasts are essential for safe navigation, ship routing, and energy operations, yet they remain challenging because observations over the ocean are sparse, heterogeneous, and temporally variable. We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors."

Leveraging the mapping between Type-I neurons and the Kuramoto model, we investigate whether the conditions known to induce ES in the Kuramoto model also do so in Type-I neurons. The neurons are coupled through electrical synapses and placed on a scale-free and star networks with complete and partial degree-frequency correlation conditions. Our simulations show ES in networks of Quadratic Integrate and Fire (QIF) neurons, the normal form of Type-I neurons, under weak heterogeneity. We further confirm this phenomenon in networks of Morris-Lecar neurons, in the regime of Type-I excitability, under similar conditions to the QIF neurons. Thus, this work establishes a set of universal conditions that allows ES to arise in Type-I neurons."

While Vision Transformers that leverage shifted window-based self-attention have established new benchmarks in this field, they are often hampered by a critical limitation: their localized attention mechanism struggles to effectively fuse local details with global context. This deficiency is particularly detrimental to challenging tasks such as the segmentation of microtumors and miniature organs, where both fine-grained boundary definition and broad contextual understanding are paramount. To address this gap, we propose HBFormer, a novel Hybrid-Bridge Transformer architecture. The 'Hybrid' design of HBFormer synergizes a classic U-shaped encoder-decoder framework with a powerful Swin Transformer backbone for robust hierarchical feature extraction. The core innovation lies in its 'Bridge' mechanism, a sophisticated nexus for multi-scale feature integration. This bridge is architecturally embodied by our novel Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) decoder. Departing from conventional symmetric designs, the MFF decoder is engineered to fuse multi-scale features from the encoder with global contextual information. It achieves this through a synergistic combination of channel and spatial attention modules, which are constructed from a series of dilated and depth-wise convolutions. These components work in concert to create a powerful feature bridge that explicitly captures long-range dependencies and refines object boundaries with exceptional precision. Comprehensive experiments on challenging medical image segmentation datasets, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor benchmarks, demonstrate that HBFormer achieves state-of-the-art results, showcasing its outstanding capabilities in microtumor and miniature organ segmentation.

    "abstract": "We present Quantum Graph Hash (QGH-256), a novel quantum spectral hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints from message-induced graphs. Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time. The entire pipeline is implemented in Qiskit, and we use a seeded statevector simulator to obtain stable, noise-free results."

    "abstract": "Distinct from attention-based compression methods, this paper presents an information uniqueness driven video compression framework, termed UniComp, which aims to maximize the information fidelity of video representations under constrained computational budgets. Starting from the information-theoretic perspective, we formulate the vision compression as an optimization problem that minimizes conditional entropy (reconstruction error) between retained and full tokens. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of information uniqueness to measure intrinsic redundancy among tokens to link with reconstruction error. Based on uniqueness, we design three modules-Frame Group Fusion, Token Allocation, and Spatial Dynamic Compression-that progressively perform semantic frame grouping, adaptive resource allocation, and fine-grained spatial compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniComp consistently outperforms existing compression methods in preserving essential visual tokens under limited computational budgets, highlighting the pivotal role of information uniqueness in token compression efficacy."

Our hypertopology provides an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on proper metric spaces, and in fact, convergence in the latter implies convergence in the former. Moreover, when restricted to the class of quantum compact metric spaces, our new topology is compatible with the topology of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity. We include new examples of noncompact, noncommutative pointed proper quantum metric spaces which are limits, for our new topology, of finite dimensional quantum compact metric spaces. This article thus provides a first answer to the challenging question of how to extend noncommutative metric geometry to the locally compact quantum space realm."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are employed across a wide range of industrial applications where ultra-low power consumption is a critical prerequisite. At the same time, these systems must maintain a certain level of determinism to ensure reliable and predictable operation. In this view, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) is a communication technology that meets both conditions, making it an attractive option for its usage in industrial WSNs. This work proposes the use of machine learning to learn the traffic pattern generated in networks based on the TSCH protocol, in order to turn nodes into a deep sleep state when no transmission is planned and thus to improve the energy efficiency of the WSN. The ability of machine learning models to make good predictions at different network levels in a typical tree network topology was analyzed in depth, showing how their capabilities degrade while approaching the root of the tree. The application of these models on simulated data based on an accurate modeling of wireless sensor nodes indicates that the investigated algorithms can be suitably used to further and substantially reduce the power consumption of a TSCH network."

This study develops an efficient hybrid metaheuristic to solve the integrated dial-a-ride problem by utilizing electric vehicles to minimize operational costs and customer travel time. Customer transfer inconvenience is restricted by a maximum intermodal transfer time to synchronize demand-responsive buses' arrival and transit departures. The proposed metaheuristic addresses the challenges of integrating demand-responsive vehicle routing and charging operations with fixed-route transit systems with capacitated charging stations and partial recharge. We benchmarked our algorithm against a state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming solver on instances with 10-50 customers and two transit lines. Our approach achieves solutions that are, on average, 23.8% better in solution quality within around 2 minutes, outperforming those obtained by the solver using an 8-hour computational time limit. We evaluate the impact of various system parameters to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results suggest that, from the operator's perspective, while the integrated dial-a-ride service reduces vehicle kilometers traveled, the used fleet size may not necessarily be reduced when ensuring high-quality service for passengers. Moreover, operating the integrated systems is more beneficial in areas with dense transit networks, compared with increases in transit frequency. The findings provide valuable insights for developing integrated dial-a-ride services in practice."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances, autonomous agents often struggle to solve complex tasks in enterprise domains that require coordinating multiple tools and processing diverse data sources. This struggle is driven by two main limitations. First, single-agent architectures enforce a monolithic plan-execute loop, which directly causes trajectory instability. Second, the requirement to use local open-weight models for data privacy introduces smaller context windows leading to the rapid consumption of context from large tool outputs. To solve this problem we introduce RP-ReAct (Reasoner Planner-ReAct), a novel multi-agent approach that fundamentally decouples strategic planning from low-level execution to achieve superior reliability and efficiency. RP-ReAct consists of a Reasoner Planner Agent (RPA), responsible for planning each sub-step, continuously analysing the execution results using the strong reasoning capabilities of a Large Reasoning Model, and one or multiple Proxy-Execution Agent (PEA) that translates sub-steps into concrete tool interactions using a ReAct approach. Crucially, we incorporate a context-saving strategy within the PEA to mitigate context window overflow by managing large tool outputs via external storage and on-demand access. We evaluate RP-ReAct, on the challenging, multi-domain ToolQA benchmark using a diverse set of six open-weight reasoning models. Our empirical results show that RP-ReAct achieves superior performance and improved generalization ability over state-of-the-art baselines when addressing diverse complex tasks across the evaluated domains. Furthermore we establish the enhanced robustness and stability of our approach across different model scales, paving the way for effective and deployable agentic solutions for enterprises."

    "abstract": "Despite dissimilar slip rates, slow earthquakes are faulting as ordinary earthquakes are. It is therefore physically natural that slow earthquakes also cause postseismic motions similarly to ordinary earthquakes, even though coseismic and postseismic slips remain undifferentiated for slow earthquakes. We pursue the slow-earthquake postseismicity based on the analysis of a fault slip beneath the Bungo Channel, the westernmost region of the Nankai Trough subduction zone in southwestern Japan. Its 2010 long-term slow slip event (SSE) was mispredicted by physics-based models, which concludes that the initial acceleration of this SSE was too abrupt for a slow variant of a fault rupture. We identify that a mispredicted GNSS signal evolves logarithmically in time, preceded by minor signals that evolve exponentially, lasting about two years west and about half a year east. By performing sparse inverse modeling on the GNSS, we have estimated that exponential slips occur at the same depth, bracketing a logarithmic slip that occurs beneath the channel. The regions of exponential slips match repeating slow-slip regions, and deep tremors synchronize exclusively with the logarithmic slip. This source complexity can be explained as a neighboring rupture doublet and its afterslip and aftershocks by the known mechanics of ordinary earthquakes. If slow earthquakes have a dual origin in exponentially nucleating slow rupture and logarithmically decelerating postseismic creep, it is possible to pick the slow earthquake nuclei that could accelerate into megathrust catastrophes."

    "abstract": "Cooking is a sequential and visually grounded activity, where each step such as chopping, mixing, or frying carries both procedural logic and visual semantics. While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration. Additionally, current recipe illustration methods are unable to adjust to the natural variability in recipe length, generating a fixed number of images regardless of the actual instructions structure. To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings. The proposed framework supports scalable, high-quality visual synthesis of complex multi-step instructions and holds significant potential for broad applications in instructional media, and procedural content creation."

Automation is essential, and while Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) offers powerful, label-free quantitative phase imaging (QPI), its inherently noisy and low-contrast holograms make robust autofocus and object detection challenging. We present the design, integration, and validation of a fully automated closed-loop DHM system engineered for high-throughput mechanical characterization of biological cells. The system integrates automated serpentine scanning, real-time YOLO-based object detection, and a high-performance, multi-threaded software architecture using pinned memory and SPSC queues. This design enables the GPU-accelerated reconstruction pipeline to run fully in parallel with the 50 fps data acquisition, adding no sequential overhead. A key contribution is the validation of a robust, multi-stage holographic autofocus strategy; we demonstrate that a selected metric (based on a low-pass filter and standard deviation) provides reliable focusing for noisy holograms where conventional methods (e.g., Tenengrad, Laplacian) fail entirely. Performance analysis of the complete system identifies the 2.23-second autofocus operation-not reconstruction-as the primary throughput bottleneck, resulting in a 9.62-second analysis time per object. This work delivers a complete functional platform for autonomous DHM screening and provides a clear, data-driven path for future optimization, proposing a hybrid brightfield imaging modality to address current bottlenecks."

    "abstract": "Achieving precise alignment between user intent and generated visuals remains a central challenge in text-to-visual generation, as a single attempt often fails to produce the desired output. To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star. Here we show that, under certain conditions, it is possible that the transfer of helium leads to a common envelope (CE) engulfing the system, similar to the common-envelope wind model proposed by Meng \\& Podsiadlowski (2017). If in such a helium common-envelope wind (HeCEW) model the initial white dwarf (WD) mass is larger than 1.1 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$ and the helium star more massive than 1.8 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$, the mass of a helium CE can be larger than 0.3 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$ prior to supernova explosion. The CE mass heavily depends on the initial parameters of the binary system. A dynamical CE ejection event could occur shortly before the supernova, and then our model may naturally explain the properties of SN 2020eyj, specifically the massive He-rich CSM, its dim peak brightness, low ejecta velocity and low birth rate."

To address these challenges, we propose a generalized communication-constrained model to uniformly characterize communication conditions across different scenarios. Based on this, we utilize it as a learning prior to distinguish between lossy and lossless messages for specific scenarios. Additionally, we decouple the impact of lossy and lossless messages on distributed decision-making, drawing on a dual mutual information estimatior, and introduce a communication-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, quantifying the impact of communication messages into the global reward. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach across several communication-constrained benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Most climate trend studies analyze long-term trends as a proxy for climate dynamics. However, when examining seasonal data, it is unrealistic to assume that long-term trends remain consistent across all seasons. Instead, each season likely experiences distinct trends. Additionally, seasonal climate time series, such as seasonal maximum precipitation, often exhibit nonstationarities, including periodicities and location shifts. Failure to rigorously account for these features in modeling may lead to inaccurate trend estimates. This study quantifies seasonal trends in the contiguous United States' seasonal maximum precipitation series while addressing these nonstationarities. To ensure accurate trend estimation, we identify changepoints where the seasonal maximum precipitation shifts due to factors like measurement device changes, observer differences, or location moves. We employ a penalized likelihood method to estimate multiple changepoints, incorporating a generalized extreme value distribution with periodic features. A genetic algorithm based search algorithm efficiently explores the vast space of potential changepoints in both number and timing. Additionally, we compute seasonal return levels for extreme precipitation. Our methods are illustrated using two selected stations, and the results for the US are summarized through maps. We find that seasonal trends vary more when changepoints are considered than in studies that ignore them. Our findings also reveal distinct regional and seasonal patterns, with increasing trends more prevalent during fall in the South and along the East Coast when changepoints are accounted for."

Leveraging the advantages of phase space, we provide a rigorous definition of caustic surfaces as singularities of the Lagrangian submanifold projection and derive explicit expressions for caustic surfaces in convex lens systems. Furthermore, based on singularity theory, we present a complete classification of stable caustic surfaces and establish a correspondence with classical Seidel aberration theory.

Specifically, we consider a scenario where both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite are equipped with edge servers, providing computing services for maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs). Partial computation workloads of MASSs can be offloaded to both UAVs and the LEO satellite, concurrently, for processing via a multi-access approach. To minimize the energy consumption of SAMINs under latency constraints, we formulate an optimization problem and propose energy efficient algorithms to jointly optimize offloading mode, offloading volume, and computing resource allocation of the LEO satellite and the UAVs, respectively. We further exploit an alternating optimization (AO) method and a layered approach to decompose the original problem to attain the optimal solutions. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison with benchmark algorithms."

    "abstract": "Cell state discovery is crucial for understanding biological systems and enhancing medical outcomes. A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two- dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and-error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system, CellScout, in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states."

To enhance targets and suppress backgrounds, we propose the Basis Decomposition Module (BDM) as an extensible and lightweight module based on basis decomposition, which decomposes a complex feature into several basis features and enhances certain information while eliminating redundancy. Extending BDM leads to a series of modules, including the Spatial Difference Decomposition Module (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M), Spatial Difference Decomposition Downsampling Module (SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M), and Temporal Difference Decomposition Module (TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M). Based on these modules, we develop the Spatial Difference Decomposition Network (SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for single-frame ISTD (SISTD) and the Spatiotemporal Difference Decomposition Network (STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net) for multi-frame ISTD (MISTD). SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net integrates SD$^\\mathrm{2}$M and SD$^\\mathrm{3}$M within an adapted U-shaped architecture. We employ TD$^\\mathrm{2}$M to introduce motion information, which transforms SD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net into STD$^\\mathrm{2}$Net.

However, it remains unclear how such low-level mechanical computation reduces the control requirements of the high-level controller. In this study, we implement a hierarchical controller consisting of a high-level neural network trained by reinforcement learning and a low-level variable-impedance muscle coor dination model with mono- and biarticular muscles in monoped locomotion task. We systematically restrict the high-level controller by varying the control frequency and by introducing biologically inspired observation conditions: delayed, partial, and substituted observation. Under these conditions, we evaluate how the low-level variable-impedance muscle coordination contributes to learning process of high-level neural network. The results show that variable-impedance muscle coordination enables stable locomotion even under slow-rate control frequency and limited observation conditions. These findings demonstrate that the morphological computation of muscle coordination effectively offloads high-frequency feedback of the high-level controller and provide a design principle for the controller in motor control."

Existing visual grounding (VG) methods for autonomous vehicles (AVs) typically struggle with ambiguous, context-dependent instructions, as they lack reasoning over 3D spatial relations and anticipated scene evolution. Grounded in the principles of world models, we propose ThinkDeeper, a framework that reasons about future spatial states before making grounding decisions. At its core is a Spatial-Aware World Model (SA-WM) that learns to reason ahead by distilling the current scene into a command-aware latent state and rolling out a sequence of future latent states, providing forward-looking cues for disambiguation. Complementing this, a hypergraph-guided decoder then hierarchically fuses these states with the multimodal input, capturing higher-order spatial dependencies for robust localization. In addition, we present DrivePilot, a multi-source VG dataset in AD, featuring semantic annotations generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-prompted LLM pipeline. Extensive evaluations on six benchmarks, ThinkDeeper ranks #1 on the Talk2Car leaderboard and surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on DrivePilot, MoCAD, and RefCOCO/+/g benchmarks. Notably, it shows strong robustness and efficiency in challenging scenes (long-text, multi-agent, ambiguity) and retains superior performance even when trained on 50% of the data."

By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) powering GRBs."

    "abstract": "Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $α_\\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $α_\\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $α_\\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields."

    "abstract": "Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources."

To integrate spectral and spatial information, we introduce a lightweight FiLM-based fusion module that adaptively modulates frozen spatial features using spectral cues, enabling robust multimodal learning under sparse supervision. Experiments on two recent hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using only the provided sparse training labels. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of diffusion-derived features and spectral-aware fusion. Overall, our results indicate that pretrained diffusion models can support domain-agnostic, label-efficient representation learning for remote sensing and broader scientific imaging tasks."

Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations."

    "abstract": "Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption."

These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values."

We introduce the ViDiC (Video Difference Captioning) task and its corresponding ViDiC-1K dataset, designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to provide fine-grained descriptions of similarities and differences between video pairs. ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques. To ensure reliable evaluation, we propose a dual-checklist framework that measures the accuracy of similarity and difference separately, based on the LLM-as-a-Judge protocol. Experiments on nineteen representative multimodal models reveal a significant performance gap in their comparative description and difference perception abilities.

While graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance by learning expressive representations via message passing, they incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability and deployment on resource-constrained devices. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), offers a lightweight, brain-inspired alternative, yet existing HDC-based graph methods typically struggle to match the predictive performance of GNNs. In this work, we propose VS-Graph, a vector-symbolic graph learning framework that narrows the gap between the efficiency of HDC and the expressive power of message passing. VS-Graph introduces a Spike Diffusion mechanism for topology-driven node identification and an Associative Message Passing scheme for multi-hop neighborhood aggregation entirely within the high-dimensional vector space. Without gradient-based optimization or backpropagation, our method achieves competitive accuracy with modern GNNs, outperforming the prior HDC baseline by 4-5% on standard benchmarks such as MUTAG and DD. It also matches or exceeds the performance of the GNN baselines on several datasets while accelerating the training by a factor of up to 450x. Furthermore, VS-Graph maintains high accuracy even with the hypervector dimensionality reduced to D=128, demonstrating robustness under aggressive dimension compression and paving the way for ultra-efficient execution on edge and neuromorphic hardware."

Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2).

    "abstract": "Can the thermodynamic arrow of time in a single universe be reversed, even temporarily, within semiclassical gravity without invoking additional universes or branches? We address this question in a single, connected spacetime where quantum field theory is coupled to classical general relativity, and where black holes, traversable wormholes, and time-symmetric or retrocausal formulations of quantum mechanics might naively appear to open channels for entropy export or cancellation. After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language. We then introduce a \"Global Entropy Transport\" (GET) framework and derive a sectoral inequality that bounds the net decrease of matter-plus-radiation entropy in terms of changes in horizon area and correlation (mutual-information) terms, assuming the generalized second law and modern focusing and energy conditions. Within this framework, black holes, wormholes, and retrocausal protocols can at most redistribute entropy among matter, radiation, and gravitational sectors and reshape the local pattern of entropy production. They do not, under current semiclassical, holographic, and statistical-mechanical constraints, permit a genuine reversal of the universal thermodynamic arrow in a single connected universe."

MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an elec- tron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code. The simulation demonstrates that MBI occurs even for finite spheres, and high-density compression is still achievable with this setup. It also shows the opti- mal target structure, which maximizes ion flashing."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a bilevel program. To solve this bilevel program, it is generally necessary to transform it into some single-level optimization problem. One approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT conditions to transform the bilevel program as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Another approach is to apply the lower-level Wolfe/Mond-Weir/extended Mond-Weir duality to transform the bilevel program into some duality-based single-level reformulations, called WDP, MDP, and eMDP respectively in the literature. In this paper, inspired by a conjecture from a recent publication that the tighter feasible region of a reformulation, the better its numerical performance, we present three new duality-based single-level reformulations, called TWDP/TMDP/eTMDP, with tighter feasible regions. Our main goal is to compare all above-mentioned reformulations by designing some direct and relaxation algorithms with projection and implementing these algorithms on 450 test examples generated randomly. Our numerical experiments show that, whether overall comparison or pairwise comparison, at least in our tests, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations were always better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations were always the worst ones among six duality-based reformulations, which indicates that the above conjecture is incorrect. In particular, for the relaxation algorithms, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations performed 3-5 times better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations performed 2 times better than the MPCC reformulation."

We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent.

Conversions between different coordinate reference frames are also derived. We compare our model light curves to those from other papers and microlens modeling software, finding good agreement, although with some differences in finite-source models at a ~1% level detectable with upcoming observations from space-based facilities. We also use BAGLE to demonstrate the impact of changing lens mass, lens distance, and blended source flux fraction on photometric lightcurves and astrometric trajectories in preparation for upcoming Gaia data releases and the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and its Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). In particular, we show that Roman GBTDS will detect significant microlensing parallax signals for events that are 2x shorter in duration than from ground-based surveys. Additionally, long-duration events with durations of $\\t_{E,\\odot} >$ 100 days will yield microlensing parallax uncertainties of $σ_{π_E} <$ 0.01 with Roman, enabling confident identification of isolated stellar-mass black holes that can be modeled both astrometrically and photometrically with BAGLE for precise mass determinations. BAGLE is an open-source code and community development is encouraged."

    "abstract": "Logical reasoning is a core challenge in natural language understanding and a fundamental capability of artificial intelligence, underpinning scientific discovery, mathematical theorem proving, and complex decision-making. Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), most current approaches still rely on forward reasoning paradigms, generating step-by-step rationales from premises to conclusions. However, such methods often suffer from redundant inference paths, hallucinated steps, and semantic drift, resulting in inefficient and unreliable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hypothesis-driven Backward Logical Reasoning (HBLR). The core idea is to integrate confidence-aware symbolic translation with hypothesis-driven backward reasoning. In the translation phase, only high-confidence spans are converted into logical form, such as First-Order Logic (FOL), while uncertain content remains in natural language. A translation reflection module further ensures semantic fidelity by evaluating symbolic outputs and reverting lossy ones back to text when necessary. In the reasoning phase, HBLR simulates human deductive thinking by assuming the conclusion is true and recursively verifying its premises. A reasoning reflection module further identifies and corrects flawed inference steps, enhancing logical coherence. Extensive experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HBLR consistently outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency."

Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM. If the vortices are large enough and the halo's rotational axis align with the line of sight, regularly separated brightness anomalies can be produced, providing strong evidence for BEC-ULDM."

These personas represent different levels of medical literacy and information needs, emphasizing the need for targeted, audience-specific summarization. Each summary in PERCS was reviewed by physicians for factual accuracy and persona alignment using a detailed error taxonomy. Technical validation shows clear differences in readability, vocabulary, and content depth across personas. Along with describing the dataset, we benchmark four large language models on PERCS using automatic evaluation metrics that assess comprehensiveness, readability, and faithfulness, establishing baseline results for future research.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel problem setting called Step-by-Step Layered Design Generation, which tasks a machine learning model with generating a design that adheres to a sequence of instructions from a designer. Leveraging recent advancements in multi-modal LLMs, we propose SLEDGE: Step-by-step LayEred Design GEnerator to model each update to a design as an atomic, layered change over its previous state, while being grounded in the instruction. To complement our new problem setting, we introduce a new evaluation suite, including a dataset and a benchmark. Our exhaustive experimental analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches tailored to our new setup demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity."

    "abstract": "A major effort in modern high-dimensional statistics has been devoted to the analysis of linear predictors trained on nonlinear feature embeddings via empirical risk minimization (ERM). Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes. We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails. Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM."

We propose SAFLe, a framework that achieves scalable non-linear expressivity by introducing a structured head of bucketed features and sparse, grouped embeddings. We prove this non-linear architecture is mathematically equivalent to a high-dimensional linear regression. This key equivalence allows SAFLe to be solved with AFL's single-shot, invariant aggregation law. Empirically, SAFLe establishes a new state-of-the-art for analytic FL, significantly outperforming both linear AFL and multi-round DeepAFL in accuracy across all benchmarks, demonstrating a highly efficient and scalable solution for federated vision."

This new family is combinatorially rich and contains as special cases various families of combinatorial objects that are frequently studied in the literature, as is the case of permutations, circular permutations, multipermutations, Stirling permutations, Catalan objects and their generalizations. When permutation flows are decorated with compatible shuffles, they also include the combinatorics of parking functions and their generalizations. This model is geometrically rich. We show that permutation flow shuffles define a family of unimodular triangulations of the flow polytope $F_G(a)$ on $G$ with an integer balanced netflow vector a where only the last entry is negative. As an application we provide a new proof of the Lidskii volume formula of Baldoni and Vergne for this family of polytopes and a reformulation of the same formula where every term is explained by the nature of the combinatorial objects involved. Permutation flow triangulations extend the Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy triangulations that were defined for the case where a=e_0-e_n. We provide a formula for the h^*-polynomial of the flow polytope as the descent enumerating polynomial of permutation flows. The model comes with an order structure induced by intuitive operators on permutation flows which we call the weak order. This order includes as special cases the weak order on permutations, the Tamari lattice, order ideals in Young's lattice, and their generalizations, among others. It was conjectured in 2020 by the three authors, together with Benedetti, Harris, and Morales, that this poset is in general a lattice. This conjecture has been recently established with independent proofs by Bell and Ceballos, and by Berggren and Serhiyenko."

    "abstract": "Video generation has achieved remarkable progress in visual fidelity and controllability, enabling conditioning on text, layout, or motion. Among these, motion control - specifying object dynamics and camera trajectories - is essential for composing complex, cinematic scenes, yet existing interfaces remain limited. We introduce LAMP that leverages large language models (LLMs) as motion planners to translate natural language descriptions into explicit 3D trajectories for dynamic objects and (relatively defined) cameras. LAMP defines a motion domain-specific language (DSL), inspired by cinematography conventions. By harnessing program synthesis capabilities of LLMs, LAMP generates structured motion programs from natural language, which are deterministically mapped to 3D trajectories. We construct a large-scale procedural dataset pairing natural text descriptions with corresponding motion programs and 3D trajectories. Experiments demonstrate LAMP's improved performance in motion controllability and alignment with user intent compared to state-of-the-art alternatives establishing the first framework for generating both object and camera motions directly from natural language specifications."

    "abstract": "In audio signal processing applications with a microphone and a loudspeaker within the same acoustic environment, the loudspeaker signals can feed back into the microphone, thereby creating a closed-loop system that potentially leads to system instability. To remove this acoustic coupling, prediction error method (PEM) feedback cancellation algorithms aim to identify the feedback path between the loudspeaker and the microphone by assuming that the input signal can be modelled by means of an autoregressive (AR) model. It has previously been shown that this PEM framework and resulting algorithms can identify the feedback path correctly in cases where the forward path from microphone to loudspeaker is sufficiently time-varying or non-linear, or when the forward path delay equals or exceeds the order of the AR model. In this paper, it is shown that this delay-based condition can be generalised for one particular PEM-based algorithm, the so-called two-channel adaptive feedback canceller (2ch-AFC), to an invertibility-based condition, for which it is shown that identifiability can be achieved when the order of the forward path feedforward filter exceeds the order of the AR model. Additionally, the condition number of inversion of the correlation matrix as used in the 2ch-AFC algorithm can serve as a measure for monitoring the identifiability."

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is one of the most popular federation chains and is widely used in many fields, such as healthcare, government, and education. However, in practical application scenarios, Fabric faces the challenge of handling a large number of aborted transactions. These transaction failures are primarily caused by read-write conflicts resulting from read-write locks during the execution and validation phases, as well as transaction ordering dependencies in the ordering phase. The frequent occurrence of aborted transactions significantly reduces system throughput, as each failed transaction not only wastes computational resources and network bandwidth but also requires reprocessing. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution called Fabric*, which includes a transaction reordering mechanism, a cache queue mechanism, and a lock-free mechanism. The former two mechanisms are used to abort conflicting transactions early in the ordering phase and to avoid aborting conflicting transactions again. The latter mechanism is used to abort transactions that read obsolete data during the simulation phase. Fabric* reduces abort transactions and increases the throughput of successful transactions in the system. Experimental results show that Fabric* improves throughput by up to about 23.9% and 7.4% over the original Fabric and Fabric++."

    "abstract": "The sensorless control of interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) based on convex optimization makes it difficult to balance low computational complexity, fast convergence speed, and high rotor position estimation accuracy. Aiming at this problem, a unified full-speed sensorless control of IPMSM based on adaptive Nesterov (Ada-Nesterov) convex optimization is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the cost function containing the rotor position is constructed, the convexity of the cost function is analyzed, and the convexity at low speed is excited. Secondly, Ada-Nesterov is proposed to find the minimum value of the constructed cost function to estimate the rotor position. According to the cost function, the learning rate of the Ada-Nesterov is adjusted adaptively to improve the convergence speed under different working conditions. And the Ada-Nesterov only needs to calculate the gradient information, reducing the calculation amount of a single iteration. And it has a near second-order convergence speed, reducing the number of iterations. Therefore, the total execution time of the optimization algorithm is reduced. Then, the minimum value obtained by the Ada-Nesterov is used as the input of the phase-locked loop (PLL) to obtain the estimated speed and rotor position. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the IPMSM drive experimental platform."

The proposed sensor is implemented in a woven textile substrate (cotton), with the sensing element embroidered using silver-plated conductive yarn and the ground plane realized with a homogeneous conductive textile. The sensor is a two-port structure consisting of a 50-Ω matched line loaded with an open-ended stub resonator, the sensitive element, and the transduction mechanism is the change in the electrical length of such stub resonator caused by urine dropping or pouring. The sensor is tolerant to mechanical stress, evaluated by bending it, and it can discriminate 50 μL droplets of urine. It has been found that by considering the magnitude of the transmission coefficient at 2.4 GHz (the resonance frequency of the bare stub resonator) as output variable, the device can distinguish urine volumes below and above 100 μL, the considered onset of early leakage, by setting the trigger threshold to −11.0 dB. This fully textile-based configuration ensures complete flexibility, enhanced mechanical robustness under deformation, and compatibility with washing processes, essential features for wearable healthcare applications."

To address this, this work introduces a fully-analog stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) architecture that directly performs wave-domain beamforming, enabling diagonalization of the end-to-end channel matrix and inherently eliminating inter-antenna interference (IAI) for MIMO OFDM transmission. By leveraging cascaded programmable metasurface layers, the proposed system establishes multiple parallel subchannels, significantly improving multi-carrier transmission efficiency while reducing hardware complexity. To optimize the SIM phase shift matrices, a block coordinate descent and penalty convex-concave procedure (BCD-PCCP) algorithm is developed to iteratively minimize the channel fitting error across subcarriers. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, determining the maximum effective bandwidth and demonstrating substantial performance improvements. Moreover, for a MIMO OFDM system operating at 28 GHz with 16 subcarriers, the proposed SIM configuration method achieves over 300% enhancement in channel capacity compared to conventional SIM configuration that only accounts for the center frequency."

The approach reformulates the problem within the framework of the antenna’s generalized scattering matrix (GSM), expressed in terms of spherical vector wave functions (SVWFs). The mutual interaction between the antenna and the layered structure is modeled through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations that incorporate the exact Fresnel reflection response of the medium, without introducing any simplifying approximations. This formulation dramatically reduces algebraic complexity and enables fast, stable numerical implementation. Excluding the one-time preprocessing required to obtain the antenna’s free-space GSM, each evaluation for a given layered configuration can be completed within milliseconds—achieving several orders of magnitude speed improvement over full-wave solvers such as FEKO, while maintaining virtually identical accuracy. The proposed framework thus provides a powerful foundation for real-time electromagnetic characterization and inverse modeling involving planar layered environments."

In doing so, there are two challenges: 1) how to achieve accurate FoV prediction, and 2) how to provide a flexible bitrate adaption service given the limited storage space of the video server. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive streaming strategy for 360-degree videos that integrates a Transformer-based FoV prediction model with on-demand video transcoding under dynamic wireless network conditions. To strike a balance between user QoE and transcoding overhead, we formulate a QoE-driven system utility maximization problem that jointly optimizes computing resource allocation and bitrate adaptation. Given the dynamic and multi-slot nature of the problem, it is inherently complex. To overcome this, we transform the original problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it using the residual learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of FoV prediction accuracy and utility improvement."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the development of an effective energy management strategy for a grid-connected hybrid energy system consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) array, a battery storage unit integrated with a battery management system (BMS), and the public electricity grid. The proposed strategy relies on a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimally allocate energy between stored solar energy, battery energy, and power from the grid, according to changing operating conditions and adopting an appropriate battery charging and discharging mechanism. The study relied on climate data from Iraq, known for its dry continental climate, which provides a suitable environment for solar energy applications. A multi-objective optimization model was created using GA, taking into account three main criteria: minimizing operating costs, ensuring load coverage, and reducing dependence on the grid. Appropriate weights were assigned to these criteria to achieve balanced system performance. To enhance the accuracy of solar energy production prediction, historical climate data was used. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated in a simulation environment using MATLAB, and performance was analyzed under two different operating scenarios for two different weather conditions, cloudy and sunny. Simulation results showed that the proposed energy management system, based on GA, performed well compared to an operating strategy based on covering electrical loads from the grid during frequent power outages throughout the day. The simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid energy management system (grid-battery-solar) in achieving significant improvements in operational and economic performance. The system successfully reduced unmet load to 0%, decreased total energy costs by 91.96%, and lowered grid dependency by 93.49%. These indicators reflect the system’s ability to ensure near-perfect supply reliability, significantly reduce operating costs, and enhance the role of renewable energy sources as the primary power supply. Furthermore, the results showed a substantial improvement in power system reliability, with the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) decreasing from 33% to 4% under various weather conditions. These findings demonstrate that integrating a genetic algorithm with smart energy storage andmanagement systems is an effective approach to balancing cost, reliability, and sustainability, making the proposed system a promising option for smart home and microgrid applications."

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation, distribution networks increasingly face frequent voltage fluctuations and excessive regulation operations caused by intermittent solar irradiance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a three-layer collaborative control architecture that integrates event-triggered communication and adaptive impedance mechanisms to achieve high-efficiency and robust voltage regulation. The event-triggered communication layer dynamically adjusts neighbor-to-neighbor data exchange according to voltage transients, thereby minimizing redundant communication while maintaining real-time responsiveness. The adaptive virtual-impedance layer tunes coupling parameters in real time based on the short-circuit ratio (SCR), ensuring coordinated damping and voltage stability under both weak- and strong-grid conditions. The historical impedance-matching layer rapidly restores control continuity during communication interruptions or grid-topology changes through indexed retrieval and fast parameter updating. Through hierarchical coordination among the three layers, the proposed framework simultaneously enhances control responsiveness, communication efficiency, and system resilience under abnormal conditions. Extensive simulations based on an IEEE 33-node model verify that the method reduces communication events by 76%, suppresses overshoot by 50%, and decreases steady-state error by 30%, providing a solid technical foundation for the reliable operation of high-penetration distributed PV systems."

However, the existing works have not fully considered the spatiotemporal mismatch between computing power supply and practical traffic distribution, leading to the failure risks or resource wastes. Specifically, the mismatch arises from two aspects, i.e., 1) the competition for the data links between the collaboration inference tasks and communication transmission tasks; 2) the fixed computing power allocation struggles to meet dynamic computing demand. This paper focused on mismatch problem in JCCPNs, and formulated a joint optimization model for inference links and computing nodes. The joint optimization model was theoretically decoupled into two submodels, efficiently addressing interdependencies between links and nodes. Then, we proposed an inference-subgraph driven multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (IsMADRL) algorithm for JCCPN, consisting of two stages. At the first stage, we formulated an inference subgraph based on ordinal potential game (OPG) to separate computing and transmission data flows, ensuring collaborative inference tasks. At the second one, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework is employed on the inference-subgraph to allocate computing power dynamically, meeting the varying traffic distribution. Simulation results show that several MADRL architectures all exhibit excellent adaptability and effectiveness in complex JCCPN."

However, conventional autoencoder-based detectors struggle to capture distinct signal features while suppressing irrelevant fluctuations, particularly under low interference-to-noise ratio (INR) conditions. To address this, we propose a satellite empirical-based autoencoder (SatEAE) that integrates empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a novel Dual-Stream-CATCN-MHAFF autoencoder (DSCMA) architecture. EMD effectively extracts multiscale intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from raw signals. The DSCMA architecture jointly learns fine-grained temporal dynamics and coarse-grained energy distributions from selected IMFs via a dual-stream design. Specifically, a channel-attention-embedded temporal convolutional network (CATCN) is incorporated into one stream to enhance fluctuation feature extraction, and a multi-head attention feature fusion (MHAFF) module is employed to strengthen inter-stream temporal dependencies. In addition, an improved exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)–based dynamic threshold is designed for online detection and enhanced robustness across varying scenarios. Experimental results show that SatEAE significantly increases the probability of detection from 27% to 74.4% at -4 dB INR, outperforming existing methods."

The image is represented by extracting explicit features from these patches as node features and constructing edge connections based on explicit dependencies. However, this explicit graph structure struggles to accurately capture deeper implicit dependencies. For example, at the node-level, implicit relationships include the intra-group consistency of local and global features belonging to the same semantic group and the inter-group distinction of features belonging to different semantic groups. At the graph-level, implicit relationships manifest in whether global consistency of edge connections can be established in the absence of direct edge connection supervision. These aspects are crucial for improving the accuracy of downstream tasks. Therefore, more effective learning of implicit dependencies in vision graph structures remains an area requiring further research. We designed the Discriminative Feature Reorganization (DFR) module to address implicit dependencies at the node-level. This module constructs a loss function using similarity measures between positive and negative sample feature pairs from adjacent layers of the neural network. By adjusting this loss function, the intra-group consistency and inter-group distinction of node-level local and global features can be enhanced. We also designed the Graph Structure Refinement (GSR) module. This module refines the consistency of graph-level implicit relationships of edge connections through interactive supervision of two graphs learned from adjacent layers of the neural network. Experimental results show that ViDR-GNN achieves significant performance improvements in image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks."

Improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under multiple uncertainties. Specifically, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative impact of each uncertainty on specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of the weighted predictions relative to perfect predictions in downstream optimization. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, the proposed WPO framework enables adaptive assessment of uncertainty impacts and joint learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we develop a surrogate model that establishes a direct mapping between the uncertainty weights and the PDPL, where enhanced graph convolutional networks and multi-task learning are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms the traditional predict-then-optimize paradigm, reducing the PDPL by an average of 55% within acceptable computational time."

The challenges of this task mainly stem from three issues: the difficulty of capturing comprehensive spatio-temporal cues, intra-class variations within video sequences, and inter-modality discrepancies between visible and infrared data. Existing methods mainly try to address the modality gap or focus on one of the other aspects, but rarely do they jointly consider these key factors. Motivated by these core challenges, we propose the M3-ReID (Multi-View & Granularity & Modality) method, a unified framework that simultaneously enhances spatio-temporal feature extraction, intra-class discrimination, and cross-modality consistency. Specifically, to capture diverse spatio-temporal patterns, we design a Multi-View Learning module that leverages different spatial and temporal-spatial perspectives to adaptively emphasize diverse key regions and motion cues. To enhance intra-class modeling of each identity, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Representation strategy that optimizes features across both fine-grained frame level and coarse-grained video level by minimizing mutual information among redundant frames while enhancing identity representations. Furthermore, to bridge the visible-infrared gap, we propose a Multi-Modality Alignment mechanism that explicitly aligns metric learning and cross-modality matching goals, transforming features into a unified embedding space with modality consistency and class discrimination. Extensive experiments on benchmark VVI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed M<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>-ReID framework against existing methods."

    "abstract": "Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">vote mechanism</i> to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Understanding how neural systems drive behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the activity of large neural populations is often governed by low-dimensional neural dynamics. While much of the current research has focused on extracting informative and interpretable latent dynamics from individual motor tasks, it remains unclear whether these dynamics are preserved across different motor tasks. This question is particularly critical, as prior experience with a related task can facilitate faster learning in a new task. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (Conformer-VAE) to extract preserved neural latent dynamics across tasks by leveraging the rich spatiotemporal patterns in neural activity. We validate our approach using neural recordings from a rat, which first performed a one-lever pressing task (old task) and subsequently a two-lever discrimination task (new task). By projecting the inferred latent dynamics from both tasks onto a common 2D PCA plane, our results demonstrate that Conformer-VAE effectively captures preserved neural dynamics across tasks, outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, these preserved dynamics enable faster decoder training for the new task by transferring the neural-to-movement mapping learned from the old task. This capability facilitates seamless real-time task switching, offering promising applications for brain-machine interface systems.Clinical Relevance—This work facilitates faster adaptation in brain-machine interfaces by preserving neural dynamics across tasks, offering potential benefits for neuroprosthetics and motor rehabilitation in patients with motor impairments."

    "abstract": "Maglev planar motor (MLPM) is a new kind of 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) motor, which has attracted extensive attention, because it is very promising in precision and ultra-precision manufacturing, especially for semiconductor equipment. However, there is always a model mismatch between the traditional physics-based deduced (TPD) model and the real model of the motor control system, which leads to performance deterioration in designed control strategies. In the paper, a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN) data-driven model is developed to reflect the dynamic characteristics of the MLPM control system accurately, and then, an LSTM-NN-based reference trajectory compensation algorithm is proposed to improve the tracking performance of the system. The corresponding control experiments are carried out and the results show that the developed data-driven model is able to accurately predict the position of the system, validating the accuracy of the model, and the trajectory tracking error is greatly decreased by applying the proposed LSTM-NN-based compensation algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified."

Along-side the augmentation of autonomy and intelligence in UAV control, a series of UAV security issues have emerged. Due to the diversity of UAV types, it is challenging to perform anomaly detection on each type of UAV by constructing a single model. Researchers typically employ data-driven approaches by inputting UAV-related data into neural networks for anomaly detection. To address the scarcity of UAV data, we develop a Transformer-GAN specifically for augmenting multidimensional UAV flight data. By increasing the volume of data, we enhance the predictive capability of deep learning models for UAV flight states. Experimental results demonstrate that after data augmentation, the model’s predictive capability have improved. And it can be used in UAV health status monitoring."

    "abstract": "Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized toxicity properties. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity, to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68% structural validity, demonstrating its potential to generate viable pesticide candidates while balancing toxicity reduction and synthetic feasibility. By integrating machine learning with ecological safety constraints, this work contributes toward safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.Clinical relevance—This work focuses on environmental and public health by leveraging machine learning to design pesticides with reduced toxicity risks, mitigating exposure-related health hazards."

    "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating condition, posing a significant challenge to public mental health globally. Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques, identifying depression remains challenging due to reliance on subjective assessments and diagnostic inaccuracies. These limitations underscore the need for exploring neural biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and treatment strategies. This research addresses the issue by investigating the effective connectivity (EC) patterns in the resting-state Electroencephalography (rsEEG) signals of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) compared to healthy controls (HC). Existing studies primarily focus on functional connectivity (FC), often neglecting the causal interactions be-tween brain regions. To overcome this limitation, we apply the Frequency-Domain Convergent Cross Mapping (FD-CCM) technique, a model-free, nonlinear method capable of capturing EC patterns in the frequency domain. The study reveals that MDD subjects exhibit reduced EC across four major brain regions—frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital—compared to HC participants. Notably, the findings indicate diminished frontal connectivity and altered power density in the delta and alpha frequency bands. Classification results demonstrate that FD-CCM features consistently outperform classical CCM across multiple classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 92.32% with the best-performing ANN classifier. These findings suggest that altered EC patterns are significant biomarkers for MDD, contributing to deficits in cognitive processing, emotional regulation, and sensory integration. The superior performance of the FD-CCM approach highlights its potential for clinical applications in mental health diagnostics."

    "abstract": "Emotion intensity recognition is important for understanding mental states and improving human-computer interaction. Recently, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based spectrogram analysis was explored for emotion classification. However, accurately determining emotion intensity levels remains challenging. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines EEG feature extraction with machine learning classifiers for emotion intensity recognition. EEG signals were collected from 20 participants in a semi-controlled experiment. EEG signals were processed to extract nine time-domain signals, five frequency-domain signals, and spectrograms. These features were applied to support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models. The performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed approach effectively classified emotion intensity, achieving an accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.996 and a kappa coefficient of 0.994 with the CNN+SVM model. The CNN+RF model, optimized for subject-independent prediction, achieved an accuracy of 0.649 and a kappa coefficient of 0.298. Thus, the proposed method can be extended to real-time emotion monitoring in mental health assessments, stress management, and affective computing applicationsClinical relevance— The proposed framework is clinically relevant in mental health assessment because it enables objective emotion intensity recognition from EEG signals. It can aid in detecting emotional distress, monitoring mood fluctuations in patients with psychiatric disorders, and personalizing therapeutic interventions. Real-time implementation can support early diagnosis and intervention of stress-related disorders, thereby improving patient care and well-being."

However, the severe imbalance in the class distribution causes the networks to overfit to the head classes, while failing to adequately model the distribution of the tail class data during image generation, ultimately compromising the quality of the generated images. To solve this problem, we propose a Class Prototype-Driven Diffusion Model (CPDM) to improve class-conditional image synthesis on long-tailed chest X-ray images datasets. To fully extract the features of limited tail classes while avoiding overfitting to head classes, we introduce a Class Prototype Bank, which stores representative feature vectors of each class. Furthermore, by integrating cross-attention mechanisms between image features and class-specific prototypes, CPDM effectively captures fine-grained class features, enhancing both the realism and diversity of the generated images. Experiments show that our CPDM achieves the lowest FID=31.600 and highest IS=2.842, highlighting the effectiveness of CPDM in mitigating class imbalance and data scarcity in chest X-ray imaging. In downstream experiments, the classifier achieves a 17.22% improvement on the mAUC for 14 thoracic diseases when trained on a mixed dataset containing only 1% real images."

While temperature-sensitive electrical parameters (TSEPs) represent a promising solution, their sensitivity to parasitic influences remains problematic. This sensitivity makes their utilization in converter operation difficult as it requires extensive calibration. Previous studies analyzed the influence of parasitics on TSEPs and presented a first suggestion on how to use different trigger levels for the turn-on delay to reduce the susceptibility to the load current level. Nevertheless, only selected influences were tackled. Hence, in this paper we present a method to potentially use the measurement of switching delays at different trigger levels to allow for a differentiation between different parasitic influences, such as temperature, dc-link voltage and load current, during converter operation. This approach has the potential to reduce calibration efforts for TSEPs significantly and enable a wide-spread adoption of real-time condition monitoring in power electronics."

Online internal impedance measurement has gained traction in recent years as an effective diagnostic tool. Recent studies have introduced methods based on broadband perturbations, enabling real-time battery impedance measurement. In these methods, the battery under test is subjected to controlled charge and discharge perturbations, while Fourier techniques are applied to extract impedance information from the measured voltage and current waveforms. However, applying broadband excitations often introduces nonlinear distortions, leading to inaccurate impedance readings. This work presents a simple method to mitigate the effects of nonlinear distortions in real-time battery impedance measurements under a constant-current stress condition.

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) employs brain signals to establish a non-muscular outward channel, representing a key frontier in the clinical care of individuals in MCS, with high potential to enhance communication and quality of life. The P300-based BCIs, which use the P300 ERP as a control signal, are the most investigated to emulate communication in MCS. However, a reliable control by MCS patients of these BCIs still remains matter of question. One major challenge could be the across trials variability of P300 characteristics, possibly related to attentional fluctuations in this population. The trial-by-trial instability of the P300 peak latency, known as latency jitter, negatively impacts classification performance, and an approach to mitigating this issue involves template matching algorithms (e.g. the Adaptive Wavelet Filtering, AWF) which detect and realign the P300 latency at the single-trial level. This study investigated the offline classification performance using Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWLDA) models trained with progressively larger training sets, to discriminate target from non-target stimuli during an active auditory oddball paradigm. Performance from raw and jitter-corrected data, collected from a control group and a group of patients diagnosed as MCS, were compared. Results highlighted the key role of latency jitter correction in the enhancement of performance and classification speed.Clinical Relevance— The findings suggest that jitter correction could improve real-world applicability of P300-BCI systems for individuals with DoC."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel three-dimensional Spatially Precise Activation and Compliant Electrode (SPACE), designed to simultaneously target both intraneural and extraneural regions of peripheral nerves, thereby enhancing spatial selectivity for neuromodulation. The electrodes were fabricated using advanced MEMS techniques on a flexible polyimide substrate. The SPACE electrode features a unique configuration comprising penetration and wrapping components, which precisely target the internal and external regions of peripheral nerves, respectively. This dual-configuration design not only enables broader neural targeting but also enhances post-implantation stability. In vivo implantation tests on rat sciatic nerves demonstrated targeted muscle activation through intraneural, extraneural, and combined stimulation, with distinct muscle responses observed depending on the electrode configurations. By simultaneously targeting both the inner and outer regions of peripheral nerves, the SPACE electrode was demonstrated with better selectivity and stability for building peripheral neural interfaces.

To address this, computational prediction of spatial gene expression from histological sections offers a cost-effective alternative. Existing deep models, however, often fail to exploit the hierarchical and contextual signals embedded in tissue morphology. Here, we propose DenseGOAT, an integrated framework built upon DenseNet121 and Graph Ordering Attention Networks, which adaptively identifies latent molecular patterns encoded in histopathological features. By coupling visual representations with spatial gene profiles, DenseGOAT establishes a robust mapping between image-derived and expression-based modalities. Comprehensive experiments on four representative ST datasets demonstrate its superior accuracy and efficiency in spatial gene expression inference, as well as its ability to reveal biologically meaningful spatial domains and marker distributions within tissue architectures."

Nuclear morphology plays a vital role in identifying early-grade RCC, as nuclear abnormalities such as structural irregularities and heterogeneity are key indicators of malignancy. In this study, analysis of nuclear morphology is done using multifractal analysis to differentiate RCC from normal renal tissue in hematoxylineosin-stained Whole Slide Images (WSI). Nuclear segmentation is carried out using Detectron2, generating grayscale masks of individual nuclei. The multifractal spectrum is extracted using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA), and key multifractal features are evaluated. Results demonstrate that tumor nuclei exhibit a broader multifractal spectrum with higher variability in singularity strength compared to normal nuclei. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in multifractal features (Δα and Δf) between tumor and normal nuclei (p<0.05), indicating increased structural heterogeneity in RCC. These findings highlight the potential of multifractal analysis as a quantitative approach for early-grade RCC classification and automated histopathological diagnosisClinical relevance— This study demonstrates that multifractal analysis of nuclear structure can serve as an objective, automated tool for early RCC detection and grading, potentially improving diagnostic precision and informing patient management."

However, the inherent challenges of echocardiographic imaging, such as low contrast, noise, and motion artifacts, make accurate segmentation difficult. In this study, we propose a Motion-Aware Spatio-Temporal Fusion Memory Network to enhance segmentation performance by effectively capturing spatial structures and temporal dynamics. Specifically, an optical flow estimation network is employed to extract motion information from adjacent frames, which is then fused with spatial features to construct spatiotemporal representations. These representations propagate through the memory network as memory prompts, enabling effective retention of temporal information. Furthermore, we propose a motion memory reinforcement mechanism that leverages predicted masks to explicitly preserve motion information related to the segmented target before storage. Experimental evaluations on the CAMUS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving the most accurate segmentation results in echocardiography videos.Clinical relevance—In this work, a deep learning methodology with motion-aware spatio-temporal fusion and memory mechanisms is proposed for echocardiography video segmentation.

    "abstract": "Integrating deep learning with ubiquitous image sensors has empowered various edge vision applications such as classification, segmentation, and detection. Deploying these data-driven applications requires holistic optimizations, from front-end sensing to back-end processing, within the limited resources of edge devices. While significant advances have been made in the efficient processing of sensory data in the back end with optimizations of learning algorithms (e.g., compression) and development of computing hardware (e.g., accelerators), the energy efficiency of front-end sensors remains significantly limited due to conventional high-fidelity image acquisition and the resulting massive off-chip data transfer.This paper proposes a domain-specific visual acquisition method, LoRASensE, learnable low-rank acquisition in sensors tailored for efficient data-driven edge vision applications. LoRASensE is an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that integrates a learned low-rank compressor into image sensors to acquire compressed features. Specifically, this compressor is optimized alongside downstream vision tasks to ensure end-to-end accuracy and is implemented with efficient analog processing hardware. Our extensive evaluations on real-world datasets across various vision applications demonstrate that LoRASensE can achieve a 12.5× compression ratio with a just 1-b compressor, minimal accuracy loss, and 86.9% energy saving compared to the conventional high-fidelity acquisition. Multi-dimensional comparisons further show that LoRASensE also significantly outperforms existing in-sensor compression methods."

The attention modules within ViTs play a crucial role in modeling spatial relationships between pixels. Although these attention modules enhance the accuracy of ViT models, they also increase computational demands, limiting the deployment of ViTs in edge computing environments. To address this issue, prior research has focused on optimizing ViTs from both software and hardware perspectives. A notable software optimization technique is reducing the image patches involved in attention computations. Two common methods to achieve this are window attention and patch pruning. However, they introduce new challenges for existing hardware platforms regarding attention computation. Therefore, it is essential to develop new hardware modules to simultaneously support pruned attention computations and efficient window shifts. In this study, we introduce an FPGA-based token reduction vision transformer accelerator called TRFPA.

We analyze individual patients using Shapley-based methods like SHAP, GradSHAP and DeepSHAP, and derive global insights for the most important features by aggregating these local techniques.

Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the precision of these methods for sleep stage inference. This study extends the evaluation of a PPG-based deep learning model to a clinical cohort of 134 patients with suspected sleep apnea (SA). These participants, enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial, underwent overnight PSG alongside simultaneous recording of PPG and accelerometer signals using CSEM’s wearable devices, positioned at both the wrist and upper arm. When compared to PSG, the PPG-based deep learning model achieved a median accuracy of 80.8% with a Cohen's Kappa of 0.7 in identifying wakefulness, light sleep (S1 + S2), deep sleep (S3), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages using wrist-worn sensors. A reduction in performance was observed when the device was worn at the upper arm, with accuracy decreasing by approximately 6.2% and Cohen’s Kappa by 10%. Additionally, a lightweight alternative of the model leveraging inter-beat-intervals (IBIs) yielded comparable results at the wrist, with no performance degradation at the upper arm, highlighting its potential for deployment in resource-constrained settings. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of the approach as an accessible complement to PSG for home-based sleep monitoring."

The gradual onset of glaucoma results in patients progressively losing their vision without being consciously aware of the changes. Accurate assessment of POAG severity is essential for timely intervention of permanent vision loss. However, ophthalmologists often disagree on severity classification, as individual thresholds for defining severity can vary. Nevertheless, they tend to reach consensus when comparing the relative severity between paired cases. In this work, we propose a framework to compare and interpret the severity of glaucoma using fundus images using siamese-based severity ranking with pairwise n-hidden comparisons. We additionally propose to use pair-wise sailency map to explain why a specific image is deemed more severe than others. Our findings indicate that the proposed severity ranking model surpasses traditional ones in terms of diagnostic accuracy and delivers promising saliency explanations."

    "abstract": "The four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter provides wide output voltage range and inherent zero-voltage switching (ZVS), making it ideal for high-power-density and high-efficiency applications. However, research specifically targeting the enhancement of its dynamic performance remains limited. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel continuous-control-set model predictive control (CCS-MPC) strategy explicitly designed to achieve enhanced dynamic response while rigorously guaranteeing ZVS operation, which is critical for maintaining high efficiency, reliability, and power density. Experimental validation demonstrates that the effectiveness of the CCS-MPC approach, which achieves an exceptionally fast microsecond-scale transient response and attains a peak efficiency of 98.5%. Crucially, this significant performance improvement is accomplished while keeping the computational complexity comparable to that of conventional PI control."

    "abstract": "The p-median problem has been extensively investigated, resulting in numerous variant models and corresponding algorithms. The aim of this problem is to find the optimal location of sites and their allocation. However, current research lacks exploration into factors encompassing facility reinforcement decisions, intricate cost considerations, prioritized establishment of critical facilities, and reinforcement principles. To address this gap, this paper introduces the p-median problem with priority location and enhancement (PLE-pM problem). Additionally, we propose the modified hybrid binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (MHBPSO), built upon the hybrid binary particle swarm optimization (HBPSO) algorithm framework. The proposed algorithm combines the efficient features of multiple heuristic algorithms. Based on the characteristics of the PLE-pM problem, high-quality initial positions are specially generated, and the components of the original algorithm are redesigned, including: position updating rule based on previous optima, tabu based mutation operator for diversification, and greedy solution repair and local search for position improving. Computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, demonstrating that MHBPSO efficiently finds high-quality solutions for solving the PLE-pM problem."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a mechanical stimulation system designed for chondrocyte cell culture, specifically aimed at applying controlled shear stress to chondrocyte cells grown on a 12-well plate. Understanding the impact of shear stress on chondrocytes requires careful observation of the regulation of key proteins, including collagen type I, collagen type II, and aggrecan. The stimulation system is engineered to deliver intermittent fluid shear stress within the range of 0.3--1 Pa, which is achieved through the movement of a piezoelectric stack actuator. The system accommodates a 12-well cell culture plate and features a 12-probe fluid shear stirrer that operates at a frequency of 30 Hz. During operation, the stirrer exerts pressure on the culture media, inducing oscillatory motion that generates fluid shear stress. To evaluate the performance of the mechanical stimulation system, we experimentally varied the probe displacement at increments of 2.91, 16.19, 28.31, 39.56, and 42.43 µm. The corresponding velocities were measured at 178.6, 1495, 2515, 3741, and 4821 µm/s. These observed displacement and velocity values were then theoretically converted to shear stress, confirming that the generated shear stress falls within the desired magnitude of 0.045 to 1.218 Pa. Thus, the system is capable of effectively producing the necessary fluid shear stress for chondrocyte studies."

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary sounds contain a rich reservoir of vital and pathological information critical for clinical diagnosis. This paper presents a novel approach to cardiopulmonary data capturing with compressive sensing and reconstruction using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture. Applying traditional compressive sensing techniques to cardiopulmonary sounds presents several challenges. Cardiopulmonary sounds are inherently complex, with a substantial variation between captures. The traditional algorithms for compressive sensing rely on signal sparsity, whereas finding a sparse representation domain for cardiopulmonary sounds is a difficult task. Instead of finding a sparse domain manually, we propose training a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network for a pseudo-randomly undersampled set of signals without explicitly enforcing the sparsity concept. In this research, a CNN was trained for pseudo-randomly decimated input signals, evaluating a compression ratio of up to 30. The network is trained for respiratory sounds using the SPRSound dataset and for Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals using the CirCor Digiscope PCG dataset. Both these datasets have been evaluated for signal integrity after reconstruction and delivered promising results. The algorithm achieves reconstruction quality similar to that of previous research with a compression ratio three times higher than that of previous research applied to respiratory sounds. Since the principles of compressive sensing are applied in the sampling stage, the data compression requires no computation in the compression stage, and can therefore easily be implemented in low-cost edge devices.Clinical relevance— This work enables efficient compression of cardiopulmonary sounds, maintaining high signal integrity even at three times higher compression ratios than previous methods applied to respiratory sounds. It supports low-power, portable devices for real-time monitoring, improving accessibility for telemedicine and point-of-care diagnostics in respiratory and cardiovascular conditions."

Eye movements were recorded during smooth pursuit, text reading, and picture description tasks. Results suggest the text reading task, being structured and cognitively demanding, best distinguished CTL from PD and AD, while the motor-oriented smooth pursuit task differentiated PD from PDM. Ablation studies suggest pupil size improved classification accuracy, especially for CTL vs. PD, and binocular data was crucial for distinguishing PD from PDM. This study shows deep learning models can classify NDs using raw eye-tracking data, becoming a potential tool for objective evaluation in neurology and primary care.Clinical relevance—This project illustrates the efficacy of deep learning methods in leveraging patients’ eye movement to accurately predict the presence of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "Attempted copper theft from power stations causes many fatalities and is an increasing concern. There is a trend towards using electric security fencing to protect power stations. However, capacitive and inductive coupling into fence wires from the power lines above has not been studied previously. Therefore, we calculated the capacitively and inductively coupled voltages and currents for different power line heights, angles, voltages, and currents. We restricted the analysis to 3-phase power grids. Varying levels of current imbalance between the 3 phases were included. We concluded that under typical fence placements (i.e. angled with respected to power lines) the induced voltages were less than 15 V, the human perception threshold at AC frequencies. This level is much lower than the AC magnitudes expected to raise cardiac safety concerns. As a result, the use of electric security fences around power substations is safe. We recommend that fence lines should be temporarily connected to ground during installation. The grounding should be removed only after the connection to the low-impedance output of the electric fence energizer.Clinical Relevance— This study addresses the electrical safety of fence wires placed around power distribution lines."

    "abstract": "Urban low-pressure gas pipeline networks, as critical lifeline systems for city energy supply, face various risks and challenges due to the coupling of spatial and temporal factors. These challenges not only impact the safe operation of the pipeline network but also affect the quality of life for urban residents and social stability. Traditional reliability analysis methods fall short in addressing the multidimensional factor coupling and dynamic state changes of lifeline systems. This paper presents a real-time reliability assessment model for gas pipeline networks based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). The model updates event failure probabilities under incident conditions using pipeline failure data and causes, and identifies key factors. By integrating anomaly event data with Bayesian theory, the model dynamically adjusts the failure probabilities of basic events, thereby updating the probabilities of pipeline network failures and associated consequences, enabling dynamic risk analysis. Using a case study of a city’s low-pressure natural gas pipeline network failure, the model predicts the probability of multi-state fault leakage events and assesses the sensitivity of influencing factors. The results demonstrate that this approach overcomes the limitations of traditional risk analysis methods, effectively reflecting the evolutionary characteristics of gas pipeline network failures and their temporal probability changes. It provides a valuable reference for risk analysis and accident prevention in urban underground gas pipeline networks."

    "abstract": "Crawling Wave Sonoelastography (CWS) is a quantitative elastography technique that employs two mechanical actuators to generate an interference pattern within the tissue. Ultrasound imaging is then used to capture the resulting wave fields, and the shear wave speed (SWS) is computed to produce an elastography image. In previous studies, different time-frequency techniques have been employed to estimate the SWS, but some limitations, such as lateral artifacts and blurred SWS maps, were reported. In this paper, a novel approach based on the Fourier Synchrosqueezed Transform (FSST) is presented. To assert the veracity of the results, previous datasets in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms with vibration frequencies between 200 and 360 Hz have been used.

    "abstract": "Torque-dense electric machines are beneficial across a wide range of applications. Unlike conventional three-phase stator windings that can only control a single spatial harmonic field in the airgap, multiphase, “multi-harmonic” windings can independently control multiple spatial harmonics, each corresponding to a different number of pole-pairs. These spatial harmonics can be used to create additional torque, thereby improving the torque-density and the response time by increasing the torque-to-rotor-inertia ratio. The existing literature on torque enhancement is limited to radial flux designs and considers it as a motor drive / control problem of injecting “time harmonic” currents, rather than machine design to control “spatial harmonics”. This paper investigates torque enhancement as a machine design problem in radial flux (RFPM) and axial flux PM (AFPM) machines to i) quantify the torque enhancement limits in terms of the machine design parameters, and ii) identify optimal harmonic current amplitudes to maximize torque density. The paper develops a 7-phase multi-harmonic AFPM and shows that it can achieve up to 33% improvement in torque capability and 65% improvement in torque-to-rotor-inertia ratio relative to an equivalent 3-phase design. Experimental results are provided to validate these findings, making this the first work to demonstrate torque enhancement in AFPM designs."

    "abstract": "Fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions (UC) are routinely monitored during labor using cardiotocogra-phy (CTG). Clinical interpretation of CTG signals often assesses signal coupling patterns to determine fetal responses to uterine contractions. However, their effectiveness is sometimes limited by low-quality recordings. Traditionally, CTG quality is assessed based on signal loss percentage, overlooking the possibility that non-zero signals may still be non-physiological. This study aims to investigate the coupling relationship between non-zero FHR and UC signals and determine its potential as an index for CTG quality assessment. Using a dataset of 271 CTG recordings without signal discontinuities and surrogate data generated through random shuffling, we quantified the association between FHR and UC using the phase coupling index (λ). Our results show that λ values are significantly different before and after data surrogation, confirming that they quantify a meaningful temporal relationship between FHR and UC. Furthermore, we examined the correlation between λ and four established FHR features and found significant associations with the average depth of decelerations (MAD<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dtrd</inf>) and variability (Hurst parameter, H) in both univariate and multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that λ may capture temporal and physiological dynamics between FHR and UC signals and could serve as a potential quality metric for non-zero CTG data.Clinical Relevance—Phase coupling index of FHR and UC may serve as a metric for identifying quality CTG signals, potentially aiding in visual and computerized analysis."

While the boost-derived EDR topology has been previously introduced as a non-isolated DC-DC converter with high voltage gain capability, conventional implementations have been limited to single-input configurations, restricting its applicability in MPCs that require multiple input sources. The proposed topology enables multiple input sources while allowing independent control of each phase, which is essential to achieve distinct control objectives of hybrid input power sources. A modified phase-shifted control strategy is proposed to reduce voltage stress on switching devices and is validated through theoretical analysis and simulations of a 4-phase EDR converter operating under different conditions. Additionally, its bidirectional operation is analyzed and verified through simulation for the 2-phase case."

    "abstract": "To address the poor reconstruction quality in multi-view 3D reconstruction for scenes with weak texture, repetitive texture, and non-Lambertian surfaces, an improved network model based on Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) and Dynamic Multi-Kernel Convolution (DMC) is proposed. Using CasMVSNet as the baseline, GAM is incorporated to enhance feature extraction, while DMC is applied to improve cost volume regularization, thereby optimizing depth prediction accuracy and robustness. On the DTU dataset, the completeness and overall quality are improved by 21.5% and 7.3%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) and valvular heart disorder (VHD) are major categories of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. CAD occurs due to plaque accumulation on the inner walls of the coronary arteries, restricting blood flow to the myocardium and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. VHD refers to dysfunction in one or more heart valves, impairing blood flow between the heart’s chambers or to other systemic organs. Due to the prevalence of CVD, there is a global need for an effective screening tool capable of detecting various CVDs on a mass scale. Both CAD and VHD alter the acoustic signature of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, offering a non-invasive detection method. This study implements a multiclass classification model to differentiate between CAD, VHD, and normal heartbeats, collected from subjects using an innovative wearable multichannel PCG vest. Linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCCs), coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, achieved the highest multiclass subject-level accuracy of 81.53%, with a sensitivity of 85.20% for VHD and 81.47% for CAD. Additionally, a binary classification task between normal and abnormal (CAD and VHD together) heartbeats reported an accuracy of 82.01%. This is the first study to apply multiclass classification across different CVD categories using PCG signals collected with the same hardware."

    "abstract": "With the rising prevalence of mental disorders globally, there is an urgent need for more and more patients to receive early diagnosis and treatment. However, the current diagnostic approach for brain disorders is primarily based on subjective symptom criteria derived from clinical observation, which is both time-consuming and costly. In this study, we developed a deep learning framework that combines Channel-Space Self-Attention-Mechanism and convolutional networks (CSAM-CNN) to discriminate diseased participants from healthy controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which helps clinicians in the early detection and categorization of brain illnesses. Specifically, firstly multimodal neuroimaging data and clinical priors are fused to create a disease-specific brain network. Then, a self-attention mechanism is proposed for obtaining spatial and temporal representations in brain networks. In addition, non-imaging information (age, gender, etc.) is introduced to address the issue of brain biology being ignored in disease classification tasks. Extensive experiments on disease prediction tasks demonstrate that the proposed CSAM-CNN achieves 92 % and 93.94 % classification accuracy on ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) and COBRE (Centre for Biomedical Research Excellence) datasets, respectively. Furthermore, our model can identify brain regions associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). The approach accounts for individual differences and has the potential for application and clinical use in various brain diseases."

In conventional SSSPWM -based single current sensing methods, the phase voltage with the minimum or intermediate magnitude is split to ensure accurate current sensing. However, this approach introduces an additional switching event within two switching cycles, leading to increased switching loss. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved SSSPWM technique that determines the phase for additional switching based on the stator current magnitude, selecting the phase with the smallest current. The proposed method minimizes switching loss while maintaining accurate current reconstruction. Furthermore, current reconstruction dead zone (CRDZ) variation with respect to power factors is analyzed, and potential issues arising from the proposed method are addressed with effective solutions. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through simulation results."

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias constitute a significant subset of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and can lead to severe complications such as stroke, heart failure, and sudden cardiac arrest. Accurate and timely diagnosis of arrhythmias is crucial for effective intervention, yet traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation relies heavily on expert analysis, which can be prone to variability. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown promise in automating ECG analysis. However, existing one-dimensional (1D) approaches often fail to fully capture the spatial and temporal complexities of ECG signals. To address these limitations, we propose two novel two-dimensional representations for 12-lead ECG signals—Recurrence Polar Plots (RPP) and Cross Recurrence Polar Plots (CRPP)—which effectively reflect signal features while capturing the cyclic and directional patterns inherent to different leads. A multichannel neural network model is trained on these 2D maps to classify four major arrhythmia types. Our model achieves high classification accuracies: 84.0% for Atrial Fibrillation (AF), 94.5% for Sinus Tachycardia (ST), 91.5% for Sinus Bradycardia (SB), and 93.5% for Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging complementary information from RPP and CRPP maps in a unified model for robust arrhythmia detection."

Conventional modeling approaches require solving nonlinear four-dimensional inverse functions, which significantly increase the computational burden and are impractical for real-time applications. To address this issue, a partially linearized flux modeling method is introduced based on decomposing the total flux linkage into average and differential components, derived from the rotating dq-axes stator current. In the proposed approach, the flux linkage associated with the average current is modeled using a nonlinear two-dimensional look-up table (LUT) derived from finite element analysis (FEA), while the differential current is approximated through the linearized model. The proposed approach reduces the dimensionality of the flux model and avoids the use of high-order inverse functions. The method captures key physical phenomena such as magnetic saturation and spatial harmonics. The proposed model is validated through simulation and experiments, demonstrating reliable accuracy with reduced computational complexity."

The LV wall was regionally divided according to standard echocardiographic views and modeled for longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain components. Geometric deformations were simulated and animated using patient-derived strain data derived from the literature. Model validation against literature-derived peak systolic strain values demonstrated strong agreement, with minor discrepancies in the basal anteroseptal and apical regions due to anatomical constraints and modeling assumptions. The proposed framework offers a viable alternative for real-time cardiac motion simulation, bridging the gap between physiological fidelity and clinical usability. Future developments will focus on left atrial modeling, paving the way for digital twins that adapt dynamically to patient-specific data for enhanced intraoperative interventional planning and surgical training.Clinical relevance— This study proposes a strain-based left ventricle digital twin that can enhance patient-specific cardiac assessment, providing a non-invasive tool for functional evaluation, surgucal planning and intraoperative guidance."

Palpation is an essential diagnostic method that is widely used to assess a patient’s physical condition, and there are significant benefits to performing it remotely. However, there has been relatively little research on remote palpation, and the few studies that do exist have tended to use robotic manipulators, which come with several challenges such as initial cost, safety, and operability. Therefore, we proposed a form of palpation where nurses or the patient’s family perform the palpation on behalf of the doctor and transmit the sensing results. This study presents the development of a palpation system that can acquire the mechanical properties of the target tissue in real time by touching it with the hands without interfering with the user’s sense of touch. Our system features a simple yet effective configuration, comprising only a force sensor attached to the user’s nail and a depth camera. The results of calibration experiments using urethane gel confirmed that the proposed system can measure Young’s modulus with a mean absolute error of 26.15% when pressed in to produce a displacement of 4 mm. In addition, to apply this system to remote edema assessment, a classification model was created to discriminate edema grade into five levels using sensor data in a dry lab. The results of repeated and nested 10-fold cross-validation confirmed that edema could be discriminated with a median accuracy of 60.57%. This system is expected to provide accurate diagnostic information to doctors in remote areas and to improve the local medical system."

    "abstract": "Time-Up-and-Go (TUG) is a commonly used clinical test to evaluate an individual’s gait and frailty state. By combining TUG data with other knowledge, e.g., nutrition and daily habits, informed decisions can be made to delay the progression of or alleviate chronic diseases, such as Parkinson’s. Scheduling TUG tests in clinics requires assisted transportation and appointment. With the increasingly overloaded healthcare system, recent advances in e-Health provide an alternative solution. Research studies suggest that it is feasible to perform tests at home and automate gait analysis using intelligent software to classify frailty levels in a remote setting. This allows more frequent monitoring, and clinical appointments are made only to patients at higher risk or those in need. However, conducting the TUG test at home comes with challenges. In this paper, we discuss these challenges, e.g., cluttered environment, and propose solutions. In addition, we investigate whether Body Mass Index (BMI) and gender can affect gait measurement. Our experimental results demonstrate that some machine learning models perform better and the choice of input parameters plays an important role in the classification accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that high BMI can be reflected in an individual’s TUG, if a robust machine learning model is deployed, while men and women in general show distinct gait measurements. Based on this finding, different thresholds should be defined when making the frail, pre-frail and healthy assessment."

In this context, implanted MagS, which are widely used to promote bone healing, are investigated. By leveraging their unique ability to respond to external magnetic fields, we demonstrate that MagS degradation, directly linked to bone healing, can be tracked through their microwave response.

    "abstract": "While minimally invasive surgery reduces the physical burden on the patient, the lack of depth perception and the difficulty in grasping the position and morphology of organs make it a burdensome procedure for the surgeon. In particular, when an endoscope is used to secure the field of view, two-dimensional images are used, making it difficult to fully grasp the complex three-dimensional structures and identify the organs. This problem is no exception in the treatment of spinal disorders. In lumbosacral anterolateral intervertebral fusion, which can treat a variety of spinal disorders, the common iliac vein (CIV), a type of vena cava, runs in the vicinity of the operative field. This vein has a fragile, thin wall and carries large volumes of blood at low pressure, which can cause fatal hemorrhage if injured intraoperatively. However, they are often located behind the peritoneum or arteries and are difficult to identify because of their similar redness to the surrounding tissues. This increases the risk of damage caused by surgical instruments during field development and intraoperative manipulation. In this technique, an assistive endoscope is used to secure the field of view. The surgeon compares the 3D construction images (MRI, CT, etc.) taken preoperatively with the actual space to ensure an appropriate surgical route. However, the identification of veins depends on the surgeon's experience, and only a limited number of physicians are able to perform this procedure safely and reliably. Therefore, an intraoperative support system is required to standardize the identification, but such a system has not been established. Therefore, we developed a method for automatic extraction of vein regions in endoscopic images to facilitate identification and reduce the risk of intraoperative injury by visually presenting the common iliac vein to the surgeon."

    "abstract": "Lack of handwriting automatization in childhood can cause difficulties within and outside the school context. Therefore, the objective quantification of the handwriting performance is key. A Smart Ink Pen (SIP) used on paper demonstrated its validity in characterizing primary school children’s handwriting process, although missing information on the handwriting product. To overcome this limitation, a trace reconstruction algorithm was developed, based on the force and IMU signals measured by the SIP. A total of 353 words \"uno\", written in cursive from the BVSCO-3 battery by 50 Italian students of the 5<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup> grade of primary school, was reconstructed. The quality of the reconstructions was validated through an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm (Google Vision), using the scans of the actual traces as a reference. The character recognition rates were 81.02% and 59.49%, the character error rates 21.48% and 47.65%, for scans and reconstructions, respectively. A deeper analysis revealed that 15% of the reconstructions were read in the opposite direction by the OCR algorithm, likely due to a non sufficient sampling rate for the last portion of the words. A characterization of the differences between the good, bad and opposite reconstructions allowed to identify some directions of improvement. An increase of the SIP sampling rate, a better modeling of the thickness of the trace, a finer estimation of the relative distance between the IMU sensor and the tip and the reconstruction of the tip trajectory during in-air movements could improve the trace reconstruction algorithm. In addition, the possibility to leverage transfer learning approaches on the OCR algorithm using the reconstructed traces for additional training could further improve the performances in terms of character recognition rate. However, the preliminary results obtained are promising and highlight the possibility of reconstructing handwriting traces while maintaining the naturalness of the gesture.Clinical relevance— This contribution establishes the possibility of reconstructing handwritten traces from the kinematic and force signals recorded by an ecological sensorized ink pen."

Early detection is essential for slowing the progression of symptoms and improving patient outcomes. Recent advancements in technology have led to the increased application of machine learning for AD detection. In this study, we aim to identify individuals at risk for future AD onset. To this end, we propose a Multi-Attention Gated Multimodal Unit model that integrates Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. We also present an evaluation framework designed to measure the model’s effectiveness in early-stage AD detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline models in recognizing early signs of AD. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability, we employ Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-Cam) heatmaps and attention maps, offering insights into the model’s decision-making process and its ability to detect crucial AD-related features at an early stage."

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonant human body communication (MR-HBC) features ultra-low power consumption under resonance conditions, with flexible electrode configurations that enable contactless communication, making it suitable for various body area network applications. However, the resonance state is susceptible to the influence of different human body, leading to detuning and frequency shifts, which can cause communication interruptions. This paper proposes an adaptive adjustment method to address resonance frequency variations caused by individual differences, locking the resonance frequency by minimizing the reflection coefficient, ensuring that the MR-HBC system maintains high-quality communication resonance across different scenarios. Finite element analysis and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of varying body fat content and different skin conditions, validating the accuracy and effectiveness of the adaptive adjustment system. The results show that resonance frequency fluctuations caused by individual differences are within 1.02 MHz, with a variation of up to 9.3%.Frequency variations result in a maximum increase of 14.53 dB in path loss, with inter-individual path loss differences reaching up to 28.9%. The integration of the adaptive adjustment system resulted in notable improvements, limiting the maximum locking error to 0.031 MHz, achieving an average enhancement of 12.96 dBm, and reducing MR-HBC transmission path loss by an average of 32.57%."

    "abstract": "The accumulation of β-carotene in human skin has been connected to various forms of protection offered by this ubiquitous carotenoid, from the absorption of ultraviolet radiation to the neutralization of reactive oxygen species. These protective mechanisms, in turn, are likely to be associated with the accumulation pathways of this pigment, via the top (epidermal) and/or the bottom (dermal) cutaneous tissues. The differentiation of the distinct accumulation patterns of β-carotene through noninvasive methodologies is still an open problem, however, notably for skin specimens with relatively high levels of constitutive pigmentation. In this paper, we address this open problem by proposing and evaluating three spectral tests based on carotenemia-elicited variations in skin reflectance within the red end of the visible spectrum. Their efficacy is examined using a first-principles in silico experimental framework grounded on measured data for different skin specimens. The outcomes of our investigation indicate that the use of such a spectral testing approach can lead to reliable and cost-effective differentiation assessments of distinct β-carotene accumulation patterns in skin tissues."

Addressing the exigencies of resource provisioning under highly adversarial and uncertain battlefield, we introduced a logistic system model that incorporates the multistate characteristics of the logistic network. Firstly, a multistate network model is formulated to accommodate the dynamic and stochastic nature of logistic system. Subsequently, to address the need for flexibility and diversity in logistic systems, the performance metric of multistate network predicated on disjoint minimal path vectors is proposed. This foundation is then leveraged to assess network resilience across two critical dimensions: temporal resilience and operational resilience. Empirical investigation through case study demonstrated the model’s accuracy in navigating the inherent uncertainties and complexities inherent in dynamic combat theaters, thereby providing a robust data-driven framework for the design and refinement of logistic system."

The system integrates two RGB-D sensors with time-of-flight (ToF) technology and an optical localizer, enabling simultaneous real-time tracking of both the patient and surgical tools. Due to anatomical variations in facial skin, ToF sensors are susceptible to depth inaccuracies, requiring a tailored correction strategy. The proposed method uses the probe’s tip position, tracked by the optical localizer, to estimate parameters for an error model and correct depth inaccuracies. This real-time, patient-specific depth error correction significantly improves both registration and shape sensing accuracy. Validations using three patient mockups demonstrated a 87% reduction in depth errors, with an average fiducial registration accuracy of 2.33±0.23mm and an average shape sensing accuracy of 2.25±0.38mm. These results highlight the potential of patient-specific depth error correction to improve registration accuracy, thereby ensuring reliable and precise guidance, which may improve clinical outcomes in minimally invasive facial osteotomies.Clinical relevance—This method has the potential to enhance the accuracy of real-time guidance in image-guided facial osteotomies by correcting depth errors and improving image-to-patient registration accuracy, thereby contributing to better clinical outcomes and increased patient safety."

This study evaluates different high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) electrode configurations to investigate signal quality for future designs, addressing challenges in sensor variability and noise. By analyzing dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements with HD-EMG arrays placed over the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medial muscles of 4 healthy participants, the research identifies configurations that improve signal quality and enable better integration into future ankle-foot orthoses. The results demonstrate that the electrodes with smaller surface area of sensors provide higher signal-to-noise ratio and more stable signals compared to the larger electrodes with a higher interelectrode distance. Additionally, while printed electrodes tend to offer greater comfort, due to their flexible design, they performed worse in comparison to their conventional counterparts. The study highlights the need for further investigation of alternative printed interfaces and materials, which will allow for smaller and more densely placed electrode pads while retaining the overall malleability.Clinical relevance— The results of this study provide guidance for future HD-EMG system designs for integration into advanced ankle-foot orthoses, which are used in the rehabilitation of mobility problems."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of diaphragm on the sensitivity and bandwidth of electronic stethoscopes. The analyzed system includes the lung, human body, diaphragm, and microphone. A simulation framework was developed using parameters devised from respiratory mechanics, commercial components and practical characterizations. Numerical simulations were compared to experimental data collected with the electronic stethoscope prototype we developed. The predicted pressure at the microphone closely matched the experimental measurements carried out during outpatient visits at the University Hospital of Modena (Italy). All the human subjects involved in these measurements were volunteers and gave their informed consent. Based on the simulation results, we designed a diaphragm optimizing bandwidth and gain. Interestingly, the optimal configuration weakly depends on the damping factor. In fact, bandwidth and gain of the frequency response function of the system are affected by less than 1% if the damping factor is changed over ±3 orders of magnitude around the optimal value. A prototype has been produced in ONYX® material under the optimal configuration. The prototype is 3D-printed in a single block composed of a central disc capturing and transferring vibration waves, a suspension that links the central disc to the outer ring and a joint to fix the diaphragm to the stethoscope body. The predicted mechanical characteristics are Young modulus of 2.4 GPa and density of 1200 Kg/m3.Clinical Relevance— The shortage of general doctors and physicians is a major issue for modern healthcare systems, as well as high facility and maintenance costs, prevent the wide diffusion of advanced medical test laboratories. The development of new and cheap diagnostic tools is crucial to address these challenges. By developing this application and refining the vibrating membranes, which act as the 'ear' of the stethoscope, it will be possible to reliably and early detect pulmonary diseases directly through auscultation. This would eliminate the need for specialized visits, which require professionals not always available in the field, as well as highly expensive equipment that is not universally accessible, particularly in less affluent regions. Recent studies showed that electronic stethoscopes can improve the capability of detecting pulmonary diseases, such as interstitial lung diseases. Indeed, the diaphragm (or membrane) is a fundamental component of stethoscopes and plays a significant role in its performance, although its exact influence on acoustic coupling remains mostly unclear."

This paper presents a 13-level switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SC-MLI) that utilizes minimal hardware, featuring a single DC supply, 11 switches, 2 diodes, and 3 capacitors, with achieving a high voltage gain of six. A distinctive switching ensures capacitor charging in a 1:1:3 ratio with inherent self-balancing. A key problem in MLIs is elimination of dominant lower-order harmonics. This paper employs the Quantum Differential Evolution (QDE) algorithm to compute the optimized switching angles for selective harmonic elimination pulse width modulation (SHE-PWM). QDE solves the nonlinear SHE-PWM equation in less than 20 iterations, showing better tracking efficiency. A 500 W prototype validates the proposed SC-MLI performance under varying loads and modulation indices. The proposed SC-MLI with no additional input inductance and auxiliary circuits minimizes inrush current, reduces component count, weight, and reliance on bulky filters."

Video monitoring offers a practical alternative; however, seizure detection algorithms could learn to associate incidental events with seizure activity, introducing biases during both the training and the testing phases. By incorporating patient tracking into seizure detection algorithms, patients can be isolated within video frames, reducing biases and improving specificity. As no existing object detection models are pre-trained to identify patients as unique class of individuals, a YOLOv8 model was fine-tuned using 1,590 manually labeled frames from 131 patients admitted to our epilepsy monitoring unit, capturing daily activities, seizures, and body occlusions in both daytime and nighttime. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using a grid-search with a five-fold cross-validation on the training and validation set (85% of the data), while 15% was reserved as a held-out test set. Data were split on a patient-wise basis to prevent data leakage across patients. Additionally, a novel post-processing pipeline for videos was developed to further improve performances. The fine-tuned model achieved 97.6% recall and 96.8% precision, detecting patients under diverse conditions. The post-processing pipeline was evaluated on four new seizure videos, correcting 577 out of 580 misclassified or missed detections in these videos. Combined with the novel post-processing step, the proposed pipeline offers a promising tool for enhancing video-based seizure detection.Clinical relevance— This approach reduces misattributions in video-based seizure detection, leading to more reliable, biasfree monitoring.

The PSO algorithm aims to find the best solution within the search space. This study emphasizes the basic background of understanding and applying the PSO algorithm.

The research was based on data from the Iraqi National Company for Chemical and Plastic Industries, a mixed joint stock company and part of the Iraq Stock Exchange. The data was recorded for two years (2016–2017) based on the company's monthly profits from marketing its products in Iraqi dinars.

    "abstract": "Class imbalance is a major challenge in predictive modelling for rare disease outcomes, particularly in large-scale population cohorts. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with imbalanced datasets, leading to biased performance metrics and poor generalisability. This study systematically evaluates multiple approaches to mitigate class imbalance in predicting Multiple myeloma using proteomic and clinical data from UK Biobank. We compare standard classification models (XGBoost and logistic regression) with synthetic resampling (SMOTE), anomaly detection techniques (isolation forests, local outlier factors, one-class SVM, and autoencoders), and a transformer-based foundation model (TabPFN), using standard classification performance metrics. Our results indicate that anomaly detection models generalise better than conventional classifiers (XGBoost and logistic regression), while SMOTE fails to improve, and may actively worsen, predictive performance. To address the precision-sensitivity trade-off, we introduce a sequential XGBoost ensemble classifier (SeqXGB) that prioritises high precision over sensitivity to minimise false positive predictions. Compared with a single XGBoost model, the SeqXGB approach successfully reduces false positives (420 vs 9), but significantly limits sensitivity (0.70 vs 0.15) in held-out test data. Our findings highlight that no single method is universally optimal for addressing class imbalance; rather, model selection should be guided by clinical application, balancing the risks of false positives and false negatives.Clinical relevance— This study highlights the challenges with using machine learning to predict diseases in highly imbalanced large population cohorts and underscores the need to consider clinical purpose (e.g. screening vs diagnosis) when evaluating models."

Currently, Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) has become a mainstream sensor for observing spacecraft, providing crucial information for attitude estimation. This paper proposes a novel method based on ISAR images and prior three-dimensional models. This method calculates loss values by matching key points between ISAR images and model key points, establishing an optimization function to solve for the spacecraft's attitude angles. When the candidate attitude of the geometric model aligns with the true attitude, the loss value from key point matching reaches its minimum. To improve the search efficiency for spacecraft attitude angles, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed. Compared to methods based on target contours, this method leverages key point matching, demonstrating stronger robustness to noise and yielding smaller estimation errors. Experimental results validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Survey questionnaires were employed to gather the necessary data. The findings revealed key characteristics of the demographic profile of the second-year Bachelor of Secondary Education students at Aldersgate College. Most students were female, aged between 19 to 21 years old, and of Ilocano ethnicity, often speaking Iloco. They predominantly came from public high schools and almost half achieved the passing scores on the English proficiency test. Additionally, many students' parents worked as farmers or housewives. The study identified family as a significant influencer of English language proficiency among these students. Despite these, students demonstrated a high level of proficiency across listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. When grouped by sociodemographic profiles, no notable differences emerged in the factors affecting English proficiency levels. Similarly, no significant relationship was observed between English proficiency levels and the influencing factors, regardless of how students were grouped based on their profile variables."

Despite these improvements, challenges persist regarding intraoperative accuracy, safety, and localization of surgical tools. Ultrasound imaging, while widely used for real-time visualization, faces limitations such as artifacts and poor alignment with instruments during procedures. This study presents a preliminary framework for ultrasound-based classification of materials with tissue-like properties using machine learning algorithms. Artificial phantoms constructed from accessible materials and biological tissues were imaged with ultrasound. Extracted image features were preprocessed using Gabor, Tamura, and Hessian filters, followed by statistical parameterization. Classification models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Discriminant Analysis were evaluated using the F1 score, achieving up to 0.8 in classification performance. The results indicate that ultrasound imaging, combined with statistical learning, has the potential to differentiate materials with tissue-relevant properties. This approach may contribute to enhanced intraoperative navigation and real-time tissue characterization. Future work will include dataset expansion, statistical validation, and integration with clinical systems."

The model achieved a test accuracy of 87.5%, demonstrating strong classification performance despite the limited data set. The Monte Carlo Dropout method was incorporated to evaluate the predictive uncertainty, providing valuable insight into the confidence of the model and its ability to detect potential out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. The different confidence levels observed in the training, validation, and test datasets highlight the importance of uncertainty estimation in assessing model reliability and robustness.

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising strategy for targeted cancer therapy, as inhibiting SL partners of genes harboring cancer-specific mutations can selectively eliminate cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Many SL prediction methods are based on supervised learning and have demonstrated strong predictive capability. However, these methods tend to underperform when trained on limited labeled data. Furthermore, existing SL prediction models are typically trained and tested under idealistically balanced class distributions. However, when these well-trained models are applied to real-world scenarios, where severe class imbalance is common and label distribution shifts occur, they often struggle to make accurate predictions. To address these issues, we propose MVCL4SL, a novel synthetic lethality prediction approach which integrates a multi-view neural network with a multi-view contrastive learning strategy. The multi-view features can describe genes comprehensively, and we propose a multi-view contrastive learning strategy to fuse the features, thereby strengthening the model’s robustness and generalization capabilities. Experimental results indicate that MVCL4SL significantly outperforms six baselines across various cell lines, particularly in low-data training scenarios. MVCL4SL also showcases its robustness to a significant label distribution shift from training data. Our code is available at https://github.com/JieZheng-ShanghaiTech/MVCL4SL."

Among the grid impedance estimation methods, the passive method has gained significant attention due to its low THD and high estimation speed without phase inverter system. In other words, it cannot be applied to the single-phase PFC converter of OBC. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method by using the CCF accurately estimates grid impedance for single-phase PFC converters, while achieving high accuracy in various grid impedance conditions. Its configuration and specifications are described. Then, its effectiveness is verified by simulation tests under various grid impedance conditions."

For efficient, safe and gender-free auscultation, we are developing a robotic multi-acoustic sensor array system capable of acquiring auscultatory sounds in the chest and back. Since multiple acoustic sensors are placed for each auscultation position, it is necessary to post-process the acoustic data acquired by each auscultation sensor to generate diagnostic available auscultatory sounds. This study proposes a method to synthesize heart sounds from multiple sensors to enhance clarity. Noise reduction was applied, followed by delay compensation to align heart sound peaks. Weighted synthesis based on peak amplitudes improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Experiments with six subjects showed SNR improvement in all cases, with three subjects achieving over a 3 dB increase. These results confirm the effectiveness of this method in enhancing auscultation sound quality.Clinical Relevance— This method improves robotic auscultation by enhancing heart sound clarity and reducing noise.

    "abstract": "The primary function of grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) is to maintain voltage and frequency/phase angle stability; however, during unbalanced grid faults, IEEE Std. 2800–2022 requires IBRs to inject both positive-and negative-sequence reactive current. Enforcing compliance with this standard could compromise the stability of GFM IBRs under such fault conditions. This paper presents a preliminary transient stability study focused on the power angle stability of GFM IBRs operating in compliance with IEEE Std. 2800 during unbalanced faults. The goal is to assess potential stability issues associated with the standard's current injection requirements under fault ride-through conditions. The results show that injecting positive-sequence current with d-axis priority during unbalanced faults better preserves the power angle stability than the q-axis priority while still enabling negative-sequence current injection. These findings suggest that, to ensure stability, GFM IBRs might need to partially comply with IEEE Std. 2800 by prioritizing positive-sequence current injection along the d-axis."

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements, Breast Cancer (BC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. The management of BC, as well as the patient prognosis, depends on the tumor invasiveness and grade. Definitive classification of both is provided by biopsy and histopathology. However, this process is both invasive and increases delays in the diagnosis. In this study, an algorithm is developed for the automatic detection and sub-typing of BC type as in situ vs. invasive and tumor grading as grade 2 vs. grade 3 from mammographic images and other patient data. Subtraction of temporally sequential digital mammograms and feature-based Machine Learning (ML) were combined to achieve this goal. The methodology involves two main steps: (1) detection of Regions of Interest (ROIs) and (2) classification of the ROIs. The algorithm was developed using a new dataset of 164 images, with precise annotations. Ninety-six image features and 12 epidemiological and personal history features were collected. Eight feature selection algorithms and 10 classifiers were evaluated for identifying the best models. The algorithm achieved 91.2% accuracy and 0.91 AUC for in situ vs. invasive classification, and 92.8% accuracy and 0.92 AUC for tumor grading. These are the first such results reported in the literature. By reducing the reliance on biopsies, the algorithm provides a faster, non-invasive, and accurate tool for the subtyping of BC. When translated to clinical practice, it has the potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency, improve patient outcomes, and lower BC-related mortality rates."

    "abstract": "An LCL-type Grid-Connected Inverter (GCI) can become unstable due to grid resonance caused by other systems connected to the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). Since grid resonance is difficult to estimate, designing a GCI to maintain stability under conditions where grid resonance exists is challenging. This issue can be effectively addressed by properly designing Active Damping (AD) and Passive Damping (PD) to ensure the passivity of the GCI based on passivity theory. PD does not suffer from sampling issues, making it a simple and effective approach to guaranteeing passivity over the full frequency range. However, ensuring passivity solely with PD can lead to unnecessary power losses. This issue can be addressed by incorporating AD to enhance passivity, thereby reducing the passive component size required for PD. This paper proposes a method to enhance the passivity of the LCL-type GCI with Inverter-side Current Feedback (ICF) by applying positive AD using the inverter-side current."

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer, for which early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to improving patient survival rates, and dermoscopy images serve as the primary basis for its diagnosis. However, due to challenges in dermoscopy images of melanoma lesions such as varying lesion sizes, blurred boundaries, and irregular shapes, existing segmentation networks, even lightweight models pursuing maximum efficiency, still have room for improvement in feature extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel melanoma segmentation model, HSA-UNet. This model improves upon the advanced lightweight EGE-UNet architecture by replacing its original GHPA module with a novel Hybrid Synergistic Attention Module (ECA+SimAM), while retaining the GAB module for multi-scale information fusion. The network primarily consists of three core components: an encoder, a decoder, and skip connections. Deep feature extraction in the encoder is handled by our proposed ECA+SimAM module, which first performs macrolevel channel filtering via Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and then utilizes the parameter-free SimAM module for micro-level neuron refinement, forming a coarse-to-fine hierarchical attention paradigm. The skip connection part retains and utilizes the GAB module to efficiently fuse multi-scale information. Experimental results show that on mainstream melanoma segmentation benchmark datasets, HSA-UNet achieves superior segmentation results and evaluation metrics compared to various mainstream segmentation networks, including the original EGE-UNet."

    "abstract": "Auditory neurophysiology has increasingly focused on naturalistic auditory tasks, for example involving continuous speech and music listening. Probing such neural signatures involves relating the sensory input with the corresponding neural signal, for example by utilizing system identification methodologies. The resulting neural indices have advanced our understanding of foundational neural mechanisms, such as auditory attention and prediction, as well as shedding light on language development, impairments impacting auditory communication, and ageing. One key challenge is to determine whether results from a given experiment generalize or are specific to the experimental design. Here, we re-analyze data from a variety of studies on continuous sound listening to test the sensitivity of neural signals to a key experimental design choice: the segmentation of the sound stimulus. We measured the neural tracking of the sound envelope, finding a reduced tracking through the first 20 seconds of a sound segment. The effect was measured in correspondence with the onset of a segment but was unrelated to the duration of the experiment. This phenomenon was consistent across datasets, regardless of whether the stimulus was speech or music, and independent of attention (target vs. masker speech), intelligibility (speech vs. time-reversed speech), and modality (speech vs. audio-visual speech). This result is akin to slow neural habituation effect or short-term habituation (STH) seen in traditional discrete-stimuli event-related (ERP) studies.Clinical Significance—Our findings indicate that the segmentation choice for experiments involving continuous amplitude-modulated sounds affects the envelope tracking measures. This is a very important issue to consider as it can alter the interpretation of existing and future results. Substantial changes in the neural measurements due to that design choice would be undesirable or, at least, important to consider when comparing data from different experiments."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnosis, patient care, and decision support through interactive communication. More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological time-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods embed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits and increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated features extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal approaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs due to LLMs’ limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting continuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for physiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs with well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, our agent powered by OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo model features an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and analytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent’s performance is benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the gold standard for HR estimation. Results demonstrate that our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower error rates and more reliable HR estimations.

This work presents an adaptive spatial and temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.Clinical relevance— This is a method that could be used to inform participants and therapists in life-style interventions with the aim of improving sleep patterns about the participant’s progress."

Nevertheless, the limited availability of annotations, coupled with the intricate nature of lesion characteristics, imposes significant constraints on the model’s representational capacity. The recently developed vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), featuring its unique capability for prompt interaction, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural image segmentation. However, it encounters performance degradation in medical scenarios due to the absence of domain-specific medical knowledge. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel SAM-assisted semi-supervised framework for accurate lesion segmentation, even in scenarios with extremely limited annotations. Concretely, our approach adopts a dual-branch architecture, where each branch incorporates a SAM (ViT-Base) model fine-tuned with adapters. We further design a point prompts generator that utilizes the pseudo-labels from the dual-branch outputs to automatically produce prompts. The generated prompts are then fed into the pre-trained SAM (ViT-Huge) model to produce more refined segmentation masks, which serve as additional supervision for the original outputs of the two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of achieving promising performance with substantial improvements over existing baselines.Clinical RelevanceThe proposed method employs SAM’s unique prompt encoder design and autonomously generates point prompts for unlabeled data, achieving satisfactory segmentation results even in highly annotation-scarce clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Attention is a fundamental cognitive process, and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience challenges in both cognitive and emotional regulation. Although multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks are frequently used to assess attention impairments in ASD, most studies focus solely on behavioral responses and overlook physiological measures such as electroencephalogram (EEG). Moreover, the interaction between cognition and emotion during MOT tasks remains underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by examining cognitive load variations using the Theta/Alpha Ratio (TAR) in 31 ASD and 31 typically developing (TD) children, based on publicly available EEG data. Participants completed three tasks: neutral image viewing (IPAS), one-target 4-disc (MOT4), and one-target 8-disc (MOT8), representing low, intermediate, and high attentional loads, respectively, while listening to happiness and sadness prosodies. For each participant, TAR was calculated, and five EEG features were extracted: averaged TAR across all channels (allTAR) and TAR values from the frontal (fTAR), temporal (tTAR), parietal (pTAR), and central (cTAR) regions. A three-factor ANOVA (emotion types × attention levels × subject groups) was conducted, followed by post-hoc t-tests for multiple comparisons, and correlation analyses were performed between the five EEG features and clinical measures. Results revealed: (1) a significant interaction between attention level and emotional prosody for tTAR; (2) significant main effects of attention level in fTAR and cTAR, but no interaction with emotional prosody; (3) higher allTAR, fTAR, tTAR, cTAR, and pTAR in the ASD group compared to TD; and (4) stronger EEG clinical correlations in the ASD group during MOT-4. These findings confirm visual attention deficits and highlight the interplay between emotion and cognition in ASD, suggesting TAR as a potential biomarker for cognitive load and emotional modulation."

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the principles of information aggregation and multi-layer stacking, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-structured data tasks. However, deeper GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, which weakens node-level discrimination. To address this, skip connections and feature fusion techniques have been introduced, but the manual design of these strategies typically require significant computational resources and expert knowledge. Inspired by neural architecture search (NAS), this paper proposes EGFAS-BD, an evolutionary framework for graph fusion architecture search with a binary-to-decimal encoding-based performance predictor. This is an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based framework specifically designed for graph fusion scenarios. We first construct an expanded search space integrating diverse aggregation and fusion operations to enhance architectural expressiveness. A compact binary-to-decimal encoding scheme is then used to improve information density, reducing storage overhead and simplifying predictor training. Additionally, we introduce an active filling strategy based on core-set selection, which leverages population-level distributions to enhance sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets and three real-world medical graph datasets demonstrate that EGFAS-BD outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods in both search efficiency and generalization performance. Ablation studies further verify that the proposed encoding and prediction strategies significantly accelerate convergence and reduce computational cost."

Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100×. Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">BSTFormer</i>, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention, global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the efficiency of industry – academia – research (IAR) collaboration in industrial design remains challenging under GPU-intensive, real-time simulation environments. Fragmented resource allocation and asynchronous design – simulation feedback often lead to inefficiencies in co-creation. To address this, a three-stage non-oriented, non-radial Network Slack-Based Measure – Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NSBM – NDEA) model is developed, integrating GPU Reallocation Rate (GRR), User Validation Cycles (UVC), and Aesthetic–Functional Integration Score (AFIS) as stage-level indicators. The model quantifies synergy efficiency across 35 IAR consortia in Shandong, China, incorporating carry-over variables and variable returns to scale (VRS) constraints. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses reveal that higher GRR slack significantly reduces Stage-2 efficiency (Spearman ρ = –0.72, 95% CI [–0.81, –0.58], p < 0.01), while human-centered feedback (UVC) and design coherence (AFIS) enhance performance. Bootstrap validation confirms the robustness of efficiency rankings (mean bias < 2.5%). The framework provides a replicable and scalable tool for real-time resource orchestration and performance diagnosis in computational design collaboration. Practically, it offers actionable insights for optimizing elastic GPU scheduling, improving CAE convergence stability, and promoting sustainable, human-centered innovation in Industry 4.0 ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), including myopathy and neuropathy, is essential for initiating effective treatment and mitigating disease progression. Despite advances in machine learning for NMD analysis, existing models often rely on datasets with limited subject diversity, focus on binary classification, and lack clinical interpretability, which limits their applicability. Classification remains challenging due to overlapping electromyographic (EMG) signal patterns, high inter-patient variability, and subjective interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper presents an interpretable deep learning framework for multiclass NMD classification using intramuscular EMG signals. A robust feature set is constructed by combining three statistical feature selection methods with clinically validated descriptors. A hybrid Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short–Term Memory (CNNLSTM) model is proposed to capture both spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in EMG data. To ensure transparency and clinical trust, the model integrates explainability techniques, including Permutation Feature Importance, SHapley Additive exPlanations, Partial Dependence Plots, and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, which provide both global relevance and case-specific diagnostic reasoning. Evaluated primarily on the Mendeley dataset and further validated on the EMGLAB and a private non-invasive surface EMG cohort, the framework achieves 95.83% accuracy, 98.61% area under the curve, and strong agreement scores (Cohen’s kappa: 93.75%, Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 93.82%) with a median inference latency of 59.56 ms per sample. These findings validate the framework as a practical and interpretable tool for near real-time NMD diagnosis, enabling clinically actionable decisions in both highdemand and resource-constrained healthcare settings."

This energy discrimination enables material decomposition (MD) using the X-ray attenuation properties of various materials. In this study, we develop a novel deep learning (DL) framework for MD in SPCCT and compare its performance with recently developed MD methods. Our approach includes three variants of an encoder-decoder network: ISMDNet (Inverse Sampling Material Decomposition Network) with dual-residual blocks, ISMDNet-AT, which incorporates a channel-wise attention mechanism, and ISMDNet-TR, which integrates multiple transformer layers. We developed a unique synthetic image generation method using inverse transform sampling to address the scarcity of spectral CT datasets and the labor-intensive nature of ground-truth annotation. Synthetic images were used to train deep learning (DL) models, which were subsequently validated and tested on real SPCCT images. We conducted two studies, one involving various known materials in a phantom and the other using a biological tissue phantom. The performance of all approaches was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) for MD quality, along with precision and the F1 score to assess the effectiveness of material identification. We compared our DL models’ performance with the state-of-the-art MD methods, including direct inversion (DI), generalized dictionary learning-based image domain (GDLIMD), MARS-MD, U-Net, and InceptNet. Our MD techniques consistently outperform the other MD methods."

GAs provide visual summaries that improve the accessibility and visibility of research findings; however, their manual creation places a burden on researchers without design expertise. To address this issue, three types of prompts were developed and tested for generating GAs. Ten students evaluated 20 faculty-authored papers from multiple disciplines, assessing the GAs based on two criteria: content predictability and interest arousal. The results show that AI-generated GAs significantly enhance content predictability, particularly for papers outside the reader's field, and effectively stimulate interest. Among the prompt types, one consistently yielded higher interest arousal scores. The study also identifies current limitations of AI-generated visuals, including incoherent elements and inconsistent quality. Within the framework of Japan's Open Access Acceleration Program, the authors propose integrating automated GA generation into institutional repositories to support equitable access to scholarly information. This study contributes to the development of scalable, low-cost tools for visualizing scientific content and provides practical insights into prompt design for improving comprehension and engagement."

This study evaluates the thermal performance of twelve custommanufactured two-step surgical drill bit variants compared with standard single-step designs across clinically relevant diameters. Experiments were performed on synthetic bone analogs under controlled drilling parameters, with real-time temperature monitoring using embedded K-type thermocouples. The results demonstrate that two-step drill bits provide a promising design strategy to reduce intraoperative heat generation, thereby decreasing the risk of osteonecrosis and supporting safer and more reliable surgical outcomes."

This paper proposes a method for scientifically dividing circumferential collagen fibers into bundles and obtaining the envelopes of the bound bundles. First, the MicroCT images of the meniscus are preprocessed in order to remove noise. Then features including long and short axes, centroid coordinates, and angle of long axis direction of each circumferential collagen fiber are extracted to construct a matrix. Second, the spectral clustering method is applied to cluster the feature matrix, and then the collagen fiber regions in the image are divided into several clusters. Third, the Gradient Vector Flow field (GVF-Snake) method is used to obtain the envelopes of the bundles. The experiments demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper not only scientifically and reasonably divides the circumferential collagen fibers into bundles according to their internal properties, but also obtains accurate envelopes of each bundle."

However, the distributed and edge-based nature of 5G-MEC presents privacy and security challenges, including data exposure risks. Ensuring efficient manipulation and security of sensitive data at the edge is crucial. To address these challenges, we investigate the usage of threshold secret sharing in 5G-MEC storage, an approach that enhances both security and dependability. A (k,n) threshold secret sharing scheme splits and stores sensitive data among n nodes, requiring at least k nodes for reconstruction. The solution ensures confidentiality by protecting data against fewer than k colluding nodes and enhances availability by tolerating up to n – k failing nodes. This approach mitigates threats such as unauthorized access and node failures, whether accidental or intentional. We further discuss a method for selecting the convenient MEHs to store the shares, considering the MEHs’ trustworthiness level as a main criterion. Although we define our proposal in the context of secret-shared data storage, it can be seen as an independent, standalone selection process for 5G-MEC trustworthy node selection in other scenarios too."

This scheme takes the flight state of UAV agents as input, with SAC generating adaptive heading angles and PID controllers outputting roll angles to achieve attitude correction. We facilitate healthy behavior management by training UAV agents using a dense reward function.

    "abstract": "Early and accurate identification of tissue infarction (stroke core) is crucial for treatment decisions in acute ischemic stroke. While CT angiography (CTA) is widely used and accessible, it lacks standardized methods for core prediction. CT perfusion (CTP) offers improved tissue classification but is limited by higher cost and complexity. This study aims to bridge this gap by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on CTP core maps to differentiate ischemic core from healthy tissue in multiphase CTA (mCTA) images. We retrospectively analyzed acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent both CTP and mCTA (n=99). Two additional datasets with increasing stroke severity - Severe15 and Severe20 - were derived from the base dataset to assess model performance across a range of clinical scenarios (n=58 and n=31, respectively). The CNN was trained using CTP-derived core maps as ground truth and applied to mCTA-based feature maps. Model performance was optimized using cross-entropy loss and evaluated with thresholding analysis. The primary metric was the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), supplemented by various thresholded accuracy metrics and threshold-independent precision-recall curve analysis. The model trained on the base dataset demonstrated reasonable performance in distinguishing ischemic stroke core from healthy tissue, achieving a DSC of 0.43. As stroke severity increased, thresholded accuracy metrics improved or remained consistent, with the Severe20 model achieving a DSC of 0.60. Precision-recall curve analysis further highlighted the tradeoff between DSC and overall model precision. This study demonstrates the potential of leveraging machine learning to enhance stroke imaging accessibility by integrating the core detection capabilities of CTP with the speed and availability of CTA. Future work will focus on optimizing performance for clinical translation and expanding validation to larger datasets.Clinical Relevance—— The model developed in this study provides a starting point for a reliable, data-driven approach to stroke imaging that can enhance equitable access to advanced diagnostics and support more informed clinical decision-making, especially in severe stroke cases."

This method shows limitations in signal quality due to the motion and lighting disturbances, which hinder its application in daily life. This study aimed to develop a novel anti-noise algorithm for the motion and lighting disturbances so as to improve the quality of rPPG signals. This study designs a light interference suppression module and a specular reflection interference suppression module to improve the rPPG system by analyzing the properties of the noise introduced by motion and light disturbances. The light interference suppression module uses log-domain filtering to demodulate and remove the lighting component. The specular reflection suppression module uses weighted least squares Kalman filter to dynamically suppress unpredictable motion artifacts. We used the PURE dataset to verify the proposed algorithm, and evaluated the signal quality by calculating the error in pulse rate estimation. For different unsupervised rPPG extraction algorithms, the results show that the interference suppression module effectively reduces the error of pulse rate estimation. The mean absolute error of the enhanced system employing the CHROM method is 0.6688 bpm, representing a 19.55% reduction compared to the basic system; the root mean square error is 1.2379 bpm, representing a 43.62% reduction; and the correlation improves from 0.9963 to 0.9990. The Bland-Altman plots show that our algorithm can effectively suppress abnormal outliers caused by noise. This study may offer novel insights into the suppression of noise in rPPG signals and will play a role in daily physiological measurement.Clinical Relevance— This study established a denoising algorithm to improve the robustness of rPPG-based non-contact physiological parameter detection in clinical and daily life."

    "abstract": "The safety and privacy of medical devices is critical, as they directly affect the health of users and handle sensitive personal data. Ensuring that these devices meet safety and security standards is essential, especially with the rise of do-it-yourself solutions such as open-source artificial pancreas systems (APSs) for insulin delivery. In this work, we study AndroidAPS, an APS controller written in Kotlin, and propose an approach to detect safety and security issues. We develop a modeling and analysis framework for Kotlin applications that extracts a structural model and supports detecting logging vulnerabilities and ensuring the application of safety constraints. We conduct two experiments. The first examines logging behavior to check for privacy risks. Out of $\\mathbf{3, 0 5 9 ~ l o g g i n g}$ instances, our tool identified 48 sinks that received 144 sensitive flows, with $68 \\%$ precision due to coarse-grained flagging. The second experiment verifies that calculation-related values are validated against safety constraints before being set to the profile. We show that AndroidAPS generally adheres to its safety design properties, but it has one calculation-related value that is not explicitly validated at the plugin level and only partially validated earlier in the flow."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a major contributor to global cancer-related deaths, largely due to diagnoses occurring at advanced stages. Accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules plays a pivotal role in facilitating early detection and timely intervention. To address the limitations of traditional methods that consider only individual CT slices and suffer from high false-positive rates, this work proposes an end-to-end patient-level classification framework for pulmonary nodule malignancy based on a Cosine Similarity-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (CSEGAT). The proposed method utilizes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to derive features from individual slices, which are subsequently employed as node attributes within the constructed graph. Edges are constructed based on both spatial adjacency and cosine similarity, enabling the graph neural network to capture spatial and contextual relationships between slices. Each patient is represented as a graph, and the CSEGAT model is employed for patient-level benign/malignant classification. By introducing a similarity-enhanced attention mechanism, CSEGAT dynamically adjusts edge weights, thereby improving information propagation and classification performance. This method enables end-to-end learning from slice-level feature extraction to patient-level diagnosis, eliminating the need for complex feature engineering while enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing the false-positive rate. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed method attains a peak testing accuracy of 90.85%, accompanied by an average sensitivity of 88.84% and an average specificity of 90.65%. Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that CSEGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, providing a robust solution for pulmonary nodule diagnosis."

We recently developed a robotic system for cycling rehabilitation, the Haptic Cycling Trainer (HaCT), which can provide targeted dynamic assistance and resistance during a cycle, while allowing for dynamic changes in crank arm length. This system can be used, among other possibilities, for passive cycling and potentially improve upon the current administration of this therapy. Here we used the HaCT system to characterize the neuromuscular response to passive cycling with dynamically changing crank arm lengths. We compared the experimental results with those obtained with a controller-based predictive simulation of passive cycling, replicating the experimental conditions. Through the comparison of the experimental and simulation results, we found that passive cycling elicits the stretch reflex activity of the hamstrings and that this activity is modulated by changing the length of the crank arm.Clinical Relevance—This work shed light on the unvoluntary muscular activations related to spinal reflex modulation that can be achieved through passive cycling exercises."

However, studies have shown that the high performance of Sp-AAD relies heavily on eye gaze artifacts rather than actual auditory attention features. For this reason, this study focuses on verifying whether EEG signals contain sufficient discriminative features for attending target speaker identity without eye gaze artifacts. In this study, we proposed an EEG-Mixup data optimization method to suppress trial-specific features in EEG data by adjusting the data distribution and generating soft labels through linear interpolation. In addition, a lightweight EEG-MLP model containing only 2.5k parameters was designed, which showed significant advantages over the latest SOTA model (DenseNet-3D) in cross-trial scenarios. It is shown that the model’s generalization ability can be significantly improved by optimizing the data without increasing the data volume; meanwhile, the lightweight model demonstrates higher computational efficiency and inference speed in specific tasks. This study provides important theoretical and practical references for future optimization applications of BCI systems.Clinical Relevance— This study demonstrates the potential of lightweight EEG-based methods for attending target speaker identity without relying on eye gaze artifacts, providing a foundation for future auditory brain-computer interface systems."

However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain in healthcare due to strict privacy laws and the need for experts to annotate data. This requirement creates a bottleneck when investigating unexplored clinical questions. This study explores the application of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a way to obtain preliminary results from clinical studies with limited sized cohorts. To assess our approach, we focus on an underexplored clinical task: screening subjects for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (P-AF) using remote monitoring, single-lead ECG signals captured during normal sinus rhythm. We evaluate state-of-the-art SSL methods alongside supervised learning approaches, where SSL outperforms supervised learning in this task of interest. More importantly, it prevents misleading conclusions that may arise from poor performance in the latter paradigm when dealing with limited cohort settings.Clinical relevance- This study illustrates how self-supervised learning (SSL) provides robust preliminary studies with minimal labeled data. By leveraging SSL, researchers can assess the feasibility of clinical questions before committing to extensive data collection efforts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that P-AF can be effectively detected from normal sinus rhythm recordings captured by wearable devices. This capability paves the way for scalable population screening, potentially transforming early diagnosis and intervention strategies in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition, yet its neurobiological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Objective neuroimaging biomarkers are urgently needed to support early diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has enabled the investigation of brain network dysfunction in MDD through functional connectivity (FC) analysis. While dynamic FC (dFC) methods, such as the slidingwindow approach, capture time-varying interactions and offer enhanced sensitivity compared to static FC, they often suffer from high dimensionality, redundancy, and insufficient integration of spatial and temporal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-domain feature fusion framework for MDD identification. First, sparse partial correlation (SPC) is employed to estimate sparse and biologically meaningful functional networks, reducing redundancy while preserving direct connectivity. From these networks, graph-theoretical metrics are extracted as spatial features characterizing regional topology, while highlydiscriminative connections are selected for sliding-window dFC analysis to derive temporal features. These complementary spatiotemporal features are subsequently fused using a Dual Autoencoder with Maximum Mean Discrepancy-based Alignment (DualAE-MMD), which aligns the latent distribution of fused representations with a prior embedding to enhance discriminability. The framework is evaluated using nested fivefold cross-validation on a rs-fMRI dataset, demonstrating superior classification performance compared to conventional methods. Our results highlight the potential of integrating sparse network estimation with deep multimodal fusion for uncovering robust neuroimaging biomarkers in MDD."

Experiments show that models struggled on two tasks with noisy data but achieved SOTA performance on the other tasks with clean data. Moreover, general-purpose audio models outperformed a respiratory sound model, highlighting their broader applicability. With gained insights and the released code, we contribute to future research on developing and leveraging foundation models for respiratory and heart sounds.Clinical relevance—This study reveals the practical effectiveness of the publicly available audio foundation models for respiratory and heart sound diagnosis applications."

Scales and questionnaires, traditionally used in clinical contexts, provide valuable information regarding patients’ overall well-being. However, their intrinsic characteristics do not allow continuous symptoms monitoring. The integration of wearable sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms promises to revolutionize health monitoring, providing continuous and pervasive recordings. In this study, we assessed the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the presence of nine common symptoms experienced by cancer patients, using physiological signals and self-rated symptoms in real-world context, i.e. at patient’s home. Features were extracted from electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (TEMP), and accelerometer (ACC) data. A principal component analysis was implemented to merge the extracted features, selecting the first components, describing the 90% of the total variance, to feed three ML algorithms – logistic regression (LogReg), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). A bootstrap approach was used to enhance the robustness of the results. SVM and RF provide consistently better performance compared to LogReg, achieving a better balance across the evaluated performance metrics. Tiredness achieved the highest F1-score (91.68% ± 2.81%) with SVM. Other symptoms such as malaise, drowsiness, anxiety, appetite, nausea and pain, achieved F1-scores above 70%.Despite the limitation of a small sample size and not accounting for the time of the day, these preliminary findings suggest the feasibility of such an approach, having the potential of improving cancer patient care.Clinical Relevance— The integration of wearable devices and machine learning offers a promising solution for continuous psycho-physical symptoms monitoring, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment strategies."

Patients with MACE consistently exhibited higher age, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and elevated troponin and creatinine levels compared to non-MACE patients (p < 0.05). The RF model achieved Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.817 to 0.865, with sensitivity improving from 75.4% at 30 days to 87.6% at 3 years. This study prevents data leakage by carefully defining the model training steps and avoids excessive variable inclusion, providing a more reliable estimation of MACE risk.

However, internal short circuit (ISC) faults pose severe safety risks and may lead to thermal runaway. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel ISC fault diagnosis framework that integrates electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with artificial intelligence. EIS data from three 10Ah SIBs under different states of charge are collected, and the diagnostic importance of each frequency point is quantified to extract key features. The tabular prior-data fitted network (TabPFN) model, well-suited for small-scale tabular data, is then employed to detect ISC faults. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.9% and an AUC value of 0.962. Further analysis reveals that high-frequency impedance (1kHz-10kHz) plays a critical role in fault identification and that the TabPFN model maintains robust performance across varying temperatures. Compared to classical methods such as XGBoost and random forest, the proposed approach delivers superior performance, especially under limited data conditions. These findings confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed framework and highlight its strong potential for enhancing SIB safety in real-world energy storage and transportation applications."

    "abstract": "Olfactory stimuli are particularly potent in triggering experiences of reward because olfactory processing in the brain directly interfaces with memory, emotional and reward-related neural pathways. Past research has focused mostly on evaluating the neural response to odor stimulation across the arousal-valence dimensions, tapping on emotion and hedonic evaluation mechanisms triggered by olfactory cues. Few studies focused on the reward-related evaluation odor stimuli and the related brain mechanisms, particularly in a longitudinal manner. To address this, in the present study participants were exposed to pleasant odor stimuli and asked to indicate their decision on having the stimuli repeated, in three experimental sessions run on consecutive days. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to assess their neural responses to repeated stimuli presentation. Behavioral results indicated that repetitive exposure to some stimuli trigger stimulus-reward associations, and their trajectory is mediated by the rewarding value of the respective odor samples. Functional connectivity analysis and graph theoretic metrics revealed significant differences between low and high-reward stimuli in the β and γ frequency bands, over frontal and temporal regions, which tracked behavioral evaluations. These findings shed light on neural mechanisms involved in reward-related processing of olfactory stimuli during repetitive exposure and demonstrate that EEG can be used to reliably evaluate the reward value of odor stimuli."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the high-frequency harmonic characteristics and suppression methods for five-phase inverters operating under unbalanced conditions. Under balanced operating conditions, high-frequency harmonics and their sideband harmonics caused by switching devices can be effectively suppressed through mutual cancellation between phases. However, when the system operates in an unbalanced state, the sideband harmonics that could previously cancel each other out can no longer be effectively eliminated, introducing more high-frequency components and resulting in more significant high-frequency torque pulsations and electromagnetic noise. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a high-frequency ripple suppression method based on carrier phase shift. By establishing an analytical model for high-frequency ripples under unbalanced conditions, the high-frequency harmonic characteristics under unbalanced conditions is systematically studied. On this basis, a method of calculating the optimal carrier phase shift angle of each phase through a genetic algorithm is proposed to suppress high-frequency ripple. The simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Automating lung sound classification necessitates capturing both local spectral patterns and long-range temporal dependencies, a challenge for traditional models. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models mitigate this limitation but incur high computational costs, rendering them impractical for real-time use in resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight CNN-based Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network integrated with a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) strategy. The CNN-TSA efficiently captures temporal dependencies, while FBS eliminates irrelevant frequency bands, enhancing noise resilience and generalization. Experiments on the SPRSound 2022 dataset show that the proposed approach reduces computational costs by 50% without compromising performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. This efficient framework facilitates reliable real-time lung sound analysis, making it a promising solution for healthcare applications in resource-limited environments."

    "abstract": "In this study, a position sensorless control method is proposed for Dual Three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors in the full speed range, which is an extension from the proposed method for three-phase PMSMs. By utilizing Vector Space Decomposition, two Extended EMF vectors are defined, which are excited by the rotor speed and high-frequency injected signal, respectively, and they are separated into two different coordinates. The voltage vector sum of them can be estimated by a single linear observer in all speed ranges. Compared to the conventional method for three-phase synchronous motors, the high-frequency injected signal in this method does not affect the fundamental signal, even during the middle speed range. In this paper, the observer is configured, and the performance is evaluated in experiments."

    "abstract": "Bioluminescence tomography (BLT), a non- invasive optical imaging technique, enables the quantitative analysis of the spatial distribution of targeted regions in vivo. Despite its high sensitivity, BLT is constrained by the ill-posed property of the inverse problem. To address this, an adaptive online variational Bayesian (AOVB-NGIG) method with a normal-generalized inverse Gaussian (N-GIG) prior is introduced for BLT reconstruction. This prior effectively captures the sparsity and complexity of the signal, making the approximation of the posterior distribution more controllable and achieving an optimal balance between sparsity and morphological preservation. Variational inference is employed to preserve the conjugacy of the prior information, transforming the optimization problem into a convex task by minimizing the variational lower bound. This approach reduces temporal and spatial complexities while maintaining consistency within the same distribution family. To avoid local optima, an adaptive learning rate adjustment method (AdaDelta) is applied, dynamically updating parameters by computing the exponential weighted averages of the squared gradients and parameter update magnitudes. The performance of the AOVB-NGIG method was evaluated through numerical simulation experiments, demonstrating superior accuracy in tumor spatial localization and morphological reconstruction compared to the L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> -norm total variation (L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf> -TV), fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA), and k-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) methods.Clinical Relevance— The performance of BLT reconstruction is significantly enhanced by the proposed AOVB-NGIG method. This improvement establishes a robust foundation for advancing preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical research."

    "abstract": "Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4 to 6 years. BEAM leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation. Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children’s prosocial development."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary disease is prevalent worldwide resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, but most of the world lacks accessible medical imaging for its assessment. Lung ultrasound is a highly accurate and relatively inexpensive tool for diagnosing pulmonary illness, but its deployment is limited by a lack of trained sonographers. Volume sweep imaging (VSI) of the lung circumvents the problem by shifting image acquisition to individuals with minimal medical and ultrasound background by using standardized ultrasound probe sweeps of the chest (recorded as cine loops) based on external body landmarks. However, significant clinical expertise is still needed to correctly interpret and identify the presence of abnormalities in the scan limiting its impact.In this paper, a novel learning-based approach for automated image interpretation of lung ultrasound VSI has been developed to reduce this dependence on experts. Ultrasound B-mode cine loops of sweeps of the right and left posterior lung, acquired with a commercial ultrasound scanner during routine clinical VSI exams, were used for analysis. Two custom hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based deep learning architectures, including one combined with machine learning algorithms, were used to perform binary classification (abnormal/normal) and compared with the ground truth provided by expert radiologists. Moreover, this learning-based approach adopts weak labels during training, where the diagnosis of the entire cine loop is used as the ground truth which is more cost-effective and less time-consuming than labeling each frame individually. Two methods of aggregating the information from individual frames to obtain clip-level predictions were implemented. Experiments were performed to compare the architectures and the aggregation methods and validate their performance against the ground truth. The best performance (accuracy: 91.67%, precision: 92.31%, recall: 85.71%, and F1-score: 88.89%) was obtained for the combined CNN and random forest classifier. The source code is hosted at: https://github.com/timespace22/Lung-Ultrasound-ClassificationClinical Relevance—The results demonstrate potential use of such learning-based approaches for automated image interpretation in lung VSI applications. The method also demonstrates robustness to using the entire ultrasound sweep which may contain extraneous information beyond the desired anatomy as compared to requiring a clinical expert to segment the relevant portion prior to input to the learning-based classifier."

Although multi-modal physiotherapy, an approach that combines manual therapy, exercise therapy and education is the recommended core treatment, many patients continue to face challenges. Adhering to prescribed home exercise programs, staying motivated and performing exercises correctly are amongst the major obstacles faced in the absence of therapist supervision, which can significantly impact treatment outcomes. This pilot study explores the potential to integrate an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled chatbot with a novel electromyography (EMG) device to enhance engagement and performance as part of MSK rehabilitation. Fifteen healthy adults played two versions of a game, one with the AI chatbot and one without, with the device positioned on the forearm to measure Electromyography (EMG) signals and control the game. The AI-enabled game was associated with a statistically significant increase in muscle activity and game performance. However, no statistically significant differences were identified for engagement based on assessments using the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ). These findings suggest that while AI can increase physical engagement and task execution, further investigation is needed to understand the impact on user engagement. This study lays the groundwork for future research on AI-driven home-based MSK rehabilitation.Clinical relevance— These preliminary findings inform the development of a program of work that aims to establish the role of AI for supporting engagement with home-based exercises among patients requiring rehabilitation for MSK conditions."

Conditions such as osteoporosis, which are highly prevalent in this population, further increase both the risk of falls and the severity of resulting injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate a 3-week NeuroMuscolar Taping treatment to improve postural control in 10 older adults (> 65 y.o.) with mild osteoporosis. Electroencephalography (EEG) and center of pressure (CoP) signals were recorded during a sensory orientation task of the Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test before (T0) and after (T1) treatment. Nonlinear analysis using the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) algorithm was performed on both EEG and CoP signals. Changes in HFD EEG and CoP values between T0 and T1 were analysed using linear mixed-effects regression models and their correlation using a latent change score model. At T1, participants showed decreased HFD EEG values in the central brain region (p < 0.001) and increased HFD CoP values (p < 0.05). A negative correlation was observed between changes in HFD EEG and HFD CoP values between T0 and T1 (p < 0.05). The results suggest that older adults may have improved flexibility and adaptability in postural control, as well as better cognitive load management.Clinical relevance— Falls are a major cause of functional impairment in older adults. In Italy, nearly one in ten older adults are prone to falls, which result in hospitalisation in a fifth of cases. This study provides evidence for a feasible intervention that could improve postural control and reduce the risk of falls."

    "abstract": "The Retinal Landmark Alignment and Correction (ReLAC) algorithm is a novel method to mitigate confounding optic disc tilt and torsion in fundus image analysis. It utilizes automated optic disc segmentation and refined fovea localization based on pixel-wise distance regression. ReLAC quantitatively assesses optic disc tilt using the Ovality Index (OI) and rotation angle. Subsequently, a polar coordinate-based realignment algorithm rectifies these distortions to standardize image orientation. Validation on the MyoCUTU-DATA dataset confirmed ReLAC enhances optic disc circularity across varying myopia categories. Following realignment, mean OI consistently decreased across all groups from 1.138 to 1.083 in High Myopia, 1.092 to 1.058 in Myopia, and 1.087 to 1.043 in Non-myopia cohorts. Consequently, the proportion of images falling into the near-circular OI range of 1.0 to 1.1 increased by 36%, while the proportion in the highly elliptical OI range above 1.2 decreased by 80%. ReLAC provides a robust method for refining fundus image analysis by ensuring a more consistently circular optic nerve head representation. This improved circularity enhances the reliability of quantitative image features, offering significant advantages for diverse ophthalmological applications, particularly glaucoma assessment and myopia management."

To provide a realistic overview of a VRFB system, the model incorporates a closed-loop control system for managing the speeds of two centrifugal pumps and an electro-thermal model of the battery stacks, enabling realtime temperature estimation. Furthermore, a two-stage power electronics topology and associated control solution are presented, operating with distinct strategies for interfacing the battery model with the main grid and a local load. Results from simulations demonstrate that the VRFB model is well suited for RT environment, and system can manage power during both charging and discharging cycles, while a SCADA monitor is used to display critical variables for safe, efficient, and reliable operation of the VRFB systems."

Currently, reliability studies on casing hanger primarily focus on the sealing mechanism and individual components, often neglecting the entire system’s reliability. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the sealing mechanism of casing hanger, determining the stress distribution of each component during operation, and elucidating the mechanical properties’ variations under different conditions. Failure conditions for each component are established, and a finite element analysis (FEA) model is developed for key components to evaluate reliability. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify key factors affecting the casing hanger’s performance. Based on FEA data, a multi-state Bayesian network model is constructed to assess the system’s reliability. By employing model inverse inference and causal chain analysis, the most impactful factors contributing to system failure and the most likely failure paths are identified. This comprehensive approach provides a robust framework for understanding and enhancing the reliability of casing hanger systems."

Subsequently, three participants (two healthy and one with a vestibular disorder) completed a single-session perturbation-based balance training (PBT). Balance indicators were assessed using center of pressure (CoP) metrics, including sway velocity, sway area, total power, and mean frequency, extracted from an instrumented Stewart platform. While healthy participants demonstrated postural adaptation across training laps, the vestibular-impaired participant experienced persistent instability, underscoring the need for extended rehabilitation protocols. These findings suggest that VR-integrated PBT may improve postural control in dynamic environments, though further research is required to refine interventions for individuals with sensory deficits.Clinical Relevance — This study introduces a novel VR-integrated PBT system that mimics real-world balance challenges encountered on public transportation.

As chip size continue to grow and time-to-market shortens, the time allocated for the gate sizing process is becoming increasingly limited, which restricts the global exploration capabilities of traditional sizing algorithms. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more powerful algorithm capable of exploring a larger solution space. Reinforcement learning (RL), with its strong learning and decision-making abilities, can surpass traditional algorithms in terms of quality and find better solutions. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based circuit optimizer that leverages RL for global exploration of the solution space to find better solutions. Since circuits can be naturally represented as graphs, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to encode the electrical characteristics of the circuit and aggregate topological information. Compared to the Resizer algorithm in OpenRoad, our reinforcement learning-based approach achieves superior optimization results in terms of total negative slack (TNS) and leakage power across five design cases."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a predictive control method for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) driven by a seven-level Cascaded H-Bridge inverter. The control is based on a Tree-Based Model-Free Predictive Control and an online calculation of reduced Look-Up Tables. The Tree-Based approach selects the optimal Voltage Vector, reducing the number of tested vectors. The online LUTs handle the generation of gate signals, ensuring online battery balancing by selecting the appropriate switching state. This method reduces the controller's computational effort, improves torque control, lowers switching losses, and manages the battery State of Charge. Additionally, the proposed control technique eliminates the dependency on a load model by introducing a Model-Free approach, based on a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to identify the parameters of an Auto-Regressive with Exogenous input (ARX) model. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control for accurate motor control, reduced switching frequency losses, and SOC management."

    "abstract": "Accurate differentiation between tumorous and healthy tissue is critical in oncological surgeries to ensure complete tumor resection while minimizing the loss of healthy tissue. However, tissue heterogeneity and visual impairments inherent in endoscopic procedures significantly limit the accuracy of current visual tissue examination. The use of multi-physical endoscopic sensors and subsequent fusion offers a promising solution. Impedance and waterflow elastography sensors are able to capture distinct electrical and mechanical properties of bladder tissue. Nonetheless, effective fusion of the two sensors requires advanced machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition, necessitating coupled multimodal training data. Addressing the scarcity of coupled multimodal datasets, we develop a comprehensive mathematical tissue model that simulates the effects of varying tumor cell densities on the extracellular matrix (ECM) and individual cells. This model integrates tumor-induced alterations such as cytoskeletal remodeling, ECM cross-linking, and changes in fluid content, thereby generating a multimodal synthetic dataset that closely mimics real tissue behavior. Parameter identification was performed using a combination of real impedance and elastography measurements, enabling the generation of synthetic data that is suitable for transfer learning of neural networks. Validation against real-world measurements demonstrated that the synthetic data closely matched the impedance and elastography measurements corresponding to known tumor cell densities. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic data and sensor fusion in enhancing tissue differentiation and classification. Our approach provides a foundation for multimodal diagnostics, improving intraoperative decision-making and patient outcomes. Future work will focus on refining the model to better capture biological variability and exploiting the generated dataset for pretraining advanced sensor fusion algorithms."

This study also aims to create new techniques to approximate distances using only a singular camera and Yolov5 image classification and then compare it to the performance of a standard ultrasonic sensor. The study utilizes the logic of farther distance becoming small and the function numpy polyfit to analyze the bounding boxes size to approximate the space, and another technique, which is getting the angle of the camera relative to the object and using Trigonometric identity to get the distance of the obstacle. The study measured the distance of these objects, Humans, Bike, Pole, Car and Tripping obstacles. The percent error of the distance measurement and approximation ranges from 0.4%-10.36%."

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition is a promising approach for designing intuitive human-computer interfaces. However, while these systems typically perform well in controlled laboratory settings, their usability in real-world applications is compromised by declining performance during real-time control. This decline is largely due to goal-directed behaviors that are not captured in static, offline scenarios. To address this issue, we use Context Informed Incremental Learning (CIIL) - marking its first deployment in an object-manipulation scenario - to continuously adapt the classifier using contextual cues. Nine participants without upper limb differences completed a functional task in a virtual reality (VR) environment involving transporting objects with life-like grips. We compared two scenarios: one where the classifier was adapted in real-time using contextual information, and the other using a traditional open-loop approach without adaptation. The CIIL-based approach not only enhanced task success rates and efficiency, but also reduced the perceived workload by 7.1%, despite causing a 5.8% reduction in offline classification accuracy. This study highlights the potential of real-time contextualized adaptation to enhance user experience and usability of EMG-based systems for practical, goal-oriented applications, crucial elements towards their long-term adoption.

    "abstract": "As gallium nitride (GaN) devices prevail in power electronics, the operational safety and reliability attract more attention. Due to the small thermal mass and limited short-circuit (SC) withstand capability, the SC protection for GaN devices is crucial. One widely accepted scheme is desaturation (Desat) protection based on ON-state drain-source voltage ( v<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ds</inf> ) information, which, however, faces a design trade-off between response time and noise immunity, leaving its feasibility questionable for GaN applications. This paper proposes a novel SC detection scheme that leverages the pattern difference of the entire v<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ds</inf> between normal operation and fault scenarios, in terms of switching, ON- and OFF-states, breaking the compromise and achieving the targets of ultrafast detection with noise immunity. First, the characteristics of fault patterns are investigated, and detection strategy is accordingly discussed to distinguish the fault from normal operation. Then, the capacitor divider design is proposed for capturing the critical v<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ds</inf> patterns with noise immunity.

Finally, circuit simulation and hardware tests are performed for design validation. The ultrafast SC detection time are observed of around 30 − 40 ns, which is actually even smaller excluding the propagation delay of isolators in the measurement."

This study investigates the effect of cohort size on the creation of such anatomical references for movement disorders. Pre-operative MRI data from 70 patients implanted with DBS systems were used to generate anatomical templates with varying cohort sizes (5 to 67 subjects). An iterative non-linear normalization pipeline was employed to optimize template generation. Template variability was assessed using Dice overlap of anatomical structures. The templates created with 44 subjects achieved an optimal balance between variability and precision. Tukey’s HSD test confirmed significant differences between iterations and cohort sizes. This study underscores the importance of cohort size and iterative registration methods in creating high-quality anatomical templates.Clinical relevance— The findings provide insights into the optimal cohort size for creating group-specific anatomical brain templates."

This method activates deep brain structures through the application of high-frequency (>1 kHz) electrical potentials on the human scalp by using two pairs of electrodes. This study explores the feasibility of inducing oscillations in the gamma frequency band (30-100 Hz) using tTIS aiming to target deep brain structures within an in-house built realistic pediatric human head phantom model that mimics the electromagnetic properties of a human head. Dipolar potentials were measured using an oscilloscope connected to four dipoles located in pre-defined deep brain structures within the phantom. We used low-frequency amplitude-modulated envelopes to generate gamma oscillations (in low-and high-gamma frequencies: 40 and 70 Hz) between two stimulation channels. We observed that stimulation depicted low-and high-gamma oscillations in the right posterior orbital cortex successfully. Statistical analysis corroborated the finding of this study that oscillatory responses were higher in target compared to control (non-stimulating) structures (p<0.05). Our findings indicate that tTIS exhibits spatial specificity and effective induction of gamma oscillatory activity. Thus, tTIS has the potential to replace conventional invasive neurostimulation methods (e.g., deep brain stimulation) through effective and specified noninvasive neuromodulation.Clinical Relevance— Our findings support the future use of tTIS in order to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders by inducing noninvasive gamma-band-related neural activity."

In this study, we propose MyoBM-Net, a convolutional feature extraction method for identification applications using EMG signals. Instead of using the conventional frequency domain-based feature extraction, 1D convolution and 2D convolution layers are utilized to extract spatial and channel-specific information, respectively. The performance evaluation utilized wrist EMG data from 43 participants on three different days across one month while performing hand/wrist gestures. A cross-day analysis, with training and testing data collected on separate days, was conducted to assess the robustness of EMG-based biometrics in practical settings. In cross-day identification, MyoBM-Net achieved a median rank-1 accuracy of 98.5% and outperformed the conventional feature extraction method. The proposed method resulted in a lower DBI value of 1.73, highlighting its strong potential for use in personal identification applications.

However, growing parameter uncertainties in modern power systems, including time-varying output power of renewable energy and line impedance, can provoke severe low-frequency oscillation (LFO) stability issues for GFM converters when control strategies are not properly designed. To address this issue, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model incorporating source-grid parameters uncertainties is first established. Within this modeling framework, the structured singular value (SSV) is theoretically derived via linear matrix inequality (LMI) equations to quantitatively assess the stability margins. Furthermore, by introducing a full-element perturbation, the system's performance can be characterized using the SSV of the uncertainty system. Targeting the optimal performance, a GA-DK iteration method applicable for optimizing the parameters of synchronization loop is then proposed, which effectively enhances the robust stability of the GFM converter. Finally, the validity of above stability analysis and proposed optimization methodology are verified through extensive simulation results."

    "abstract": "3D face reconstruction is extensively applied across various fields, including virtual reality(VR), augmented reality(AR), computer animation, medical imaging, and face recognition. However, traditional 3D reconstruction methods are hindered by high computational resource consumption, complex processing, and challenges in capturing facial details accurately and efficiently. In recent years, deep learning techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of 3D face reconstruction. Nevertheless, challenges remain in real-time rendering and detailed feature recovery. This has been a key focus for current research achieving a balance between efficiency and high accuracy. The main issue in this dissertation relies in the study of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for the representation of facial detail and their potential in the optimization of computational efficiency, and the use in digital human models. Experimental results show that 3DGS can enhance the quality of 3D face reconstruction and effectively alleviate the accuracy and computational burden limitations in the traditional methods. This dissertation offers a novel approach and technical pathway for 3D face reconstruction, with significant application value and development potential."

    "abstract": "Source-interface DC/DC converters are critical in DC cascaded systems for interfacing energy sources and loads but may suffer instability due to output/load impedance mismatches caused by the negative incremental impedance of constant power load (CPL). The article introduces a novel method that utilizes the nonlinear properties of nonlinear inductors within the power stage of a converter to dynamically adjust its output impedance, thereby enhancing the stability range. The concept presented revolves around the establishing of a resistive power versus constant power plane, which serves as a graphical framework to explore and define the stable power range of a circuit in relation to circuit parameters. Significantly, analysis of the power plane reveals a pivotal finding: the stability range of the system is maximized when the resistance of the inductor matches the characteristic impedance of the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$LC$</tex> circuit formed by the converter's inductor and output capacitor. A virtual inductor resistance control is thus proposed to ensure compliance with this impedance requirement. Experimental validation was undertaken on a scaled-down converter system."

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel consistency model-assisted approach for the optimal configuration of IESs, which comprehensively incorporates uncertainty modeling. First, a scenario generation and reduction method that uses consistency models in combination with the k-means++ clustering algorithm is developed. Second, a framework for IESs that captures the interactions among multiple energy carriers and components is constructed. Third, a two-stage stochastic programming approach for determining the optimal configuration of energy technologies and capacities in IESs is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through comprehensive case studies. The results demonstrate that explicitly considering uncertainties leads to increased installed capacities and more reliable system configurations, highlighting the importance of uncertainty-aware planning in IESs."

Although Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are often used to study cognitive states, most studies still rely on data collected in controlled laboratory environments. This paper collects EEG data from employees during their daily work using a commercial single-channel EEG headband, making attention detection closer to real-world applications and increasing its feasibility and promotion value. We propose a new classification method based on a multi-head attention transformer to identify six different attention levels. We first perform a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on the EEG signal. Subsequently, we constructed a transformer architecture to effectively model long-range dependencies and subtle pattern changes in EEG data using self-attention and stacked encoder layers. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves 87.37% classification accuracy in the six-level attention classification task, outperforming traditional high-performance methods and demonstrating superior performance compared to existing similar approaches. This achievement not only verifies the potential of the transformer architecture in EEG attention level classification but also provides new possibilities for developing advanced tools in fields such as brain-computer interface (BCI) and cognitive monitoring."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), edge caching has emerged as a pivotal technology within new computing paradigms for reducing transmission latency and optimizing network load. In traditional Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems, severe signal fading and intercell interference often lead to degraded throughput and even transmission failures, significantly hampering the availability of MEC services for cell-edge users. User-Centric MEC (UC-MEC) is regarded as a promising solution to this issue. However, due to the limited storage capacity of edge servers, devising dynamic service caching strategies that accommodate real-time fluctuating user demands during task offloading remains a critical challenge. It is noteworthy that existing edge caching approaches in UCMEC networks largely overlook fairness among users. This paper presents the first attempt to address the edge caching problem in UC-MEC networks while incorporating fairness in service provision. Specifically, we formulate a dynamic edge caching framework and jointly optimize base station clustering and service caching decisions to maximize user fairness while minimizing service caching costs. To handle the hybrid action space inherent in this problem, we employ the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic (TD3) Policy Gradient algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves rapid convergence and exhibits superior performance in terms of both service latency and fairness."

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), a non-contact technology, has gained significant attention for vital signs monitoring.

This paper aims to present a more comprehensive modeling framework for transmitter-side low-frequency metamaterials in WPT systems operating in the kilohertz frequency range. Based on this framework, the characteristics of the equivalent circuit parameters are analyzed in relation to both the number of stacked passive coil array (SPCA) units and their resonant frequencies. Furthermore, comparisons are conducted between two transmitter-side compensation schemes, namely the series and LCC configurations, focusing on maximum efficiency, output power, and harmonic distortion. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate that implementing LCC compensation on the transmitter side significantly enhances efficiency and output power while effectively reducing harmonic distortion."

Infections, often caused by staphylococcal species, are extremely difficult to treat due to challenges in targeting the infection site whilst avoiding systemic toxicity. This study reports on the development of a novel implant coating to provide controlled, local drug-release, for the inhibition of infection. The release of the broad-spectrum antibiotic rifampicin from a range of biodegradable poly (lacticacid) (PLA) and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer formulations was analysed. Increasing the fraction of polymer in a formulation provided control over release; e.g. increasing the PLGA:rifampicin ratio from 25:75 to 75:25 significantly (p ≤ 0.001) slowed release of rifampicin from >99%, to <2% after 7 days. The antimicrobial activity of PLGA:rifampicin based formulations (25:75, 50:50, 75:25) against Staphylococcus aureus revealed that all formulations retained antimicrobial activity over 7 days in disk diffusion tests. The 50:50 formulation produced significantly (p ≤ 0.05) larger zones of growth inhibition than the 25:75 or 75:25 formulations. This investigation confirms rifampicin can be released from biocompatible, polymer-based coatings, and reveals potential for engineering both the release rate and level of antimicrobial efficacyClinical Relevance— This research demonstrates the potential of synthetic polymer coatings for the prevention of medical implant infections."

However, current research is limited to proposing reconfiguration strategies that improve the adaptability and resilience of the system without providing an interpretation of the reconfiguration mechanism and capacity constraints. This paper analyzes the operational mechanism and network structure of a multi-agent system based on the concept of typical operation loop while integrating reconfigurable features to propose a model called reconfigurable heterogeneous multi-agent network (RHMN). Additionally, this study examines network capability constraints under reconfiguration factors by introducing network evaluation indices and resilience measurements based on capability-load. Finally, using missile equipment systems as a case study example, we analyze the resilience of the proposed reconfigurable heterogeneous multi-agent network model using these models and indices to verify their validity and effectiveness."

    "abstract": "This article presents a real-time method for detecting bond wire lift-off in SiC MOSFETs by incorporating a switched-capacitor-based level shifter and a parallel-connected resonant tank into the gate drive circuit. This approach eliminates the need for external signal injections or additional equipment while enabling negative voltage turn-off. The idea is based on monitoring the energy distribution within a specific frequency band of the resonator upon turn-off of the SiC MOSFETs and a switched-capacitor-based circuit to generate a negative gate-source voltage to counteract the impact of spurious gate-source voltage. The effectiveness of this method has been validated in a 100W, 64V/32V, 100kHz buck converter."

    "abstract": "Early detection of burnout is of utmost importance to avoid severe health consequences. Burnout is typically assessed through standardized questionnaires with self-reported information, a technique that could potentially delay its diagnosis. Wearable devices continuously and unobtrusively collect health-related data, making them valuable tools for the early detection of several mental health issues, including burnout syndrome. In this paper we report initial insights on the machine learning prediction of baseline burnout risk across cognitive, emotional, and physical dimensions. Our data consists of the first 30 days of a 9-months longitudinal study with 239 participants, including monthly burnout assessments and health data from smartwatches. Aggregated mean and standard deviation of physiological features over time windows of varying duration were employed as predictors of baseline burnout risk. Models employing sleep, cardiac, and stress features achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.66 and 0.68 in the detection of cognitive weariness and physical fatigue risk, respectively. The prediction of emotional exhaustion risk reached lower performance with a balanced accuracy of 0.55, suggesting the need of integrating additional data sources to reach better-than-chance performance. We expect to improve burnout risk prediction by crafting additional features and exploiting the collected data over their full longitudinal scale."

    "abstract": "Surface-mounted permanent-magnet axial flux topologies are known to have comparatively high specific torque and power. Although surface permanent magnet (SPM) rotors are typical, Halbach arrays offer higher specific torque at the cost of manufacturing complexity. This work proposes a quasi-Halbach (QHB) solution which achieves comparable air gap flux density with a feasible mechanical construction and reduced magnet content. 2D finite-element-analaysis (FEA) design of experiments investigations compare the properties and relative performance of SPM, QHB array and full-pitch Halbach array rotor topologies for a fixed stator configuration. This application is demonstrated to achieve up to 11.2% higher specific torque with a Halbach array rotor than an SPM rotor under a high electrical loading, with the new solution achieving a 9.5% gain over SPM. Additionally, this was achieved with 18% less magnet material than HBA. Experimental tests benchmark a quasi-Halbach design against an existing SPM rotor to verify flux linkage and field shaping behaviours, demonstrating a 27.1% increase in back-EMF with only 2.7% greater magnetic material mass."

However, its efficiency can drop at light loads due to loss of soft switching. This paper uses a generalized model for the three-limb transformer and explores how unevenly splitting the secondary windings affects the phase shift angle. By adjusting the winding distribution, the soft- switching region of the 3p-DAB can be expanded. Using a complex variable stationary reference frame, the model captures winding currents precisely, offering deeper insight into system behavior. The study also focuses on how this partitioning improves soft switching, especially in extended delta transformer setups. Finally, a study of controllability is employed in order to design a voltage controller. The findings aim to support engineers and researchers in boosting the performance and efficiency of 3p-DAB converters."

Currently, the diagnostic procedure relies on time-consuming and labor-intensive inspection of polysomnography (PSG). This study proposes a Machine Learning (ML), stage-agnostic framework for the automatic detection of RBD subjects through unstaged, single-channel EEG sleep data from 58 subjects (32 RBD). The best model achieved 86.21% accuracy, 90.6% sensitivity, and 87.9% F-1 score, demonstrating strong predictive power. This study is the first to explore whole-night EEG data for RBD detection, paving the way for scalable, lightweight clinical decision support systems for early neurodegenerative screening and risk assessment.Clinical relevance— This study presents a lightweight, clinical decision support tool to enhance RBD detection and support early interventions in neurodegenerative diseases."

The innovative architecture, centred on a Wiser for KNX controller, overcomes the fundamental problem of the lack of communication with three single-phase Growatt inverters. This is achieved by collecting critical data through a network of external Modbus RS-485 sensors. The main contribution of this research is the development and validation of a dual-condition control logic, which intelligently manages high-power loads by simultaneously monitoring the generated photovoltaic power and the battery voltage. This strategy not only maximizes self-consumption by aligning the consumption curve with the production curve but also protects the storage system, preventing premature wear. The results, validated by the data recorded by the system, demonstrate the functionality and efficiency of the solution, achieving the objective of utilizing 100% of the produced solar energy."

    "abstract": "Recent work characterized shifts in preparatory activity of the motor cortex during motor learning. The specific shift geometry during learning, washout, and relearning blocks was hypothesized to implement the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of motor memories. We sought to train recurrent neural network (RNN) models that could be used to study these motor learning phenomena. We built an environment for a curl field (CF) motor learning task and trained RNNs with reinforcement learning (RL) with novel regularization terms to perform behaviorally realistic reaching trajectories over the course of learning. Our choice of RL over supervised learning was motivated by the idea that motor adaptation, in the absence of demonstrations, is a process of reoptimization. We find these models, despite lack of supervision, reproduce many behavioral findings from monkey CF adaptation experiments. These models also captured key neurophysiological findings. We found that the model’s preparatory activity existed in a force-predictive subspace that remained stable across learning, washout, and relearning. Additionally, preparatory activity shifted uniformly, independently of the distance to the CF trained target. Finally, we found that the washout shift became more orthogonal to the learning shift, and hence more brain-like, when the RNNs were pretrained to have prior experience with CF dynamics. We argue the increased fit to neurophysiological recordings is driven by more generalizable and structured dynamical motifs in the model with more prior experience. This suggests that prior experience could organize preparatory neural activity underlying motor memory to have more orthogonal characteristics, by forming structured dynamical motifs in the motor cortex circuitry."

    "abstract": "The P300 Speller is a brain-computer interface system that employs electroencephalography(EEG) signals for character input, which may offer a novel avenue for individuals with disabilities to communicate with the external world. However, the redundancy ofchannel information and the complexity of spatiotemporal features within EEG data present significant challenges to the spelling task. Moreover, the prevalent convolutional neural networks are only capable of extracting local temporal features, which limits their ability to capture longterm dependencies for EEG decoding. In response to these challenges, this paper attempts to apply Transformer to P300 speller and proposes a multiscale convolutional Transformer network incorporating the dual channel attention, named DCAFormer. DCA-Former combines the advantages of CNN for local feature extraction and Transformer for global dependency learning, while incorporating EEG channel attention and efficient channel attention mechanisms to address channel redundancy and enhance feature extraction. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that the DCA-Former effectively harnesses information accumulated from repetitive stimuli, significantly improving spelling accuracy. This research result provides innovative ideas and methods to enhance the performance of the P300 speller, thereby facilitating more efficient communication for individuals with disabilities."

We tested four standard clustering algorithms including K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering and DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Model through analysis of the initial dataset together with ten additional datasets built utilizing document representation using the first ten to the first one most frequent words. The use of K-Means clustering achieves maximum efficiency when documents are displayed through their top 10 frequent words thus leading to improved accuracy in document classification. The main goal was to prove the feasibility of the methodology rather than reaching maximum clustering accuracy yet our analysis proves that document complexity reduction boosts cluster quality especially when processing large-scale data.

In this case, dual-mode overmodulation control of PWM inverters is based on modified control correlations. Specifically, these correlations include two special overmodulation coefficients, defined as functions of two modulation threshold indices for PV inverters and two threshold frequencies for drive inverters. Simulations demonstrate the behavior of these inverter-based power conversion systems operating at increased modulation indices of PWM inverters."

The TWIN lower limb exoskeleton developed at the Rehab Technologies Lab of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) is an innovative prototype that has been previously tested on people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and post-stroke conditions. However, the absence of active ankle control limits its effectiveness, especially in addressing foot drop and foot slap. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the tibialis anterior (TA) has been shown to mitigate these deficits by promoting dorsiflexion during gait. This study evaluates the integration of TWIN with a FES system to improve ankle mobility. Ten healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with the TWIN+FES system for 30 minutes. Kinematic data showed that FES improved dorsiflexion during the swing phase, leading to more physiological ankle trajectories. Although some subjects exhibited signs of muscle fatigue, there were no significant changes in ankle performance over time. These findings support the feasibility of integrating FES with TWIN and lay the groundwork for future investigations into its impact on gait patterns and potential rehabilitation benefits. Future studies should investigate the effects of this approach in individuals with neurological impairments, and assess its impact on reducing exoskeleton motor demands.Clinical relevance—The combination of lower limb exoskeletons with functional electrical stimulation has the potential to enhance gait rehabilitation in individuals with SCI or post-stroke conditions.

Standard optical character recognition (OCR) tools fail to accurately interpret these molded component identifiers, due to the low visibility, molding-induced artifacts, and minimal contrast between the component’s text and its surfaces, limiting the automation potential and sustaining dependency on labor-intensive and error-prone manual processes. This paper introduces an innovative, zero-shot solution, SMaRT-STR, ensembling state-of-the-art scene text recognition (STR) and lexicon-based sequence matching techniques to overcome the challenging visual conditions. Scene text recognition models, originally developed for interpreting complex environmental text for autonomous vehicles, are uniquely suited for accurately deciphering non-uniform, low-contrast, and distorted text. An additional prediction refinement layer is integrated, implementing algorithms traditionally utilized in bioinformatics for DNA sequence alignment. This leverages the known sample batch information and uses it to reframe the recognition task to a classification problem. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of this hybrid approach, achieving above 99% decoding accuracy across diverse imaging conditions, including scenarios hardly distinguishable by human operators. These results highlight the capability of cross-domain methodology fusion, showcasing substantial potential to streamline quality control processes, significantly reduce manual effort, and increase operational reliability in manufacturing environments.

To fill this gap, we develop the first LLM-augmented synthetic data generation method to enhance causal fairness using real-world tabular health data. Our generated data deviates by less than 10% from real data on causal fairness metrics. When trained on causally fair predictors, synthetic data reduces bias on the sensitive attribute by 70% compared to real data. This work improves access to fair synthetic data, supporting equitable health research and healthcare delivery."

    "abstract": "In the semiconductor industry, there has been a continuous process technology scaling. This enables more logic into the limited space and more chips from a same sized wafer. All electrical power consumed by the chip is converted into heat, and the on-chip temperature depends on the thermal design of the chip itself. Heat causes more leakage currents inside the components of semiconductors. Although the required operational power remains constant, the resulting heat leads to additional consumption of temperature-dependent leakage power. An increase in leakage power generates further heat, leading to negative feedback whereby increased temperatures cause additional leakage power, potentially causing runaway heating without proper thermal control. Therefore, managing temperature is critical in semiconductor chips, especially in mobile semiconductors which have restricted cooling environments. While package structures aim to remove internal hot spots within the chip, optimal design optimization concerning thermal coupling-induced hotspots is essential from the chip-design perspective. This paper discusses studies conducted from a thermal engineering standpoint aimed at achieving optimized cooling designs for environments containing multiple functional blocks integrated onto one chip, similar to mobile System-On-Chip Application Processors (SOC AP)."

    "abstract": "Using plants in traditional medicine has been a practice for centuries and has contributed significantly to human well-being. Despite modern medicine's advancements, herbal medicine still holds promise and relevance. This study introduces an innovative mobile application called Herbal Finder, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, leveraging technology accessibility. The application uses deep learning-based models to classify herbal plants, providing users with essential information on their benefits and usage. Additionally, it integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) for symptom-based search queries and incorporates a speech-to-text search option using the Whisper Model API by OpenAI. Previous studies have explored various algorithms for herbal plant recognition, suggesting that such systems should be implemented on smartphones for public access. This study proposes an ensemble model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers to enhance the accuracy and reliability of herbal plant classification. The most effective CNN classifiers were identified and integrated into the application through diligent testing. The results of the study showed that after testing seven different models; VGG, ResNet, SqueezeNet, and Inception models were used in the ensemble model with the highest accuracy being 99.99% and the fine-tuned ClinicalBERT model obtained an accuracy 98.53%. The Herbal Finder mobile application was able to provide the users with the necessary information for their query, either through means of Images, Voice or Text."

    "abstract": "Here we document cortical neural connectivity changes associated with several weeks of prosthetic use in an individual with bilateral upper-limb congenital amputation. Secondly, we explore how those changes relate to prosthetic performance over time. Previous research in unilateral aplasia has shown that functional brain connectivity and activations can be disrupted in the missing hand area, and that prosthetic use can normalize those abnormalities. Functional connectivity and prosthetic use related brain changes in individuals with bilateral congenital upper limb amputations have not been defined. Here, we describe functional and structural connectivity changes measured with MRI after 10-weeks’ unilateral use of an sEMG-controlled virtual prosthetic in an individual with aplasia born without either arm. We find that both functional connectivity and structural connectivity change with sEMG prosthetic use. Specifically, functional connectivity of motor regions tends to lateralize and become more hemisphere specific. Additionally, structural connectivity of motor cortico-spinal white matter projections and interhemispheric commissural projections increase after sEMG prosthetic use. These functional connectivity changes are different from those previously reported for one-handed congenital amputees, where prosthetic use normalized, not lateralized, imbalanced interhemispheric motor connectivity. Alongside these neural changes, sEMG virtual prosthetic performance both increased and decreased over time, depending on the action performed. Our results suggest that neural representations of bilateral congenital amputation and subsequent neural adaptions with unilateral prosthetic use may be distinct from those of unilateral congenital and traumatic upper-limb amputees. Consideration of condition-specific neurobiology may be critical in developing effective neuro-prostheses.Clinical Relevance— This describes the neural changes induced by sEMG prosthetic control in a congenital bilateral amputee."

    "abstract": "Utilizing battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) to smooth the fluctuating power from direct-drive wave energy converters (DDWECs) is a common practice in the DDWEC community. However, existing model predictive control (MPC)-based energy-capture-optimizing strategies for DDWECs are ineffective at accounting for the degradation of HESS, primarily the battery. To address this limitation, this article proposes a battery-friendly MPC strategy. Specifically, the battery ampere-hour (Ah) throughput, obtained using a low-pass filtering rule, is incorporated into the MPC objective function to enable awareness of battery degradation. The MPC simultaneously pursues two control objectives: increasing net electricity generation and reducing battery Ah throughput. The priorities of these two objectives are dynamically adjusted according to the grid-connected power demand. Finally, simulations and experiments conducted under various operating conditions verify the proposed strategy's ability to enhance net electricity generation and extend battery lifespan."

Performance metrics for this trade study of control laws look at minimizing: i) magnetic core flux saturation, ii) voltage and control effort ringing/oscillations, iii) required energy storage, and iv) transient decay. Additionally, minimizing control effort does not necessarily imply minimized energy storage. Highlights for the results of two of the potential control designs contrast a modern linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback controller with a novel Hamiltonian feedback control. The novel controller produced minimal amount of energy storage required to mitigate the HEMP insult."

    "abstract": "Characterizing functional brain networks (FBNs) has always been an important issue in the field of neuroimaging and brain mapping. Traditional methods often suffer from limitations such as low signal-to-noise ratio and restricted spatial resolution when processing fMRI data. In contrast, deep learning has been demonstrated to exhibit superior performance over traditional methods and can be effectively applied to fMRI data. However, due to the high dimensionality of fMRI volumetric data and the lack of labeled data, deep learning is prone to overfitting in supervised training processes. Most deep learning-based models for functional brain networks identification neglect the critical spatial information of fMRI volumes. In order to tackle these problems, our study proposed and utilized a 3D variational autoencoder (3DVAE) to identify the spatio-temporal features from task-based fMRI (tfMRI) data. As a generative model, 3DVAE can learn fMRI volumetric data in an unsupervised manner without the requirement of any labels, hence resolving the issue of data scarcity. Using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Q1 data as test-bed, 3DVAE can effectively learn more meaningful and interpretable FBNs than state-of-art method. Furthermore, as a complete data-driven model, 3DVAE can capture meaningful temporal features embedded in tfMRI signals at both subject-level and group-level. We also evaluated the performance of 3DVAE on small datasets and found that it can still derive meaningful spatio-temporal features of tfMRI data even with limited samples."

    "abstract": "The transformer’s attention mechanism has revolutionized AI and machine learning, with its efficient computation being crucial to its performance. However, calculating attention involves matrix operations interspersed with softmax rescaling, which inherently slows down computation and requires processing the entire input sequence. Building on online softmax computation, FlashAttention integrates softmax calculation with matrix arithmetic, enabling tiled computation independent of sequence length. While optimized for GPUs, FlashAttention’s simplicity makes it amenable to direct hardware acceleration. This work re-evaluates the core FlashAttention kernel, presenting FLASH-D a mathematically equivalent, yet simplified, formulation that achieves: (a) hiding softmax division within other nonlinear function evaluations; (b) inherently numerically stable computation of exponentials, eliminating the need for maximum value subtraction; and (c) a reduction in computational cost without introducing numerical approximations to the FlashAttention kernel. Importantly, the essential FlashAttention properties that facilitate efficient tiled implementation are fully preserved. Hardware implementation results at 28nm demonstrate that this proposed formulation achieves a 22.8% reduction in area and a 20.3% reduction in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art parallel hardware architectures without any performance penalty."

    "abstract": "The temperature rise of stator windings has a significant influence on the torque density, lifetime, and efficiency of electric machinery. The prediction of the thermal performance of electric machines is critical to ensuring the desired lifetime of winding insulation, losses, and demagnetization risk. A popular thermal modeling technique for electric machines is lumped parameter thermal networks (LPTNs). One of the challenges of using LPTNs for estimating electric machine temperatures is that thermal conductivities and thermal capacitances are significantly influenced by manufacturing and material variations. This paper presents the use of AutoRegressive eXongenous (ARX) system identification techniques for the estimation of secondorder Ohmic power loss to winding temperature transfer function coefficients or time constants. Five motorettes are constructed to explore the influence of the input signal, sample rate, and data record length on ARX coefficient estimation. The winding temperatures predicted by the second-order transfer function with ARX estimated coefficients matches very closely with experimentally measured winding temperatures during validation. Differences in the thermal coefficents and time constants among the motorettes due to intentional construction variation were detected using the ARX technique."

Extracting this information from casually collected biosignal data in activities of daily living holds great potential for real-time monitoring of physical and mental states, but comes with increased difficulty due to the influence of noise and artifacts. Thus, we create CogniFuse, the first publicly available multi-task benchmark for multimodal biosignal fusion in such challenging environments. For many biosignals, especially electrophysiological signals, the information contained in different frequency bands plays a significant role in analyzing the physiological states of the body. Therefore, we introduce a group of novel fusion models, called Multimodal Deformers, that capture multi-level power features as well as long- and short-term temporal dependencies in multimodal biosignal data. In particular, our proposed Multi-Channel Deformer achieves the highest average benchmark score, outperforming all models of comparison. To assure full transparency and reproducibility, and to support future research on multimodal biosignal fusion, all code and data is made publicly available.Clinical relevance— Human biosignals provide important insight into various medical conditions.

    "abstract": "The quantification of muscle blood flow is crucial in fields such as exercise physiology and rehabilitation medicine. While diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is a well-established, noninvasive method for measuring tissue blood flow, its widespread use is hindered by the need for expensive photon counters and its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS), a novel technique utilizing a megapixel camera (e.g., a complementary metal– oxide–semiconductor camera), has emerged as a promising alternative. This method utilizes spatial speckle contrast to measure blood flow, offering a higher SNR at a reduced cost. This study evaluates the feasibility of SCOS in quantifying muscle blood flow under active conditions and compares its performance directly with that of DCS. The results indicate that SCOS is consistent with DCS in terms of relative blood flow index measurements, and its SNR surpasses that of DCS, particularly in detecting pulsatile blood flow. These findings position SCOS as a cost-effective, high-precision tool for monitoring skeletal muscle microcirculation during physical activities, potentially enhancing clinical and research applications in vascular function assessment.Clinical Relevance— SCOS presents a cost-effective alternative to DCS for the assessment of blood flow in active muscles, offering a superior SNR and enhanced detection of pulsatile flow.

However, they may require substantial pre-processing and feature engineering to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, deep learning models like CNN, HAN, CNN-LSTM, HLSTM, and BERT offer a viable alternative with remarkable classification accuracy. This study explored deep learning models, particularly the Hierarchical LSTM Model, HAN, and BERT for the AACCUP accreditation document classification. Based on the results of the experiments, using the basic metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score), the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) stands out as the best-performing classifier among the evaluated models. It achieves an impressive accuracy of 99%, the same as BERT but with slightly lower precision, recall, and F1-score.

    "abstract": "A four-leg inverter can be used to power three-phase loads without switching frequency common mode volt-age (CMV). This paper presents a review and a quantitative comparison of four CMV elimination methods, to help the inverter designer select the most effective solution for a given application. Three different pulse width modulation strategies and a pulse density modulation method are reviewed, analyzed and compared in simulations and experimentally in terms of output voltage total harmonic distortion, switching losses and conducted electromagnetic interference. Simulation results and experimental measurements on a laboratory VSI built with SiC MOSFETs are presented for a quantitative comparison. Additional experimental measurements highlight the advantage of using a four-leg VSI versus a three-leg structure."

    "abstract": "There is a great demand for mental fatigue recognition for enhancing work efficiency and the immersion of contents. Brain activity and eye movements are valuable biomarkers for mental fatigue recognition, as they reflect attentional processes associated with this state. However, a key challenge lies in the lack of mental fatigue recognition models grounded in physiological mechanisms. Blink-related brain activity has been investigated as a potential physiological mechanism, and further exploration is needed from the perspective of its applications to recognition models and minimizing form factors. In this paper, we propose a physiologically interpretable deep neural network (DNN) that extracts and averages blink-related electroencephalography (EEG) features extracted solely from an EEG device for accurate mental fatigue recognition. In this study, the contribution of our proposed architecture was validated using data collected by an EEG device with electrodes across the entire scalp. The results showed that our proposed framework improved the performance of mental fatigue recognition (an average accuracy of 0.73 and a macro-F1 score of 0.72). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that our proposed framework makes use of psychophysiological mechanisms. These findings indicate the potential of our framework for effectively capturing blink-related brain activity reflecting mental fatigue by extracting EEG signals associated with blinks and averaging the extracted features."

    "abstract": "Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are powerful, massively parallel processors that have become ubiquitous in modern computing. In recent years, the GPU market has diversified, with vendors like AMD and Intel offering high-performance alternatives to NVIDIA. However, most applications are written using NVIDIA’s CUDA API, which is incompatible with non-NVIDIA GPUs, creating significant challenges for developers who must port their code to different architectures. To address this issue, AMD developed the Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP), an open-source API for cross-vendor GPU programming. However, HIP is relatively new, leaving gaps in the literature regarding its performance, portability, and productivity. In this paper, we evaluate HIP using the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB), a CFD-based suite maintained by NASA. We present the first HIP-based implementation of NPB and conduct experiments on integrated and discrete GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel. Our results provide novel insights into HIP’s performance and portability, particularly for integrated GPUs and Intel discrete GPUs, which have been underrepresented in prior studies. We also assess productivity using different metrics to quantify the programming effort of HIP-based implementations. This work addresses key gaps in the literature, offering valuable data and insights for developers targeting emerging GPU architectures."

Traditional voltage control strategies rely on rule-based heuristics or optimization techniques, which often require detailed system models and extensive computational resources. The NARX-based controller learns system dynamics from historical data and predicts optimal reactive power dispatch in real-time for voltage correction. The proposed approach is evaluated on a power system feeder model under varying load and network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the NARX-based controller achieves improved voltage regulation, offering higher adaptability to system fluctuations. This study highlights the potential of data-driven control for enhancing the reliability of power distribution networks."

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D human pose estimation and ball tracking are fundamental to sports analytics, yet current state-of-the-art solutions often rely on expensive, proprietary systems with dense camera arrays, specialized hardware, and significant manual intervention. Moreover, these systems are rarely publicly available, making them difficult to reproduce or adapt in academic and low-resource settings. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, fully reproducible multiview system for 3D pose estimation of both players and the ball in basketball scenarios. Our setup employs off-the-shelf, static cameras distributed around a full-size court, supported by a robust calibration pipeline to enable triangulation-based 3D reconstruction. We leverage a custom YOLOv11 implementation for both ball detection and 2D human pose estimation across views, and 3D reconstruction through geometric methods without fine-tuning the model for the human pose task. To evaluate accuracy, we compare results against ground-truth optical motion capture data recorded in the same environment. Our experiments reveal the limitations of current pose models in distant-camera, real-game-like settings, underscoring the need for publicly available benchmarks in sports vision. To facilitate reproducible research, we provide a small annotated dataset of single-player basketball actions with a ball. Rather than focusing on full automation or commercial-level output, our goal is to highlight the gap between existing models and real-world sports conditions, and to offer a practical, open baseline for future method development and dataset expansion in unconstrained environments."

    "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While this condition can be managed by administering controller medications through handheld inhalers, clinical studies have shown low adherence to the correct inhaler usage technique. Consequently, many patients may not receive the full benefit of their medication. Automated classification of inhaler sounds has recently been studied to assess medication adherence. However, the existing classification models were typically trained using data from specific inhaler types, and their ability to generalize to sounds from different inhalers remains unexplored. In this study, we adapted the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised learning model for inhaler sound classification by pre-training and fine-tuning this model on inhaler sounds. The proposed model shows a balanced accuracy of 98% on a dataset collected using a dry powder inhaler and a smartwatch device. The results also demonstrate that re-finetuning this model on minimal data from a target inhaler is a promising approach to adapting a generic inhaler sound classification model to a different inhaler device and audio capture hardware. This is the first study in the field to demonstrate the potential of smartwatches as assistive technologies for the personalized monitoring of inhaler adherence using machine learning models.Clinical relevance—Accurate classification of inhaler sounds, which can be captured using consumer devices, is an essential step toward developing personalized systems for assessing inhaler compliance, which can improve patient outcomes by ensuring proper medication delivery and effectiveness. Individual monitoring of inhaler adherence could also play a key role in evaluating medication efficacy in future personalized medicine clinical trials."

However, this reliance has also raised significant concerns about data privacy, security breaches, and unauthorized access. Block chain technology offers a decentralized and immutable framework that can address these challenges, ensuring enhanced data privacy and security in healthcare. This paper explores the integration of block chain into healthcare systems to safeguard sensitive patient information while maintaining accessibility for authorized stakeholders. It discusses the key features of block chain, including cryptographic encryption, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts, and their applicability in ensuring data integrity, secure sharing, and compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. Furthermore, the paper evaluates block chain-based healthcare use cases, such as electronic health records (EHRs), secure data exchange, and patient consent management, supported by real-world implementations and research. Challenges, including scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance, are also analyzed, alongside proposed solutions. By leveraging block chain, healthcare systems can achieve a paradigm shift toward a more secure, transparent, and patient-centric approach to data privacy."

A doubly-fed induction machine is utilized as the primary electromechanical component, providing stable performance across a broad range of wave energy conditions. To improve system responsiveness and reduce dependence on external measurement devices, an internal model-based observer is implemented for real-time estimation of rotor speed, complemented by a grid voltage estimation method that facilitates reliable synchronization and control. The complete system is developed and analyzed within both the MATLAB/Simulink and PLECS simulation environments. Simulation studies under varying grid and wave conditions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in delivering robust, efficient energy conversion and precise control. The control strategy exhibits strong adaptability to grid fluctuations and supports accurate power regulation. The system is comprehensively verified through simulation, and a series of representative case studies are presented to demonstrate and validate its performance."

However, existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing overall image reconstruction quality, which may not fully align with user experiences, often driven by the quality of regions of interest (ROI). Motivated by this, we propose ROI-guided joint source-channel coding (ROI-JSCC), a novel deepJSCC framework that prioritizes high-quality transmission of ROI. The ROI-JSCC consists of four key components: (1) Image ROI embedding, (2) ROI-guided split processing, (3) ROI-based loss function design, and (4) ROI-adaptive bandwidth allocation. Together, these components enable ROI-JSCC to selectively enhance the ROI reconstruction quality at varying ROI positions while maintaining overall image quality with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results under diverse communication environments demonstrate that ROI-JSCC significantly improves ROI reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive average image quality compared to recent state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Pneumatic components are essential for precise control and automation in mechanical manufacturing. Leakage faults in pneumatic components can seriously undermine the reliability of manufacturing processes. When high-pressure gas leaks and expands, heat transfer between the gas and the component wall creates a localized low-temperature area. This thermal anomaly can be detected using thermal imaging techniques. However, thermal images captured from different pneumatic components exhibit distinct distribution patterns, which can significantly degrade the accuracy of existing detection methods. Conventional domain adaptation methods typically use the sample mean to represent feature distributions, neglecting intraclass dispersion and the interdependence among feature learning, classifier learning, and pseudolabel learning. To address these limitations, we propose a joint unsupervised domain adaptation method via cluster centers and thermal imaging for leakage detection in different pneumatic components (JCC-LDC). Specifically, JCC-LDC accounts for the fact that samples of a single class may disperse into multiple clusters, and it integrates feature learning, classifier learning, and pseudolabel learning into a unified framework based on cluster centers. Experimental results demonstrate that JCC-LDC increases the average detection accuracy from 71.5% to 82.3%, effectively enhancing the generalization capability of thermal-imaging-based leakage detection in pneumatic components."

Unfortunately, the communication components of satellites are susceptible to radiation-induced single event upsets (SEUs), which lead to the failure of ISLs and the decline in network throughput. In this paper, we study the impact of SEUs on network throughput and propose MSC design algorithms to enhance the throughput. To mitigate the impact of SEUs, each satellite is equipped with low-cost mitigation techniques, under which ISLs experience different levels of impairment. Furthermore, we derive the expressions of network throughput and observe the mismatch between the traffic pattern and the network topology. Based on the expressions, we develop the MSC design algorithm to address the gap for throughput enhancement. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the network throughput by 8.42% compared to the classical topology under the impact of SEUs."

    "abstract": "The Android platform provides a series of animation APIs, with which app developers can improve the implementation efficiency of UI animations—specifically, reducing the effort and time required to implement them. To assist app developers in quickly finding the suitable animation APIs, we have proposed two recommendation models called Animation2API and U-A2A. Animation2API has the capability to generate a list of available animation APIs for the UI animation task using the collaborative filtering algorithm. In contrast, U-A2A can encode both the animation API context and the UI animation task, and then predict the next animation API for the current animation implementation based on the joint encoding of the two modalities. Since U-A2A can provide real-time recommendations throughout the process of animation implementation, it is effective in assisting developers in using animation API resources. Nevertheless, U-A2A has three key limitations. First, its GRU encoder for the animation API context has difficulty in adequately capturing the long-distance dependencies and the global information. Second, its 3D CNN encoder for the UI animation task fails to effectively extract the long-distance dependencies between video frames and the spatiotemporal features at different scales. Third, U-A2A consistently treats the two modalities equally when fusing their encodings, despite the need to adaptively adjust their contribution levels according to the actual situation. To address these limitations, the paper introduces a novel animation API recommendation model named AC2Next. AC2Next adopts an encoder component based on the self-attention mechanism to encode the animation API context and the UI animation task. Specifically, it uses GRU with the self-attention mechanism as the encoder of the animation API context and applies ViViT, a Transformer architecture with self-attention mechanisms, to encode the UI animation task. Meanwhile, AC2Next utilizes its adaptive weight layer to assign appropriate weights to the animation API context and the UI animation task during the information fusion process. The experimental results show that AC2Next can outperform U-A2A in any stage of the animation implementation. When considering 1, 3, 5, and 10 animation APIs, AC2Next achieves an improvement of 31.56%, 10.01%, 5.57%, and 3.34% respectively in recommendation accuracy compared to U-A2A."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a critical procedure in remote sensing image analysis that backs up various applications. High resolution remote sensing images contain a wealth of ground object features, which are organized into various describable scenes. The visual content offset towards each scene is an intuitive sense for understanding geospatial objects. However, existing semantic segmentation methods for remote sensing images generally neglect this intuition and lack the ability to adjust their perception preference on different images. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm for collecting scene information and dynamically adjusting the model inference process to be scene-aware. Specifically, our method leverages the class feature from the image to enhance the fixed class representation from the model. The interaction of these information is facilitated by a neighbor-friendly embedding space, making it more faithful to associate the image features and model parameters. For the model to better understand the complex scenes, a manifold mixup method is proposed to expand the effective embedding space on intra-class and inter-class regions, forcing the model to challenge the ambiguous instances in remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrated that our proposed improved the accuracy of semantic segmentation models on remote sensing images, overcoming the state-of-the-art methods."

A hybrid methodological approach, integrating the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy AHP) and a combined compromise solution (CoCoSo), was used to assess expert judgments. The findings indicate that practitioners consider Top managers' support as the most critical factor, followed by an emphasis on institutional innovation. Regarding CTI capabilities, organizations prioritize employees' abilities to resolving cyber threats, followed by their ability to analyze information security intelligence. This study extends the research scope of RBV and CTI capabilities and provides practical decision-making views.

For example, online sensor tracking data of an object may be less reliable but much cheaper than offline field inspection data.

Offline data is costly to acquire, but it is accurate and can yield a reward in correcting errors in online data. A nonlinear contextual bandit method is then proposed to estimate the expected reward of offline sampling decisions, and an offline sampling policy is obtained by maximizing the expected reward. Theoretical analysis indicates that DFO<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> achieves a sub-linear regret bound, which means that the reward of DFO<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> asymptotically approaches that of the optimal policy over time.

    "abstract": "Although a growing number of exoskeletons have been developed for occupational applications, wrist exoskeletons remain relatively rare. However, in the meat processing industry, elbow and hand-wrist musculoskeletal disorders are particularly common. The aim of this article was to assess the potential effectiveness and risks of a 670 g wrist exoskeleton prototype designed to assist operators during meat-cutting tasks. Six professional butchers performed three standardized tasks reproducing meat-cutting gestures in foam, in three randomized experimental conditions: 1) without exoskeleton, 2) wearing the exoskeleton passive, with brakes off, and 3) using it with brakes activated, locked in a static position. Cutting forces were recorded using an instrumented table, joint angles using an optoelectronic motion capture system, muscle activity using surface electromyographic (EMG), and user experience was assessed using questionnaires. The cutting inaccuracy was defined as the area between the prescribed task and the actual cut on the foam surface. Joint torques were estimated by inverse dynamics with and without taking the exoskeleton’s mass into account, to isolate its effect. Linear mixed-effects statistical models were fitted. With the exoskeleton active during tasks, EMG activity was decreased of up to 18.7% (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.01 to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.001) in the wrist flexors and increased of up to 61.7% (not significant to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.05) in the upper trapezius.

The proposed multicriteria exoskeleton evaluation has provided guidance for following prototyping stages. Too heavy wrist exoskeletons could increase the risk of shoulder tendinitis for such tasks."

    "abstract": "Enhancing video quality assessment (VQA) through semantic information integration is a critical research focus. Recent research has employed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as a foundation to improve semantic perception. However, the image-text alignment inherent in these pre-trained Vision-Language (VL) models frequently results in suboptimal VQA performance. While prompt engineering has recently targeted the language component to address this alignment issue, the unique insights resided in visual analysis is still overlooked for further advancing VQA tasks. Additionally, seeking a trade-off between quality separability and domain invariance in VQA remains largely unresolved within the VL paradigm. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-modal prompt-based approach to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we propose learnable prompts within the vision branch to foster synergy between visual and language modalities through a language-to-vision coupling function. The multi-view backbone is then carefully crafted with content enhancement and distortion-aware temporal modulation to ensure quality separability. The language prompts, derived from visual representations, are further supported by adaptive weighting mechanisms to optimize the balance between quality separability and domain invariance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over leading VQA models, showing significant improvements in generalization across diverse datasets.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a key role in promoting various multimedia and AI applications. However, with the explosive growth of multi-modal information, traditional knowledge graph completion (KGC) models cannot be directly applied. This has attracted a large number of researchers to study multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC). Since MMKG extends KG to the visual and textual domains, MMKGC faces two main challenges: (1) how to deal with the fine-grained modality information interaction and awareness; (2) how to ensure the dominant role of graph structure in multi-modal knowledge fusion and deal with the noise generated by other modalities during modality fusion. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel MMKGC model named TSAM, which integrates fine-grained modality interaction and dominant graph structure to form a high-performance MMKGC framework. Specifically, to solve the challenges, TSAM proposes the Fine-grained Modality Awareness Fusion method (FgMAF), which uses pre-trained language models better to capture fine-grained semantic information interaction of different modalities and employs an attention mechanism to achieve fine-grained modality awareness and fusion. Additionally, TSAM presents the Structure-aware Contrastive Learning method (SaCL), which utilizes two contrastive learning approaches to align other modalities more closely with the structured modality. Extensive experiments show the proposed TSAM model significantly outperforms existing MMKGC models on widely used multi-modal datasets.

The service district is partitioned into multiple jurisdictions, each with a charging station and multiple battery-swapping vans (BSVs) and batteries. BSVs carry multiple charged batteries and provide on-demand swapping service for electric vehicles. Once a BSV exhausts charged batteries, it returns to backend charging stations to reload charged batteries for subsequent services. Our modeling framework optimizes the fleet size/capacity/allocation of BSVs and the allocation of batteries and charging racks at stations. To this end, we develop a frontend BSV service model and a backend charging model to present the MBSS performance metrics, and introduce three customized algorithms to solve the MBSS configuration and its performance metrics. The framework is validated by a case study of Xiongan China, showing a promising application of the MBSS in practice."

    "abstract": "Due to the structural constraints of the salient-pole rotor and narrow air gap in reluctance machines, conventional winding direct cooling methods cannot be directly applied, limiting a further improvement in power density. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel direct oil cooling solution employing an in-slot sleeve (ISS) structure. The in-slot portion is enclosed by the ISS, while the motor ends are sealed with the end sleeve. These two components are combined through the stator end plate to form a complete enclosed cooling channel. This arrangement separates the windings from both stator and rotor components without occupying the air gap space, enabling direct winding cooling. This paper employs a 45kW ISS direct oil-cooled doubly salient electromagnetic machine (DSEM) as the test case. A refined thermal network model is developed, accounting for loss distribution characteristics of the motor, and the influence of the ISS on winding cooling performance is analyzed. An experimental platform validates prolonged operation at 3L/min flow rate, 65°C oil temperature, and 22.1A/mm² current density, confirming the accuracy of the thermal model. Furthermore, thermal simulation results demonstrate that the maximum sustainable current density reaches 27.1A/mm² at this flow rate."

    "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) management is a critical component of blood transfusion, but no mature technology capable of predicting BP response to blood transfusion exists. This paper concerns the development and preliminary in vivo testing of a BP prediction method applicable to hemorrhage and blood transfusion. Key obstacles are (i) large inter-individual variability in the BP response to blood transfusion, (ii) unknown hemorrhage, and (iii) input/state-dependent observability. To cope with these challenges, we developed a multi-modal sequential inference-enabled BP prediction method built upon a mathematical model of patient physiology parameterized by population-informed prior. The method infers patient-specific physiological state and hemorrhage, and uses them to predict future BP in a patient receiving blood transfusion. The in vivo testing of the method using the data collected from large animals undergoing hemorrhage and blood transfusion showed that it could adequately predict mean arterial BP with median absolute errors for 5-min and 15-min predictions of 3.1 mmHg and 7.4 mmHg as well as adequately infer physiological state and hemorrhage: all the hemorrhage events were detected with <3.5 min delay, with median F1 score of 85%. In sum, the prediction of BP response to blood transfusion may be feasible, even in the presence of unknown hemorrhage."

    "abstract": "This technical note investigates the stabilization of a continuous-time linear system, whose feedback loop is closed over a digital communication network with bit rate constraints and network delay. To reduce the required bit rate for the stabilization of the concerned system, we propose a novel quantization strategy which can utilize both the quantization bits and the time information to encode the system state. The time information is carried by event-triggering time instants and transmission time instants and can provide extra state information to the controller without consuming any bit rate. The proposed strategy schedules multiple data transmissions in a time-triggered manner after a triggered event. By appropriately co-designing transmission time instants and the corresponding quantization scheme, our time information can produce more state information than existing approaches. We derive a sufficient bit rate condition to guarantee the input-to-state stability of the concerned system, which depends on the unstable eigenvalues of the system matrix and the upper bound of network delay. The derived stabilizing bit rate can be lower than the current minimum stabilizing bit rates due to our enhanced time information. Numerical examples are provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Only the EarthCARE cloud profiling radar has Doppler capability; others measured only reflectivity due to challenges resulting from platform motion. One concept for achieving high-accuracy Doppler measurements uses the Displaced Phase Center Antenna (DPCA) method, in which two antennas are appropriately spaced so that platform motion is cancelled for pulse pairs. Our previous work initially looked at ideal DPCA performance and, most recently, effects of antenna pointing and position errors for the DPCA case where transmission alternates between the two antennas. This work completes the investigation of plausible antenna configurations’ error sources for the Doppler velocity estimation by considering the effects of antenna beamwidth differences, phase differences, and tilting of the DPCA baseline in the vertical plane. In addition to these new error sources, evaluation of all error sources for transmission on a single antenna are provided."

Recent evidence suggests normal adjacent tissue (NAT) represents an intermediate state between healthy and malignant tissues, highlighting its potential for early cancer detection. Discriminating fungal compositional profiles between tumor and NAT is thus critical for elucidating fungal involvement in oncogenesis.

Building upon previous work, where a multi-objective optimization framework identified the two-channel interleaved buck converter as the most effective topology in terms of efficiency and weight, the proposed design integrates an asymmetric phase-leg configuration composed of three high-side and one low-side SiC MOSFETs to accommodate the RSOFC's bidirectional yet asymmetric current demands. The PCB layout is carefully engineered to minimize and balance parasitic elements, achieving a commutation loop inductance of only 4.3 nH. A static thermal model incorporating copper inlays is implemented to improve the thermal performance of the surface-mount SiC MOSFETs. Furthermore, the design of the gate drive circuitry and the digital control platform responsible for implementing average current mode control is detailed. Experimental validation confirms the high-performance operation of the DC-DC converter, achieving peak efficiencies in excess of 99.1% and a gravimetric power density of 11 kW/kg."

The method’s effectiveness is demonstrated on discrete-time noisy synthetic data, where it outperforms existing techniques. Applying the method to real Heart Rate Variability (HRV) series (10 subjects from each cohort: healthy, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation) resulted in reduced physiological noise and decreased Sample Entropy (SampEn) across all groups. While a standard HRV analysis associated the highest SampEn with atrial fibrillation, denoising revealed that healthy individuals actually exhibit the highest cardiac complexity.

The aim of this study is to develop an ECT system that balances mechanical constraints and imaging performance for such integration. The system consists of three groups of electrodes with four electrodes in each group, which are mounted on a three-finger robotic grippers. Inspired by fan-beam scanning, the configuration includes one fixed electrode group and two variable electrode groups with inter-group angles of $0^{\\circ}, 20^{\\circ}, 40^{\\circ}$, and 60° for performance evaluation. For each configuration, rotational scanning is performed over 360° at $\\mathbf{1 0}^{\\circ}$ intervals for capacitance measurement. For image reconstruction, Landweber iteration masked by linear back projection (LBP) and multi-angle data fusion are employed. The imaging quality is assessed by image correlation coefficient (CC) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Simulation results show that for a twoobject target, the optimized reconstruction at 0° achieves the highest imaging performance, with SSIM of 0.98 and CC of 0.97. For annular and stratified targets, the angle-fused reconstruction provides superior structural fidelity across all angles. Overall, smaller inter-group angles consistently yield high reconstruction quality, particularly for complex targets. These findings establish practical guidelines for grouped electrode design in robotic ECT systems, enabling high-fidelity permittivity imaging across diverse object types, handled by a gripper."

    "abstract": "As the adoption of DC microgrids expands, the need for robust, fast, and cost-effective protection against faults becomes significant. Traditional protection methods often rely on DC circuit breakers (DCCBs), which can be slow or prohibitively expensive. This paper proposes a novel breakerless solid-state protection scheme for Voltage Source Converter (VSC)-based DC microgrids. The scheme utilizes the distributed protection devices (DPDs) integrated with solid-state switching devices (SSSDs), galvanic isolation switching devices (GISDs), and a protection controller at the terminal of each converter. The SSSD provides ultra-fast isolation of the converter bridge from the filter capacitor, while the GISD ensures physical isolation for safety. A central controller coordinates the functions of faulty branch location, faulty branch isolation, and restoration of the healthy parts of the system. The proposed protection scheme is capable of ultra-fast converter isolation from faults without interrupting high fault currents, and thus eliminates the need for DCCBs. The proposed scheme reduces protection cost and enhances feasibility of DC in field applications. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink, which demonstrate its ability to detect and isolate a fault, protect converter components, and restore the healthy parts of a microgrid to stable operation with minimal disruption."

    "abstract": "In human postural control, visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular functions cooperatively work to maintain a stable posture, known as sensory reweighting. Considering that the training effect on sensory reweighting is suggested to vary depending on the original sensory weights, examining the variations in weights across individuals is crucial. This study investigated the individual characteristics of sensory contributions more comprehensively and quantitatively by clustering analysis. A total of 122 participants performed the modified Sensory Organization Test (mSOT), which consists of the four standing conditions, and the three relative sensory weights were calculated using the center of pressure (COP) sway in each condition. Each participant’s sensory weights were classified with similar sensory properties using the X-means clustering method, showing that sensory characteristics could be divided into six clusters, suggesting the existence of diverse variations. Almost all of the clusters included both age groups, those under 50 years old and those 50 years and older, indicating that the use of sensory modalities varies among individuals regardless of age.Clinical relevance— These findings could provide foundational knowledge for developing sensory reweighting training programs tailored to specific sensory profiles, as well as for delivering clear and personalized feedback in health assessments."

    "abstract": "Blood pressure waveform analysis offers valuable insights into cardiovascular health, yet the complex interrelationships between waveform features and specific cardiovascular parameters remain incompletely understood. This study presents a systematic analysis of blood pressure waveform features using a validated cardiovascular simulator that accurately replicates pulse wave reflection phenomena and non-linear vascular mechanics. By precisely controlling key cardiovascular parameters—vascular elasticity, stroke volume, peripheral resistance, and heart rate—within physiologically realistic ranges, the independent effects of each parameter on waveform morphology were quantified. The simulator-based approach uniquely enabled exploration across the entire physiological spectrum, incorporating non-linear relationships that would be difficult to observe in traditional clinical studies. Sensitivity and stability analyses identified specific features highly responsive to vascular elasticity changes, with DownSlope and pulse pressure (PP) demonstrating both high sensitivity and stability. Clinical validation using waveform data from 78 human subjects confirmed that simulator-derived sensitivity patterns were observable in actual human waveforms, particularly the strong correlation between DownSlope and vascular elasticity as measured by pulse wave velocity. This physics-informed approach to feature selection provides valuable insights for non-invasive cardiovascular health monitoring applications and establishes a foundation for more interpretable and reliable machine learning models in cardiovascular assessment.Clinical Relevance— This enables clinicians to more accurately interpret pressure waveforms by providing clearer understanding of how elemental cardiovascular parameter changes are reflected on waveform features."

The circuit and PCB of paralleled devices must be carefully designed to optimize the current and loss sharing while avoiding oscillations. Apart from the power loop and devices themselves, the gate loop also plays a significant role, particularly when the dv/dt during the switching transient becomes very high. In this work, a simple model is proposed to analyze the impact of gate loop on the oscillations. Corresponding experimental measurements were also performed to verify the analysis results. In the end, a recommended optimization strategy is proposed, accordingly."

    "abstract": "Microwave medical imaging (MMI) has significant potential for stroke imaging due to its unique portability and timeliness, and is therefore highly valued by researchers. This paper proposes an imaging-process-informed generative strategy (IPIGS) that addresses the challenges posed by nonlinearity in the imaging process, thereby generating more intuitive and diagnosis-friendly microwave medical images. Aiming at the limitations of traditional imaging methods (e.g., distorted Born iterative method, DBIM), namely the blurry imaging background and the confusion of stroke areas, we first attribute this issue to the nonlinearity in the imaging process. That is, under certain circumstances, the dielectric constants of different brain tissues are misinterpreted by the DBIM imaging algorithm, resulting in incorrect imaging of stroke areas. Then, we establish a generalized model for this nonlinear problem, and introduce the corresponding a prior knowledge (APK), such as brain tissue information that is sensitive to changes in dielectric constants, into the generative adversarial network Pix2pix to restore the unclear imaging caused by this problem. The final results show that our method has a significant improvement over traditional methods in terms of the structural similarity and threshold segmentation effect, with an increase in structural similarity of 8% compared to traditional methods and an average increase in intersection-over-union of approximately 47%. This provides new possibilities for the restoration of microwave images."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a control framework for single-phase grid-connected electric vehicle (EV) charging using a Multi-Active Bridge (MAB) DC-DC converter that enables direct pulsating power processing and voltage balancing. In conventional systems, large DC-link capacitors are required to suppress low-frequency ripple originating from single-phase AC-DC rec-tifiers, increasing cost and reducing reliability. The proposed approach mitigates this by enabling the load-side battery to absorb ripple current directly, thereby reducing DC-link capacitance requirements. A Proportional-Integral-Resonant (PIR) controller, integrated with a decoupling matrix, ensures 120 Hz ripple current tracking and mitigates power cross-coupling among ports. A four-winding MAB topology is employed, where two high- voltage-side windings interface with series-connected Active Front-End (AFE) rectifiers, improving transformer utilization and supporting scalable multi-port operation. The controller further incorporates intra-bus voltage balancing to minimize circulating currents and improve power sharing accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and experimental studies on a DSP-controlled four-port MAB prototype. Results demonstrate up to 75% reduction in required DC-link capacitance, robust ripple power handling, and tight voltage regulation under both equal and unequal loading conditions."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that records electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. It provides high temporal resolution, making it valuable for studying brain dynamics, cognitive processes, and neurological disorders. EEG is widely used in clinical and research settings for diagnosing epilepsy, sleep disorders, and mental health conditions. However, EEG signals are often contaminated by artifacts from ocular, muscular, and environmental sources, complicating accurate analysis. Traditional artifact removal methods, such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and wavelet transform, require significant computational resources and manual tuning, limiting their effectiveness in real-time applications. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning-based framework for automated EEG denoising and simultaneous artifact removal while ensuring efficiency in real-time deployability. Various performance metrics such as relative-root-mean-square (RRMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and correlation, (CC) are measured to evaluate the model performance. The model achieves an average temporal and spectral RRMSE of 0.214 and 0.217 respectively, average SSIM of 0.964 and CC 0.963 of across various datasets. The model outperforms as compared to the state-of-the-art method with 295 × lesser parameters as compared to prior models. The model is able to denoise the EEG signals from various artifacts simultaneously. The proposed model demonstrates the potential for real-time deployment.

    "abstract": "Anaemia - a reduced concentration of functional haemoglobin in the blood - affects around 20% of the global population. As a result, there is focus on developing non-invasive methods to screen for anaemia. A promising group of techniques uses smartphone imaging of external tissues. Because haemoglobin preferentially reflects red light, by measuring the colour (‘redness’) of blood vessels (or tissues as a whole), it is suggested that blood haemoglobin may be estimated. However, a potential issue is that ‘redness’ might depend not just on the severity of anaemia, but also upon the ‘physiological structure’ - i.e. the vessel density, vessel depth, and vessel diameter. We performed Monte-Carlo tissue optics simulations to investigate the potential impact of these structural factors on measurement of colour in the scleral conjunctiva. We found that within reasonable ranges of physiological structure, it is possible to get similar redness between severely anaemic (2.35 g/dL) and non-anaemic (15 g/dL) blood haemoglobin concentrations. This suggests that simple measurement of the redness of external tissues may not be suitable for detecting anaemia.Clinical RelevancePallor of external tissue is commonly used as a hallmark of anaemia. These results suggest that pallor may arise not only from anaemia, but also from variation in the physiological structure of the eye."

Compared to ferrite cores, MC provides enhanced mechanical durability and flexibility, making it suitable for embedding in roadways and other structural applications. This review synthesizes recent advancements in MC, focusing on its composition, magnetic properties, and potential for large-scale applications. The main research findings indicate that commonly used binders for MC include cement, resin, and polyurethane, while the primary magnetic fillers are ferrite particles, iron powder, and nanocrystalline materials. Additionally, the effective magnetic permeability of MC is influenced by the intrinsic properties, volume fraction, and particle size of the magnetic materials, as well as the processing methods used. However, MC's permeability remains significantly lower than that of the base magnetic materials, typically ranging from 2.5 to 222. Finally, MC is still largely in the research stage, with limited commercial deployment, and its economic viability has yet to be fully established."

The proposed synchronous gate driver provides robustness against Short-Circuit Semiconductor Failures (SCSFs), which is the most common failure mechanism that can occur in any of the series-stacked devices, while eliminating the need for separate isolated power supplies to drive each switch. Additionally, through the operation of magnetic pulse compression employed on the gates of these devices, a high current can be delivered to the gate, resulting in improved switching performance. The functionality of the proposed synchronous gate driver system is validated through SPICE simulation results for 10 series connected SiC MOSFRTs."

    "abstract": "Gliomas are tumors originating from glial cells that support and protect neurons in the nervous system but can become malignant and quickly invade healthy brain tissue. Glioma subtypes have varying growth rates and respond differently to treatment options. Early identification of the subtype will help determine the treatment plan and can affect patient outcome. Some studies have differentiated between low-grade and highgrade gliomas, but limited studies have closely examined the factors that distinguish subtypes. Further, while clinical and radiographic features are commonly used for diagnosis, purely genomic approaches remain understudied. Thus, this study aims to leverage a mutation-driven machine learning classification pipeline to predict glioma subtypes based on genomic data. Data was extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), and a panel of 20 most frequently mutated genes in gliomas was analyzed to predict three major glioma subtypes: oligodendroglioma, astrocytoma, and glioblastoma. Three base models (multinomial logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were trained and evaluated independently. To further improve generalization and accuracy of classification, out-of-fold predictions from the base models were used to develop an ensemble XGBoost metamodel. The stacked model achieved an overall accuracy of 77.9 % and an AUC of 0.896, outperforming all the base models. Notably, the meta-model classified glioblastomas, the deadliest subtype, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 2. 2 \\%}$</tex> accuracy, highlighting the model's ability to identify high-grade tumors. Our findings illustrate the clinical potential that mutation-based classifiers hold and suggest that genetic features alone can hold strong predictive value for glioma subtype classification.

First, according to the operating characteristics of distinct DBPR ports, a simplified equivalent circuit model is established to achieve topological unification, which reduces the modeling complexity and improves feasibility. Then, the mixed potential function is constructed to derive the large-signal stability criterion for the DBPR, where the parameters affecting system stability can be identified. Finally, simulation results verify the correctness and accuracy of the proposed method."

The intermittent mode of dosing calls for a hybrid (continuous-discrete) modeling of the closed-loop system, where the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug are captured by differential equations whereas the control law is described by difference equations. Hybrid dynamics are highly nonlinear which complicates formal design of pulse-modulated feedback. This paper demonstrates complex nonlinear dynamical phenomena arising in a simple control system of dosing a neuromuscular blockade agent in anesthesia. Along with the nominal periodic regimen, undesirable nonlinear behaviors, i.e. periodic solutions of high multiplicity, multistability, as well as deterministic chaos, are shown to exist. It is concluded that design of feedback drug dosing algorithms based on a hybrid paradigm has to be informed by a thorough bifurcation analysis in order to secure patient safety.Clinical Relevance—The paper highlights potential patient safety risks posed by complex nonlinear phenomena in closed-loop drug administration.

In this paper, we propose, design, and evaluate a set of short training techniques (16-34 seconds) inspired by implicit learning techniques, to improve the usability of system-assigned PINs. We evaluated our designs in a two-session user study with 184 university students. Our results show that some designs offer significant improvements in the login success rate, login times, and user perceptions. These advantages are in addition to our design’s short single-session training, making it more compatible with typical registration workflows than previously proposed multisession training techniques."

    "abstract": "The demand for cuffless blood pressure monitoring is increasing in the clinical management of cardiovascular events. Currently, cuffless non-invasive devices for blood pressure control are widely used, with the primary research focus on enhancing the accuracy of blood pressure estimation using intelligent algorithms. This study aims to explore a cuffless method for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To this end, we propose a novel residual network framework based on dynamic convolution strategy and multi-scale convolutional attention enhancement mechanisms. The framework first utilizes dynamic convolution and channel adaptive mechanisms to extract low-level features from the PPG and ECG modalities. It then employs a novel parallel cross-mixing architecture that integrates residual blocks with a multi-scale attention block (MSAB), which complements a global attention mechanism to enhance the modeling of long-range dependencies. The proposed framework was validated on the VitalDB dataset, and experimental results demonstrate excellent performance in both SBP and DBP estimation tasks (SBP MAE ± SD: 3.83 ± 5.71 mmHg, DBP MAE ± SD: 2.29 ± 3.69 mmHg). The framework outperforms existing models and meets international blood pressure measurement standards, including those set by the American Association for Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)."

The heat sink includes internal pin fin structures to promote coolant flow, while the vapor chamber provides lateral heat spreading via vapor–liquid phase interactions. Experimental testing with approximately 80% fill level showed improved performance over the empty configuration, with the charged device maintaining chip surface temperatures below 62 °C up to 63 W. The corresponding thermal resistance ranged from 0.65 to 1.04 K/W, compared to 0.71 to 0.88 K/W in the empty case, representing a reduction of up to 22%.

    "abstract": "In neuroimaging-based Alzheimer's Disease (AD) diagnosis, effectively integrating structural MRI (sMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data while preserving clinical interpretability remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel transformer-based framework that unifies heterogeneous imaging features into coherent region-level representations. Our approach uniquely leverages prior anatomical knowledge to guide attention toward AD-relevant regions while employing a learnable mapping mechanism that transforms sMRI spatial features into biologically meaningful regional representations. We implement a consistency constraint to ensure optimal alignment between structural and functional coupling across modalities, followed by a Bayesian fusion strategy to integrate these aligned multi-modal features. Through comprehensive evaluation on the ADNI dataset, our method demonstrates not only superior diagnostic accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches but also provides clinically interpretable insights into AD-related brain connectivity patterns. This work represents a significant advancement in multi-modal neuroimaging analysis for AD diagnosis, successfully combining enhanced diagnostic performance with clinical interpretability."

    "abstract": "The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders (NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities—anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)—alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47%, outperforming baseline methods by over 10%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.Clinical Relevance— In neurological disorder (ND) research, a critical gap remains in mapping the continuum of disease progression, from prodromal conditions such as idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (iRBD) to fully developed disorders like Parkinson’s Disease (PD). A robust multimodal approach that seamlessly integrates diverse data modalities is essential for accurately predicting and understanding this progression. Advancements in this area would provide the foundation for developing models capable of distinguishing overlapping disease states (e.g., PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy) and predicting the transition from presymptomatic conditions like iRBD to established NDs."

    "abstract": "Patients with bladder cancer typically require both a transurethral examination and surgery, and accurate recording of information observed during a transurethral examination is necessary for surgery. However, observational recordings are made manually and depend on the physician’s ability, and the digital information gathered during the examination is not fully utilized in surgery. To address these issues, this study aimed to propose a free-viewpoint bladder observation system for cystoscopy based on multi-view image-based three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. We used neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) to develop the proposed system as 3D reconstruction methods. Although these methods are state-of-the-art in the field of 3D reconstruction, adapting them to a small dome-shaped bladder is challenging; there needs to be an assumption that the inputs of these methods are the sets of images of the same region captured from multiple viewpoints. To overcome this problem, by classifying the images into bladder dome and neck areas and reconstructing each location, we obtained the entire 3D bladder model. This approach leads to the generation of free-viewpoint images of the whole bladder. We present the results of a comparative study concerning the possibility of preserving examination records. Our findings indicated that NeRF outperformed 3DGS in terms of texture reproducibility, and that reconstruction through dividing area of the bladder was successful in generating free-viewpoint inner images."

While deep learning has advanced coronary artery segmentation, current algorithms exhibit persistent limitations: excessive output smoothing and inadequate fusion of localized details with global contextual information, frequently causing segmentation leakage or discontinuity. To resolve these challenges, we propose FSUNet3+, a frequency-aware architecture that synergizes highfrequency boundary cues with low-frequency anatomical patterns. Through frequency decomposition and adaptive feature recalibration, our framework enhances multi-scale representation learning while explicitly modeling spectral complementarity. Complementing this design, we develop a Cascaded MultiScale Strip Convolution (CMSC) block, leveraging elongated kernels to preserve vascular connectivity in branching structures. The hierarchical convolution cascade enables cross-scale feature interaction, improving geometric reasoning of complex vessel networks. Benchmark evaluations on the XCAD dataset confirm our method's effectiveness in maintaining topological integrity while capturing subtle textural variations, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over contemporary segmentation baselines."

This approach enhances an off-policy actor-critic algorithm known as Primal-Dual Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with the addition of dual variables to bound critical parameters within clinically acceptable ranges. The proposed technique first creates a high-fidelity computational model (digital twin) of the patient, so that physiological reactions to changes in ventilator settings can be generated in silico to train the RL controller quickly and safely. Once brought online, the novel primal-dual SAC then safely converges to ventilator settings that minimize the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), while guaranteeing that the patient’s physiological parameters remain within specified safety limits. Correct and robust functioning of the proposed controller is demonstrated by detailed simulations based on real patient data.Clinical relevance— Closed-loop ventilation has been demonstrated to reduce clinician workload, improve patient-ventilator synchrony, and shorten weaning duration in certain settings. However, most existing closed-loop ventilation modes focus solely on achieving oxygenation targets, offering no assurance of minimizing VILI indices or maintaining them within safe limits. In this study, we address this limitation by introducing a safety-guaranteed closed-loop ventilation technique."

    "abstract": "Given the increasing complexity of omics datasets, a key challenge is not only improving classification performance but also enhancing the transparency and reliability of model decisions. Effective model performance and feature selection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases, high-dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to clinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others conditions. Current omics-based classification models often suffer from narrow interpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where trust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning-based classification framework that integrates feature selection with data augmentation techniques to achieve high-standard classification accuracy while ensuring better interpretability. Using the publicly available dataset E-MTAB-8026, we explore a bootstrap analysis in six binary classification scenarios to evaluate the proposed model’s behaviour. We show that the proposed pipeline yields cross-validated perfomance on small dataset that is conserved when the trained classifier is applied to a larger test set. Our findings emphasize the fundamental balance between accuracy and feature selection, highlighting the positive effect of introducing synthetic data for better generalization, even in scenarios with very limited samples availability.Clinical relevance— The proposed framework addresses a critical challenge in omics-based disease classification by improving model interpretability while maintaining high classification performance. By providing a more explainable data-driven approach, this study contributes to the development of reliable and reproducible diagnostic tools that can support clinical decision-making."

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of wearable EEG technology is enabling the development of passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) systems for real-world applications, in the near future, such as Industry 5.0. However, one major challenge in classifying electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in these settings is covariate shift, which occurs when the distribution of the data changes between training and testing sessions due to variations in EEG headset positioning. This study investigates the effectiveness of a linear transformation approach to mitigate the negative effect of covariate shift. Simulations were conducted by using different shift conditions (i.e. deviation of the headset position from the original one), to evaluate (i) the performance of the transformation function used for mitigating the covariate shift occurrence and (ii) the importance that the change of reference and/or channels has on the classification performance. Results show that normalizing covariate shift-affected data (i.e., target) using shift-free data as a template (i.e., source) helps mitigate the negative impact of covariate shift, leading to improved classification performanceThe accuracy loss drops from 14% to 6% in the worst configuration and from 5% to 4% in the best configuration. This improvement is more pronounced when the shift is larger, i.e., when both the reference and channels change between the control dataset and the test dataset. These findings have significant implications for the development of robust and reliable pBCI models for out-of-the-lab contexts."

Traditional layout algorithms [2], which prioritize wirelength minimization, inherently suffer from delayed timing path optimization and insufficient accuracy in critical path identification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a distributed deep reinforcement learning architecture that achieves a breakthrough in layout quality through a three-stage innovative mechanism. First, an adaptive grid partitioning strategy based on timing criticality is designed to construct a hierarchical layout decision space. Second, a gradientsharing mechanism across agents is introduced to effectively address the policy convergence issue under sparse reward conditions. Finally, a dynamic neighborhood communication model is established to achieve the co-evolution of local optimization and global timing constraints. In the ICCAD-2015 benchmark test, this study's method demonstrates significant advantages over DREAMPlace4.0: the total negative slack (TNS) is optimized by 12.39%, the worst negative slack (WNS) is improved by 1.66%, and the runtime is reduced by 26.71%. The experimental results indicate that the distributed collaborative learning mechanism can effectively break through the bottleneck in solution space exploration efficiency inherent in traditional single-agent reinforcement learning."

    "abstract": "Learning and memory are fundamental brain functions governed by rhythmic oscillatory activity, which synchronizes neural communication and modulates network dynamics. Distinct oscillatory patterns—theta (θ), beta (β), gamma (γ), and sharp wave-ripples (SWR)—coordinate neural ensemble activity, particularly in the hippocampal CA1-CA3 regions, where they play a crucial role in learning and memory. Understanding the mechanisms underlying SWR generation is crucial, as these oscillations play a fundamental role in memory consolidation, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. Unlike previous small-scale studies that relied on limited electrode coverage, our approach leverages high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs) to capture SWRs across large-scale hippocampal networks. This enables a direct comparison of how different induction methods influence network-wide dynamics, rather than focusing on isolated neuronal activity. By quantitatively assessing spatiotemporal propagation, frequency distributions, and ensemble synchronization, we aim to determine whether experimentally evoked SWRs truly replicate the functional characteristics of their spontaneous counterparts or introduce distinct network properties. Our findings provide a critical foundation for interpreting SWR activity in both physiological and experimental settings, offering novel insights into large-scale neural dynamics and their implications for memory-related processes and therapeutic interventions."

However, its performance is often compromised by several dynamic factors, including gesture intensity, limb position, electrode shift, and signal non-stationarities. This work introduces and investigates skin temperature as the \"fifth\" dynamic factor influencing sEMG-based gesture recognition. Synchronized sEMG, photoplethys-mography (PPG), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data were recorded from 12 participants without limb differences performing five hand/wrist gestures under three temperature conditions (cold, baseline, and hot) using the BioPoint wearable device. Analysis revealed that cold conditions increased the mean absolute value and reduced the median frequency of sEMG signals, while the signal’s complexity (assessed via fuzzy entropy) remained largely unchanged. Gesture recognition models trained exclusively on baseline data showed a decline in accuracy when tested on non-baseline temperature conditions. In contrast, training with temperature-diverse data improved classification robustness across thermal conditions, albeit at the cost of baseline performance. Furthermore, while a multisensor approach combining EMG, PPG, and IMU data enhanced baseline accuracy, it also demonstrated heightened sensitivity to temperature variations. These findings underscore the necessity for skin temperature-aware strategies for the development of robust sEMG-based gesture recognition systems. Additionally, we introduce a novel hand gesture dataset collected under varying skin temperature conditions to support future research on developing more adaptive and reliable gesture recognition solutions."

This setup converts 250 V DC to 240/120 V AC for grid and household integration while maintaining a stable 400 V DC link. A novel Dynamic Duty Cycle Adjustment mechanism enhances the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm by dynamically adjusting to sudden irradiance changes, improving tracking performance, and avoiding local maxima traps, particularly under partial shading conditions. Additionally, a novel dq-frame with a fractional order-based dynamic PI anti-windup (FO-DPI-AW) mechanism stabilizes the system during grid disturbances and load fluctuations, which are common in rural settings. The proposed system meets IEEE power quality (PQ) standards, ensuring voltage regulation within ±5 % and achieving over 96% PV utilization even under load fluctuations.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel compensation topology for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems considering vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation. During V2G operation, maintaining power quality supplied to the grid is critical. However, the conventional double-sided LCC topology in EV IPT systems has a constant current (CC) characteristic, making it difficult to maintain the DC link voltage as the battery state of charge decreases. To solve this limitation, this paper presents a new topology utilizing a switched controlled capacitor (SCC). The proposed topology modifies the resonant network configuration through the SCC, enabling both CC and constant voltage (CV) outputs. Additionally, the system can operate efficiently through zero phase angle operation and zero voltage switching. To validate the feasibility of the proposed design, a 3.3 kW prototype was developed. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system achieves both CC and CV operations, delivering power with a maximum efficiency of 93.42%."

Although preferred by patients, this method faces challenges such as capsule retention requiring surgical removal and suboptimal imaging resulting in false negative diagnoses. This work investigates the feasibility of controlling a magnetic capsule endoscope within the GI-tract by use of a robotically controlled, extracorporeal, rotating permanent magnet. A dynamic model was developed by incorporating both contact forces (friction, damping, and spring forces) and non-contact forces (magnetic forces and torques), which were then used to predict the magnetic capsule’s behaviour. The model was then validated via use of frequency response testing in and outside a realistic bowel phantom. Open-loop testing within the bowel phantom further evaluated the system’s ability to navigate the GI tract. The results demonstrate that the method is feasible, and repeatable trials could be performed traversing the entire bowel phantom in under 600 s. Furthermore, the validation demonstrated that an accurate theoretical representation of the magnetic capsules behaviour is achievable, enabling precise prediction of the necessary actuation inputs."

Transitioning from custom 3D-printed hardware, GlauCUTU-WebXR integrates an improved prediction model that enhances sensitivity predictions using positional features (position index: PID) and severity classification metadata (SeverityScore). These additions help the model capture positional and severity-specific patterns, which, in turn, significantly improve prediction accuracy in converting GlauCUTU sensitivity to Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) sensitivity. The model trained and validated on 97 eyes (47 patients) and tested on 24 eyes (12 patients) with varying glaucoma severity, it achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.3398, root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.6614, and a Pearson correlation of 0.8033. The system significantly reduced testing time compared to HFA (p<0.001). GlauCUTU-WebXR shows no significant differences in results compared to HFA across severity levels: none (p=0.8750), mild (p=0.5888), moderate (p=0.9153), and severe (p=0.9958). By utilizing commercial VR hardware and enhanced prediction models, GlauCUTU-WebXR provides a cost-effective, efficient alternative for glaucoma screening, particularly in resource-limited settings, demonstrating its potential to improve accessibility and early detection efforts."

    "abstract": "Human body communication (HBC), as an energy-efficient alternative to radio-frequency (RF) communications, was extensively explored in terms of its channel variability in the electro quasi-static (EQS) band. The body resonance (BR) region, offering larger channel gain and bandwidth, potentially enables higher-speed data transfer, further improving HBC channel capability and energy efficiency. However, BR HBC channel variability still needs considerable exploration. This paper comprehensively analyzes BR HBC channel variability across different device positions, postures, and device sizes, including ground sizes and separations between signal and ground electrodes, through simulation and measurement with miniaturized wearable devices at 30 MHz∼300 MHz. Results show larger ground sizes and electrode separations increase the channel gain by up to 20.5 dB. The channel gain is reduced when devices are close to the torso, but it improves when they are positioned on the same arm or in direct line-of-sight. These findings demonstrate that factors affecting the EQS HBC channel also apply to BR HBC, facilitating further understanding of BR HBC channel characteristics."

This alternative is proposed as a faster alternative to circuit-coupled finite element analysis and other ROMs now in use while preserving a similar level of model fidelity during transient analysis. Machine current waveforms obtained from this simulation for steady-state conditions are provided as input to a finite-element model of the same motor to calculate PWM-induced losses in the machine windings, magnets, and core. Several combinations of torque and speed have been considered, and machine loss components are compared across different inverter types. The impact of switching frequency variation has also been studied. The CSI is predicted to deliver the lowest machine losses for nearly all of the operating conditions, with the MVSI drive emerging as a strong competitor."

    "abstract": "Patched inference is a widely used technique in machine learning (ML) that enables fixed-shape models to process arbitrarily large or variably sized inputs by dividing them into smaller, compatible patches. This approach is particularly useful in domains such as seismic processing, medical imaging, and electron microscopy, where data samples often exceed the memory capacity of individual computing nodes. While patched inference is effective for leveraging pre-trained models and operating on resource-constrained hardware, there remains a lack of tools supporting its efficient, distributed execution at scale.To address this gap, we introduce SPINN (Scalable Parallel INference Network), a Python library designed to streamline and accelerate patched inference on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. SPINN supports data partitioning, patch-wise processing using user-defined ML models, and result aggregation, all while leveraging distributed computing frameworks such as Dask and Ray.We validate SPINN on two seismic interpretation tasks, fault detection and facies segmentation, using both public and large-scale private data (up to 272 GB). Experiments demonstrate that SPINN enables smoother prediction outputs via overlapping patches and achieves superlinear scalability with Dask in HPC environments, significantly outperforming conventional solutions such as the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server in large-scale scenarios. SPINN thus emerges as a robust and scalable solution for applying deep learning inference to massive data samples in memory-constrained or compute-intensive settings."

This study examines age-related changes in body composition in C57BL/6 mice to explore the relationship between lean mass, total mass, and age-related weakness. Using the EchoMRI-500 body composition analyzer, we measured lean mass and correlated it with independently measured total mass across different age groups (young, middle aged, and old) and sexes (male and female). Our results show that both lean and total mass increase progressively with age in both sexes. However, the lean-to-total mass ratio declines with age, reflecting the reduction in lean mass observed in humans. Additionally, male mice were consistently more muscular than female mice in old age. Specifically, the lean-to-total mass ratios were 0.525 for male mice and 0.203 for female mice. These data provide a simple yet accurate approach for estimating lean mass from total mass, offering a valuable tool for studying age-related weakness."

Previous work demonstrated HILO’s efficacy in simulation, but its performance with human participants remains untested. Here we evaluate HILO using sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision to assess its ability to optimize stimulation strategies under realistic conditions. Participants selected between phosphenes generated by competing encoders to iteratively refine a deep stimulus encoder (DSE). We tested HILO in three conditions: standard optimization, threshold misspecifications, and out-of-distribution parameter sampling. Participants consistently preferred HILO-generated stimuli over both a naïve encoder and the DSE alone, with log odds favoring HILO across all conditions. We also observed key differences between human and simulated decision-making, highlighting the importance of validating optimization strategies with human participants. These findings support HILO as a viable approach for adapting visual prostheses to individuals.Clinical Relevance—Validating HILO with sighted participants viewing simulated prosthetic vision is an important step toward personalized calibration of future visual prostheses."

    "abstract": "In electrified railways, the neutral section is a weak link in the traction power supply. Its existence can lead to issues such as train power interruption and overvoltage problems. Automatic Neutral Section Power Supplier (ANSPS) system is a low-cost solution to the issues of the power interruption and speed loss caused by the neutral section in electrified railways. Although existing ANSPS systems can provide uninterrupted power supply, they lack the ability to simultaneously achieve continuous Railway Power Conditioner (RPC) function and maintain small device capacity. Some systems even require large-capacity phase-shifting transformers, resulting in generally high costs. In this paper, a novel ANSPS system based on partial capacity converter is proposed, which can provide uninterrupted power supply during the whole process of train driving, while maintaining high power quality on the grid side, and the required converter capacity is relatively small. This paper introduces the structure and control principle of the system, and then compares the capacity. The simulation has been developed to verify the effectiveness of proposed ANSPS system and its control."

    "abstract": "There are two dc link configurations in paralleled high-power adjustable speed drives (ASDs): (1). The dc links of all paralleled inverters are connected, where the circulation currents caused by unbalanced output inductors and hardware variation flow through the dc link; (2). The dc links are independent of each other, where the high frequency circulating currents can overcharge the dc link capacitors on individual system, thus degrading system reliability. In each configuration, circulating current may flow between the inverters due to pulse width modulation (PWM) carrier shift between paralleled ASDs, or caused by hardware variations such as output inductors tolerance, semiconductor rise/fall time, deadtime, etc. This paper introduces unified modeling and controller solutions mitigating circulation currents effectively in both types of dc link configurations. Simulation studies are conducted on two 370kW, 460V, 590A ASDs and induction motor (IM) load to verify theoretical findings. An experimental setup using two 3.6kW paralleled ASDs with a three-phase RL load is established to validate both theory and simulation results."

Implanted PPG systems offer the possibility to measure similar real-time measures of cardiovascular health, however, the detection method may vary due to a lack of capillary vessels for PPG sensors to observe in muscle tissue. To improve volumetric blood detection in large muscles, without relying on the capillary density of skin, a flexible PPG sensor was developed. The sensor included multiple spacing of illuminating infrared (IR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a single IR photodetector. This arrangement was expected to enable detection of blood volume changes at variable distances from the sensor face, potentially at much longer depths then feasible with skin-mounted PPG devices. IR bench phantoms simulating a large blood vessel embedded in IR absorbing, tissue-mimicking rubber were developed and used to determine the sensor performance in vitro. A preliminary in vivo test used an adult rabbit to provide additional performance validation. Test results reveal an observed trend of increased SNR for deeper vessel depths for the farthest LED to detector spacing which is aligned with our initial prediction. However, ANOVA and post-hoc tests reveal that these trends did not reach statistical significance. The in vivo test showed a relationship consistent with relevant literature. Future experiments are required to improve the phantom’s representation of the biological setting and to confirm a reduced SNR variation for the farthest spacing.Clinical Relevance—Development of a subcutaneous, continuous blood pressure sensor may provide benefits towards monitoring autonomic dysreflexia and hypertension for people affected by spinal cord injury."

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening and heterogeneous disease characterized by dysregulated host responses to infection. Although recent studies applied unsupervised algorithms to uncover sepsis phenotypes, the clustering process lacks the ability to incorporate clinical knowledge, potentially resulting in phenotypes with limited interpretability. We propose a novel clustering framework, naviDCN, which integrates a navigator component to align clusters with clinical significance. The naviDCN architecture comprises multi-modal encoders, a deep clustering network (DCN) with reconstruction tasks, and a navigator module. We first encode electronic health records into representative embeddings by introducing an attention mechanism on multi-modal information. The framework then iteratively optimizes network weights of reconstruction and navigator modules, and updates cluster centroids of the clustering module. The navigator incorporates clinical knowledge into the embedding through backpropagation, thereby guiding clustering toward clinically meaningful outcomes. We discover four sepsis phenotypes with unique clinical characteristics, SOFA trajectories, and mortality patterns. Notably, while both α and δ phenotypes show severe conditions in the early stage, naviDCN effectively differentiates between patients likely to show clinical improvement (α) and those at risk of deterioration (δ).Furthermore, the navigator effectively enhances phenotype interpretability without compromising objective clustering performance. This study offers insights into understanding the heterogeneity of sepsis phenotypes.Clinical Relevance-This study integrates a navigator module into the clustering framework to identify phenotypes with distinct short-term organ dysfunction trajectories and long-term survival status, thus improving the interpretability of sepsis phenotypes. Unraveling the latent information in demographics, laboratory test results, and vital signs with deep learning, our framework identifies characteristic phenotypes and opens new avenues for exploring targeted treatment for sepsis patients across phenotypes."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development and evaluation of a web application for facial detection and image processing, designed to profile senior citizens in Naga City, Philippines. The system integrates the Haar Cascade Algorithm and OpenCV, advanced facial recognition technologies, to automate data entry, reduce human error, and enhance data security in barangay services. The study follows the Iterative Model in the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), refining the system's functionality through multiple iterations. A usability test conducted at Barangay Calauag assessed the system's performance in terms of usability, accuracy, reliability, and security. Initial results revealed significant challenges in system reliability, particularly due to uncontrolled lighting conditions. However, following system enhancements, reliability improved, and strong agreement was observed across all evaluation metrics. The final system demonstrated a notable increase in profiling efficiency, a significant reduction in human error, and improved security measures for senior citizen transactions. These findings confirm that the system can streamline data collection, enhance service delivery, and improve overall user satisfaction. The paper suggests continued collaboration with local authorities to optimize system performance, refine facial recognition under varying conditions, and ensure long-term support for the senior population of Naga City."

    "abstract": "We are developing deep learning models for extracting specular and speckle signal components in medical ultrasound echo signals and for quantitatively estimating acoustic properties such as reflection and scattering. The model reported in this paper is based on an autoencoder, which is similar to the single-task model we have separately developed, it is characterized by the fact that it is a bifurcation multitask model, which is oriented to efficiently separate signal components and acoustic properties with high accuracy. The model parameters can be significantly reduced, for instance, 118.5M to 95M. Moreover, the model is improved by integrating the well-known pre-trained ResNet-50 encoder and employing the SSIM (structural similarity index measure) for better training and evaluation. In addition, a trainable shared loss is introduced to reduce the degradation of learning performance due to imbalance in the magnitude of loss for each task. As a result, the improved model outperforms the original single-task models in terms of signal component separation and acoustic property estimation with an average improvement of 0.352 and 0.279 in the SSIM metric, respectively.Clinical Relevance— This study is relevant for clinical use as it is able to give insight on the improvement of ultrasound imaging using deep learning. With further research, echo signals and acoustic properties could be more effectively utilized in clinical diagnosis."

Investigating the connectivity processes arising in brain networks can provide important advances in basic as well as applied neuroscience. In this study, we present a brain-on-a-chip model based on two important features of the living brain: three-dimensionality and heterogeneity. We used neuronal networks derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and computed the functional connectivity properties of homogeneous (composed of excitatory neurons only) as well as heterogeneous (composed of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) human-derived neurospheroids. We found that inhibition affected the topology of the neuronal cultures by increasing the number of connections, while both models exhibited small-world properties. This work has laid the foundation for future studies aimed at exploring connectivity-related impairments."

    "abstract": "With the development of intelligent vehicles and big data technology, the research on coordination of intelligent platoons has become an important issue, which could improve the system efficiency and reduce energy consumption. However, the stability and security of the communication within the platoons have become a very important problem to be settled. Motivated by these observations, the zero-trust framework with its “never trust, always verify” principle has gradually become an important tool to ensure the reliability of intelligent platoons. According to the studies of the communication topology of the intelligent connected vehicles, when analyzing the vulnerability of the communication network, the faulty situation and the probability of fault occurrence both should be considered. Based on this, this paper analyzes the vulnerability of communication topological network and defines criticality index. Then, according to the trust evaluation results of the nodes, the vulnerability estimation function of network topology under zero-trust framework is analyzed comprehensively. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed scheme is verified by a simulation experiment."

Despite its clinical importance, MAP is often estimated using empirical formulas in routine practice, which may lead to inaccuracies. While previous studies have highlighted MAP’s dynamic interactions with other physiological signals, the fast, within-beat relationships between MAP and blood pressure measurements - systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) - remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study leverages an information-theoretic framework based on partial information decomposition (PID) to dissect the unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions of SAP and DAP to MAP in healthy subjects during a protocol of postural stress. Two alternative definitions of redundancy were applied, yielding consistent findings. Specifically, an increase in redundancy during tilt and a dominant role of DAP in shaping MAP were documented across experimental conditions."

Most measurements disease severity measure these separately, but there is a need in clinical trials and clinical research for measures that account for all these domains in a single score. This study introduces a novel multiview framework leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from three instrumented devices, the Ataxia Instrumented Measures (AIMs) — cup (AIM-C), spoon (AIM-S), and pendent (AIM-P)—to enhance ataxia severity assessment of FRDA. Regression models based on individual devices demonstrated Pearson correlations of 0.83, 0.749, and 0.77 with the modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS), respectively. A multiview model integrating data across all three devices yielded a significantly improved correlation of 0.94, generating the Aggregated IMU Multiview Score (AIM-M). AIM-M offers a robust, scalable, and objective metric for quantifying FRDA severity, outperforming existing single-view approaches. These findings indicate that multiview IMU-based systems can provide sensitive and reliable assessments of severity of ataxia in FRDA.Clinical relevance—This study presents a multiview IMU-based approach that can enhances the objective assessment of severity of ataxia in FRDA."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning based brain machine interfaces (RLBMIs) is an emerging technology with many possible real-time applications. Transfer learning (TL) has proved beneficial as it can improve performance of machine learning algorithms by reusing learned knowledge from similar tasks. However, its application in BMIs has mainly focused on supervised learning approaches. In this study, we investigate the effect of TL in RLBMIs to decode freewill movement related intentions using multichannel scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). We applied TL strategies to Q-learning Kernel Temporal Difference (Q-KTD), which is an algorithm to estimate the action value function, Q, by a nonlinear function approximator using kernel methods. A publicly available EEG dataset recorded while healthy adult participants conduct a key pressing task was used to decode premovement (before movement onset) and movement intention (after movement onset). Differently from most cue-based tasks, participants had freewill to choose the key being pressed, providing unique neural dynamics for decoding. TL was applied between and within subjects to decode the movement related intentions. Significant increase on success rates (p < 0.01) were observed in 96% cases. The success rate increases in each case ranged from 1.39 to 10.69%. These results support the use of TL as an effective way to improve the efficiency of RL-based neural decoder’s learning.Clinical Relevance— The improved performance of the neural decoder using transfer learning provides efficient modeling strategy of RLBMIs that can assist patients with neurological disorders."

    "abstract": "Automatic classification of breast cancer (BrCan) histopathological images is crucial for aiding BrCan diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks often emphasize semantics, however, they face challenges like high computational cost, high memory usage, and difficulty in capturing multiscale features, making them less suitable for resource-constrained clinical applications. Many past researchers have proposed CNN-based deep learning model for BrCan classification. Though these models achieved good classification performance, they are heavy regarding parameter counts, FLOPS, and model size. This paper presents a lightweight model with performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. It integrates Depthwise-Dilated-Multiscale-Pointwise (DDMP) blocks, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to capture low-level and high-level discriminative features. The DDMP blocks efficiently extract multiscale features using depthwise convolution, multiscale dilated convolutions, and pointwise convolutions. This is followed by dual-stream architecture combining the LL subband of DWT with max-pooling output. These features are then recalibrated using SE blocks to highlight the most significant features. The proposed model consists of two DDMP-SE blocks, followed by Global Average Pooling, dense layers with GELU activation, and a final soft-max layer for binary classification. An ablation study further highlights the impact of epochs, activation functions, and batch sizes. BreastHistoNet outperforms other baseline models in terms of model size (7.47 MB), parameter count (0.63 M), and FLOPS (6.50 G). Experimental results on BreaKHis dataset obtain 95.48% accuracy, 95.61% precision, 95.46% specificity, 95.46% recall, and 95.48% F1-score. The performance of BreastHistoNet offers high accuracy while maintaining low computational complexity and minimal memory usage makes it a valuable tool for accurate and efficient BrCan classification."

By dynamically varying the DC-link voltage and utilizing six-step operation with extremely low switching frequency, the proposed method leverages soft-switching characteristics to significantly reduce switching losses. This enables the converter to supply twice the fault current within the same junction temperature margin without exceeding the thermal limits of semiconductor devices, thereby improving transient overcurrent capability without hardware modifications. The proposed method also ensures appropriate reactive power injection to support grid voltage recovery and maintain compliance with grid code requirements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through offline simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing."

We analyzed cardiac magnetic signals from 565 patients (336 cases clinically diagnosed as IHD and 229 non-IHD cases). After data preprocessing including noise suppression and data format conversion, 2,317 features were extracted from ST segments and T-waves across time domain, frequency domain, isomagnetic maps, and current density maps to ensure the comprehensive mining of cardiac magnetic signals. Feature screening was conducted using univariate tests and four predictors: LASSO regression, random forest, Minimum Redundancy, Maximum relevance, and Light Gradient Boosting machine. Ultimately, 18 of the most distinctive features were retained for modeling. We compared the performance of different machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost and Neural Network. The results showed that for the detection of IHD, random forest achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.87, sensitivity of $91 \\%$, specificity of $74 \\%$ and accuracy of $84 \\%$, with an $F 1$ score of $87 \\%$. The model interpretation by the SHAP algorithm indicated roundness of positive and negative poles of T-wave peaks from isomagnetic map made major contributions to IHD classification.

A bi-objective (loss and weight) optimization strategy was automated in MATLAB using prebuilt libraries of EE cores, reluctance model, and candidate PCB layout designs to achieve the desired loss-weight performance. However, high-current planar PCB inductors often have increased equivalent parasitic capacitance (EPC) because their flat winding structures employed to reduce winding losses by maximizing copper usage.

In this work, we observe that existing feature-level attack methods typically generate attribution maps from low-resolution feature maps, resulting in coarse and imprecise attributions that fail to capture critical discriminative cues such as object boundaries and small-scale targets. This limits the spatial precision and transferability of perturbations. Based on this finding, we propose a novel training-free feature-level attack method, termed Gradient-aware Upsampled Neuron Attribution Attack (GUNA). GUNA constructs a nonlinear attribution trajectory via a gradient-norm-based adaptive noise injection mechanism, producing a sequence of intermediate feature maps. These maps are then upsampled to enhance spatial resolution before attribution computation, enabling more precise and trans-ferable perturbations. Extensive experiments on both standard and adversarially trained models demonstrate that GUNA achieves superior attack success rates. Moreover, GUNA can be seamlessly integrated into existing attack frameworks, significantly enhancing the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly in defending against polymorphic malware. Polymorphic malware, which dynamically alters its code to evade traditional detection mechanisms, poses a critical threat to IoT networks due to their resource constraints and heterogeneity. Existing solutions, such as signature-based detection and static AI models, are often ineffective against evolving malware variants and lack real-time detection capabilities. To address these limitations, this study proposes an adaptive AI-driven cybersecurity framework specifically designed for real-time detection of polymorphic malware in IoT networks. The framework leverages a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal analysis, along with adaptive learning mechanisms to handle evolving threats. Additionally, federated learning is incorporated to enable decentralized model training, ensuring scalability and data privacy. Evaluated on modern datasets such as CICIDS2017 and IoT-23, the framework achieves an accuracy of 95.6%, precision of 94.8%, recall of 96.2%, and an F1-score of 95.5%, with a detection time of just 25 milliseconds. These results demonstrate the framework's superior performance compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods, making it a robust solution for enhancing IoT security. This research contributes to the field by addressing critical gaps in real-time detection, adaptability, and scalability, while also highlighting opportunities for future improvements in ultra-low-power device compatibility and zero-day threat detection."

While there are challenges to be addressed, there are also opportunities for innovation and improvement in the education system. This study aims to understand learners' experiences with e-learning during the digital transformation of education. The research objectives focus on leveraging sentiment analysis to analyze the learners' sentiments toward e-learning. The study used a mixedmethods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. Data were collected using eight (8) open-ended questions and analyzed using machine learning techniques. Results show that there is a 0.52 positive sentiment score for learner's recommendations on digital transformation while challenges have the least positive sentiment score of 0.32; comments on online tools have the highest negative score of 0.23, while influence has the least negative score. The findings also suggest that learners' sentiment towards e-learning is influenced by factors such as the quality of learning materials, the platform's usability, connectivity, the online environment, and the level of interaction in the online class. The study concludes with recommendations for improving e-learning based on the identified factors that affect learners' sentiments."

    "abstract": "The evaluation of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) expression is of paramount importance for the precise treatment of breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the established gold standard for HER2 assessment, but it does come with substantial costs. To alleviate the requirement for costly IHC tests, this paper develops a groundbreaking patch-level feature encoder called HI-MAE, for the first time, that makes use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and IHC information in pre-training masked autoencoder (MAE) for more effective feature encoding in H&E stained images. The HI-MAE integrated with various multiple instance learning (MIL) models enables the direct prediction of HER2 status from H&E stained whole slide images (WSIs). Through evaluation on the TCGA-BRCA dataset, we demonstrate a significant improvement in HER2 status prediction by integrating IHC information into the feature encoding for H&E stained images, with the AUC increasing from 0.59 to 0.74. Our HI-MAE model opens new avenues for future research, facilitating the incorporation of IHC information into other classification tasks, particularly for precise biomarker predictions.Clinical relevance— By incorporating IHC images into the pre-training process, we enable the prediction of HER2 status directly from routine H&E-stained tissue sections under the guidance of IHC information, thereby eliminating the need for IHC images during the testing phase. This approach significantly reduces the staining costs associated with IHC."

The design and deployment of a LoRa-based wireless monitoring system is presented in this work. It is intended for environments where traditional communication methods are constrained by factors like distance, obstacles, or signal interference. Using an architecture based on Arduino Mega for local sensor control, NodeMCU (ESP8266) for Wi-Fi connectivity and integration with Arduino IoT Cloud, and LoRa for reliable, long-range communication, the developed project provides an effective and scalable smart home monitoring solution. This combination makes it possible to use modern interfaces for monitoring important environmental parameters in real time from any place, including temperature, humidity, light, and gas emissions. Performance testing in real-world circumstances is discussed together with the implementation steps, from prototype to experimental product. The results also prove a reliable operation and strong transmission stability, indicating the system's potential for usage in smart homes, especially in rural or isolated areas where traditional wireless networks are useless.

We propose a novel framework for FoG detection and prediction using wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors, collected from 40 Parkinson’s patients. Our approach leverages a Dilated Temporal Encoder (DTE) that integrates Bidirectional Dilated Temporal Convolutional Networks (Bi-DTCN), attention mechanisms, and an auxiliary loss targeting the time segment preceding a FoG (Pre-FoG). Using patient-dependent (PD) training and test sets, we systematically analyzed the effect of varying Pre-FoG segment lengths (2–5 seconds), which allowed us to identify 5 seconds as the optimal window, with a robust F1 score of 91.33 ± 0.98%. This anticipatory window has practical clinical implications, enabling timely interventions such as cueing or stopping before freezing occurs. Conversely, under patient-independent (PI) settings, experiments highlighted challenges in generalization, with performance peaking at an F1 score of 62.90 ± 1.88%. In order to address this, we introduced a performance-based clustering strategy that identified subgroups of patients with shared gait characteristics, improving cross-patient performance from 52.24 ± 2.37% to 59.62 ± 1.92%. These findings highlight the potential of combining individualized modeling and subgroup generalization to support proactive FoG management and improve patient safety."

We show that, although the formal definition has changed, the operational procedures of ETN 02-12 in the range −40 °C to 961 °C remain largely unaffected; the additional uncertainty propagated from the fixed value of the Boltzmann constant to the triple point of water is negligible in practice. In the longer term, the constant-based SI enables advances in primary thermometry and supports future quantum-based realizations."

    "abstract": "Image classification task is an important task in the field of machine learning in artificial intelligence technology at present, and with the continuous development of big data and large-scale model, more and more various image data needs to be classified. When training the classification model, due to the large amount of data required, the structure of collected samples is miscellaneous, and it is easy to be interfered by noise and other factors, there will inevitably be some low-quality data that is difficult to process. Some of these data are ambiguous in categories, and some are too fuzzy or too low in resolution to judge their categories. During model training and classification tasks, they will affect model performance and classification accuracy. At the same time, few-shot problems will appear in many real scenarios and large-scale models may be unsuitable for solving them. How to filter these data effectively is an urgent problem to be solved in current few-shot image classification tasks. In this paper, a few-shot image classification method for filtering low-quality data is proposed in the classification task. Correction based on confidence threshold is carried out according to the initial screening results given by the detection model, and then initial model training is carried out to achieve automatic labeling of the samples. Low-quality samples are continued to be filtered and corrected according to the confidence results given, and then the next round of model training is started. Through continuous data filtering and model iteration process, the classification accuracy of the model is improved, until the model achieves good performance. Through several groups of binary classification or multi-classification experiments, it is proved that this method can effectively alleviate the bad influence of low-quality data on classification tasks, optimize the model training process and improve classification accuracy."

In this study, we leverage synthetic models generated by VaMos, a vascular modeling tool, to augment the existing TopCoW dataset. By incorporating these anatomically plausible synthetic structures alongside actual MRA data, we improve artery classification using a deep learning model, specifically nnUNet, which is optimized for medical image segmentation. For smaller/thinner and underrepresented arteries, such as the posterior and anterior communicating arteries, the improvement was around 16%. This approach provides a novel solution to data scarcity, showing that synthetic models can effectively complement real data to improve segmentation performance in challenging anatomical regions."

As a result, this can produces floating artifact Gaussians. To address this issue, we propose a method that applies the shader to the output image of the Gaussian renderer. This shader incorporates diffuse and specular reflection models and vignetting. It is optimized with the Gaussian model to ensure that the shader’s output image closely resembles the ground truth input image. Our method was tested on both synthetic and real images, demonstrating its effectiveness."

As such, this fluctuation in the clinical status complicates diagnostic assessment and contributes to the 40% of misdiagnosis. Quantitative measures extracted from electroencephalography (EEG) have been studied to address the issue of misdiagnosis. Single time-point analyses are, however, unable to account for the behavioral variability of the MCS condition and thus, there is the need for the identification of EEG-based features capable of capturing this variability. A cohort of 19 patients diagnosed with MCS and 22 healthy subjects was administered with a monitoring protocol in two consecutive days with the aim of describing the profile of variability over time of spectral EEG oscillations and compare it with the physiological variability. The variability of relative powers in delta, theta, and alpha bands was investigated over two temporal scales: minutes and hours. The entity of the fluctuations in EEG spectral content were compared between the two groups to distinguish between physiological variability and the variability in the EEG content possibly due to behavioral fluctuations inherent to MCS condition. Results indicated that MCS patients showed higher both short- and medium-term fluctuations in alpha relative power with respect to healthy individuals opening the possibility to identify the presence of fluctuations in awareness typical of MCS.Clinical Relevance— This study identified objective EEG-based measures to investigate the presence of short- and medium-term fluctuations in MCS patients to reduce the high rate of clinical misdiagnosis."

    "abstract": "Series arc faults are among the most dangerous faults that can occur in a single-phase electrical circuit because when they occur, the current intensity value will decrease. The protective devices in that circuit must detect the presence of the electric arc as soon as possible and provide consequent disconnection. The devices that do this are called Arc Fault Detection Devices and can identify the electric arc signature that is overlapped on the sinusoidal wave of the power supply voltage at industrial frequency. This study proposes to identify the noise corresponding to the electric arc fault by using an electronic scheme based on a XIAO SAMD21 microcontroller and an AD8361 true power detector circuit. The detection sensitivity can be adjusted by the algorithm implemented in the microcontroller, and the validation of the efficiency of the procedure was done by comparing the disconnection moment of triggering of the proposed scheme and that one of a commercial arc fault detection device. The efficiency of the proposed diagram was demonstrated by recording on a digital oscilloscope the waveforms corresponding to the electrical signals of the series arc fault, its noise and the power supply signal, to highlight the moment of disconnection."

    "abstract": "Falls that occur among elderly adults or individuals with mobility challenges may provide certain health hazards. Due to this, effective fall detection systems need to be designed that are accurate and real-time. The classic methods of fall detection are threshold-based methods and rule-based methods that are less suited to diverse environments and generate too many false alarms. To improve on these disadvantages, this research develops a deep learning-based hybrid model employing CNN and LSTM networks to obtain increased fall detection performance. This model integrates both vision-based data and sensor-based data; it learns on benchmarks. This boosts the detection rate. The experiments prove that the suggested CNN-LSTM model is superior in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's accuracy reaches 96.4 % and also has substantially lower false positive and false negative rates than state-of-the-art ones. The comparison with 3D-CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Hybrid DNN models indicated that our system excels in real-time latency and robustness in various situations. The proposed system can be used for geriatric monitoring, smart health care systems, and autonomous emergency response. However, the study has several drawbacks, such as being computationally expensive and requiring big and diverse datasets to generalize properly. Future studies will work on merging several types of sensors, learning capabilities, and edge-based computers so as to shorten real-time detection. The outcomes of this research can help in the design of AI-based medical instruments that are safer for sensitive parts."

While early detection can significantly improve patient outcome, choices for wide-spread, affordable screening tools are limited. Current clinical standard of lung function assessment relies on in-hospital spirometry, yet portable spirometers can only provide limited knowledge for the localization of respiratory pathological conditions which is crucial for personalized assessments and treatment. Meanwhile, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has gained traction due to its affordability, safety, and portability. However, application in assessing lung function has traditionally been limited by heavy and bulk machinery. In this study, we present a novel system for evaluating lung function using a portable EIT system. Combined with machine learning, the system offers the ability to monitor lung function caused by conditions such as asthma, COPD, and other respiratory disorders. We also leveraged the power of machine learning and EIT to offer a clinically valuable alternative for affordable lung regional-based assessment.

    "abstract": "In the period 2022-2025, the Republic of Moldova has stimulated the development of renewable energy sources quite a lot. The state has made available 3 support schemes for those who wish to develop installations for generating electricity from renewable sources (eRES). Following the stimulation provided by the state through the support schemes, but also the essential increase in electricity tariffs as a result of the energy crisis, consumers have massively developed renewable sources for electricity production (especially photovoltaic and wind installations). In just 3 years, the installed capacity of eRES has exceeded 670 MW, of which 450 MW are photovoltaic (PV) installations. It is worth noting that over 30% of this capacity is for the net metering/net billing support scheme. The massive growth of PV installations began to cause problems during the summer, when the eRES capacity equaled and even exceeded the country's consumption load. The article analyzes the possibility of installing electricity storage batteries for household consumers who have installed PV installations, their optimal sizing depending on the consumption curve profile, the economic advantages. This leads to a decrease in losses in the local network and an increase in the benefits of the owner of the storage installation."

    "abstract": "This paper newly proposes a hybrid control of CLLC resonant converter-based bi-directional low-voltage DC-DC converter (LDC) in electric vehicles (EVs) for regulating the ultra-wide voltage range. The LDC is a key component of power conversion systems in EVs, which transfers energy from the hi-voltage battery (HVB) to the low-voltage battery (LVB). In addition, the LDC is required to perform the ultra-wide voltage range regulation due to the recent transition of EV charging infrastructure. Also, the need for bi-directional operation of LDC has grown to enhance the reliability of EVs. Thus, many studies on LDC have been made to satisfy these requirements. Nevertheless, they still cannot simultaneously achieve the bi-directional operation and ultra-wide voltage range. To address these limitations, the new phase-frequency hybrid controlled CLLC resonant converter is proposed. Its operational principles and design considerations are firstly analyzed. Then, its performance is evaluated by simulation test."

    "abstract": "In recent years, several studies—conducted by both industry and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded initiatives—have proposed linking North America's Eastern and Western Interconnections (EI and WI) through a multiterminal DC (MTDC) macrogrid. These studies have explored the advantages and opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of capacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of small-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation studies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped inter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model of the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of the EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources. Through model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes—for both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and modes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed for the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set points at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is employed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis. The damping performance is evaluated under the designed operating conditions and selected contingency scenarios."

Using more than six years of hourly CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> measurements from the IPR monitoring site, we evaluate three representative forecasting approaches of increasing complexity: Seasonal Naive, SARIMAX, and GRU. The results show that robustness mechanisms, including anomaly substitution, weighted estimation, and robust loss functions, significantly reduce forecast errors for the Seasonal Naive and SARIMAX models. In contrast, the GRU model already delivers highly accurate predictions, and additional robustness adjustments yield only marginal improvements. These findings demonstrate that explicit robustness mechanisms are crucial for simple and statistical forecasting methods. The study highlights the importance of anomaly and change point detection as practical quality control steps for reliable greenhouse gas forecasting."

The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel double-vector model-free predictive current control (DV-MFPCC) for symmetrical six-phase surface vernier permanent magnet motor (SSP-SVPMM). The key is to take advantage of unique feature in surface-mounted PM motor that the natural response components of current gradients caused by different voltage vectors (VVs) are the same and the forced response components are proportional to the amplitude of VVs, thus using only one measured current gradient to achieve current gradients real-time updating caused by all candidate VVs. Furthermore, the duty cycle of non-zero VV is calculated through the q-axis current gradient to reduce the torque and speed ripple, and its validity is verified by comparative simulation results."

The device was set to operate in both monopolar mode (at the maximum power required by the “cut” function) and bipolar mode (at the only available power, for coagulation). To simulate the load as faithfully as possible on which the ESU works, we used a piece of turkey breast meat. To measure the values of the electromagnetic field generated, we used an affordable, mobile solution: the Spectrum Analyzer RSA306B, connected via USB to a laptop on which the Tektronix SignalVu-PCTM software is installed. To measure the values of the electric and magnetic fields, we used two sets of near-field probes, specifically sniffer-type. In this paper, we have reported only the values provided using the 904 probe, electric field sphere type, model 7405ETSLindgren. We made determinations at 32 points located in the nodes of a square grid with a side length of 50 cm, at a height of 125 cm above the floor. The results initially provided by our measurement system in dBm were converted into V/m for comparison with reference levels established by the ICNIRP guidelines.

    "abstract": "A majority of individuals with advanced Parkinson’s disease develop severe gait and balance deficits that significantly restrict mobility, independence, and quality of life. Despite impressive technological advances, gait impairments remain poorly understood and notoriously hard to treat. Most attempts to characterize gait deficits or to identify neural biomarkers of gait dysfunction have been confined to well-controlled, sophisticated laboratory settings. However, such environments fail to capture many critical contextual factors that exacerbate gait deficits in real-world conditions, such as stress, fatigue, or unexpected distractions and environmental constraints. Replicating these unpredictable conditions in laboratory settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we developed a wearable neuromonitoring platform integrating (i) smart, sensorized shoes with embedded microchips running A.I. algorithms for online gait quality assessment, along with (ii) wireless recordings of local field potentials from chronically implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation. This platform enables continuous monitoring of motor and neural biomarkers of gait function and dysfunction across activities of daily life. 13 participants with advanced Parkinson’s disease were monitored during a comprehensive set of out-of-laboratory locomotor tasks, both in the ON and OFF medication conditions. Our platform allowed to assess gait quality, quantify modulations in response to medication, fatigue, and context-specific demands, and to map the underlying neural correlates. This neuromonitoring platform offers valuable possibilities for refining neuromodulation protocols and supporting closed-loop therapies for gait impairments in real-life conditions."

The game’s user navigates a maze environment on a laptop screen using a gaming controller (a joystick). It progresses through easy, medium, and hard routes, and has an error-based spatial learning score. The intervention spanned eight weeks, during which participants played the game for 30 minutes, three times a week. Pre-and post-intervention assessments were conducted using two independent and validated spatial orientation measures: VRNHouse as the primary and the Clock Orientation Test as the secondary outcome.Seven participants (86.3 ± 4.9 years, 2 males) completed the study. Although no statistically significant changes were observed in VRNHouse or Clock Orientation Test scores, 71.4% of participants improved or maintained their performance in the primary outcome measure, while 66.7% demonstrated improvement or stability in the secondary measure. Analysis of spatial learning scores within the Barn Ruins game revealed significant improvements over time (p = 0.0046, Kendall’s W = 0.42), particularly in easy (p = 0.023) and hard (p = 0.01) routes. Performance on medium routes fluctuated, suggesting greater difficulty with these trials.Post-hoc comparisons revealed that by Weeks 7 and 8, participants' overall spatial learning scores were significantly higher compared to those in Week 1. Notably, easy routes exhibited a ceiling effect after Week 4, while harder routes showed consistent improvement after Week 5.Despite modest results in independent outcome measures, the game's significant performance gains suggest its utility in improving spatial skills. Future research with larger samples is needed to validate these findings.Clinical Relevance— These findings highlight the potential of the Barn Ruins game as a novel rehabilitation tool for enhancing spatial learning in older adults with MCI."

    "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely recognized as an indicator of autonomic nervous system activity and stress responses. Photoplethysmography (PPG) provides a non-invasive means of estimating HRV, but traditional peak-detection methods are susceptible to motion artifacts and irregular pulse morphologies, limiting their reliability. This study investigates the Taylor-Fourier (TF) method as an alternative approach, modeling PPG signals as quasi-periodic waveforms with time-varying amplitude and phase. By estimating instantaneous heart rate (IHR) with higher temporal resolution, the TF method provides a continuous representation of heart rate dynamics that may capture additional stress-related variations. The proposed pipeline includes TF-based IHR estimation, HRV feature extraction, and classification using machine learning to compare its performance with conventional IBI-based methods. We apply this approach to the publicly available WESAD dataset, which includes both baseline and stress conditions. While both methods produce comparable time-domain HRV estimates, TF-based frequency-domain metrics exhibit notable differences. To assess its applicability in stress detection, we train machine learning models on HRV features extracted using both methods. Results indicate that TF-derived features can improve classification performance in some models, though subject-specific variability remains a factor. These findings, while still preliminary, suggest that the TF approach could enhance HRV-based stress monitoring, warranting further exploration of its robustness in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Fingertip touch detection, as a crucial method for human-computer interaction behavior analysis, provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding human behaviors and optimizing interface design by analyzing user interaction patterns with devices. However, traditional fingertip touch detection methods often suffer from discrepancies between the actual contact position and the detected position, which limits detection accuracy. This paper proposes an RGB-D-based fingertip touch plane fitting method to eliminate detection deviations and achieve high-precision fingertip touch detection. The study first employs the RANSAC algorithm to perform a plane fitting on a precollected 3D point set of fingertip trajectories adhering to the screen surface, thereby constructing a touch-plane model. During actual detection, the touch state is determined by computing the perpendicular distance between the fingertip coordinates and the fitted plane. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively corrects detection deviations and exhibits strong adaptability and robustness under varying camera angles, providing essential technical support for high-precision fingertip touch detection."

    "abstract": "Although clinicians still regard traditional auscultation as a key bedside assessment tool, interest in its digital counterpart has recently grown. Digitalizing heart sounds enables the extraction without the need of echocardiography of novel clinical indicators like Cardiac Time Intervals (CTIs), temporal parameters reflecting the hemodynamic behavior of the heart. The estimate of the CTIs grounds on the identification of the time of closure of heart valves, which the human ear cannot perceive - but algorithms can. Traditional auscultation areas are still considered a gold standard, but their suitability for CTI estimation was never thoroughly explored. In this study, we analyze the spatial variability of heart sound waveforms over the chest with high spatial resolution. We estimate the time of closure of cardiac valves and define a goal-oriented objective function to automatically identify the best auscultation area for each valve. We compare the selection against visual inspection (manually selecting the signals where discriminating between the left- and right-heart contributions was possible) and against the traditional auscultation areas. We found that the spatial similarity pattern of the sound waveforms recorded using the multi-source sensor is consistent with expectations. The variation in morphology produces a variation in the estimates, whose standard deviation ranges from 7 to 13 milliseconds, potentially causing issues in clinical interpretation. This proves that the selection of the recording point impacts the estimate and must be carefully defined. The estimates resulting from the automatic channel selection present higher correlation coefficients against visual selection (R = 0,73 to 0,96) than against traditional auscultation (R = 0,49 to 0,92). We can conclude that the definition of the best auscultation areas should be considered a goal-dependent task and that the spatial variability of heart sounds plays a role in obtaining robust estimates of clinical biomarkers.Clinical Relevance—The reported spatial variation of the heart sound waveforms makes the definition of the best auscultation areas a goal-dependent task that should be adapted to the clinical task."

To this purpose, high-density EMG signals were recorded from 5 able-bodied participants performing 14 different hand gestures, including 10 fundamental movements and 4 grasps. The recorded EMG signals were offline decomposed with a blind source separation algorithm. Then, motor unit features were computed and a classification paradigm inspired by previous literature was applied. The accuracy of the motor unit based classification was compared to a machine learning approach based on root-mean-square (RMS). Different classification models were tested for both approaches. The accuracy of the motor unit based classification was lower and exhibited a greater inter-subject variability with respect to RMS based classification. However, accuracy values ranged between 80.6% and 90.3% and in some cases were comparable or even higher than those obtained from RMS classification. Our study suggests that motor units have the potential to be used for prosthetic control, though additional research is required to effectively translate these findings into practical applications.Clinical relevance— This study builds on previous literature to demonstrate the feasibility of using motor unit derived features to decode multi-degree-of-freedom hand gestures. The study also highlights technological and methodological limitations hindering real-life application of such approach."

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF detection model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. The proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model’s generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data."

Our approach integrates the UNI foundation model into the HoverNet encoder, combining the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the global contextual modeling of vision transformers. Additionally, we enhance the HoverNet decoder by incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules and utilizing skip connections to effectively fuse multi-scale features. This design improves feature utilization while preserving fine-grained structural details, enabling more accurate and efficient nuclei detection. Experiments on the PanNuke public dataset demonstrate that UNI-Hovernet achieves an average multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.4733, with an average F1-score of approximately 0.53 across five nuclei types. It significantly improves Panoptic Quality (PQ) for inflammatory, connective, and dead nuclei, with increases of approximately 3%, 4%, and 11%, respectively, compared to HoverNet.Clinical relevance— Accurate nuclei segmentation and classification in diverse tissue sections facilitate the analysis of morphometric changes and spatial distribution abnormalities of cell nuclei. These insights can elucidate mechanisms driving tumor inhibition or progression, supporting pathologists in identifying therapeutic strategies or establishing foundations for further research."

Blockchain technology could solve real estate's high-value transactions, complex multi-party processes, fraud, inefficiencies, and lack of trust-the method for secure access, authentication, and estate data encryption with confirmation. Login credentials, biometric authentication, and encryption are used in layered methods. The method begins with a user login via a sign-up page. Standard security procedures are followed when entering username and password. It also supports fingerprint authentication for access control. Biometric data is processed by the Minutiae algorithm for secure and reliable identity verification. Once a user finds an estate, they can submit seller/buyer information and date details. Data is encrypted to prevent tampering. Data is hashed using SHA256 to prevent unauthorized access. This process encrypts documents and real estate information using AES to increase estate confidentiality. Authorized staff must verify these details to ensure the data entered by an individual is authentic and original. Logging into the model with their unique login (supported by Splunk SSO for a single pane of glass) lets them view and validate encrypted estate data. Thus, only trustworthy data is handled and uploaded to the blockchain. The encryption results showed that the records are encrypted securely according to statistical criteria, graphs, correlations, entropy, pixel rate of change index (NPCR), and uniform average intensity of change (UACT).

In response to this demand, shaft generator systems are widely adopted for efficient electric power generation on large commercial vessels.

By integrating an EdgeEnhanced Detail Restoration Network (EEDRN) and an Improved Self-supervised Contrastive Learning module (ISTCL), the method significantly enhances the recognition accuracy of complex contours. The EEDRN module strengthens the restoration capability of local edge details through dynamic residual connections and multi-scale feature fusion, while the IST-CL module optimizes global context modeling using selfsupervised contrastive learning, effectively distinguishing building contours from background interference. Experiments on the WHU dataset and a self-built irregular building dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms mainstream models (such as RefineNet, SegNet, DeepLabV3+, and Transformer-based Swin-Unet) in metrics including Precision (88.1 %), Recall (85.3 %), F1 (86.9 %), and IoU (83.3 %).

This paper combines cryogenic property measurements with finite element analysis (FEA) to compare various winding configurations and materials, identifies loss characteristics at low temperatures, and proposes optimization strategies for cryogenic motor design."

This study examines the integration of weather data and soil moisture to calculate crop requirements for enhanced agricultural water management. Conventional methods may be inaccurate due to variability in local soil and weather conditions. We developed an advanced irrigation control system by employing infused soil and weather data in machine learning. The analysis of weather parameters including precipitation, humidity, temperature, and wind speed, enables real-time updates on soil water content through the calculation of the actual crop evapotranspiration. The calculated evapotranspiration is then used to estimate the soil moisture that is then fed to a fuzzy logic controller for deriving the irrigation rate.

The proposed ROM couples the two subsystems through the exchange of temperature and heat flow rate at the fluid-solid interface (FSI). This approach enables accurate predictions of transient thermal behavior while maintaining computational efficiency, even with varying coolant flow rates. The model is validated against high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models using two test cases. The good agreement with CFD, with less than 5% error in both cases demonstrates the model's capability to be used in battery transient thermal management simulation with varying flow rates."

    "abstract": "Frequency domain analysis reveals fundamental image patterns difficult to observe in raw pixel values, while avoiding redundant information in original image processing. Although recent remote sensing foundation models (FMs) have made progress in leveraging spatial and spectral information, they have limitations in fully utilizing frequency characteristics that capture hidden features. Existing FMs that incorporate frequency properties often struggle to maintain connections with the original image content, creating a semantic gap that affects downstream performance. To address these challenges, we propose the All-in-One Spectral-Spatial-Frequency Awareness Foundation Model (Alliance), a framework that effectively integrates information across all three domains. Alliance introduces several key innovations: (1) a progressive frequency decoding mechanism inspired by human visual cognition that minimizes multi-domain information gaps while preserving connections between general image information and frequency characteristics, progressively reconstructing from low to mid to high frequencies to extract patterns difficult to observe in raw pixel values; (2) a triple-domain fusion attention module that separately processes amplitude, phase, and spectral-spatial relationships for comprehensive feature integration; and (3) frequency embedding with frequency-aware Cls token initialization and frequency-specific mask token initialization that achieves fine-grained modeling of different frequency band information. Additionally, to evaluate FMs generalizability, we construct the Yellow River dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal collection that introduces challenging cross-domain tasks and establishes more rigorous standards for FMs assessment. Extensive experiments across six downstream tasks demonstrate Alliance's superior performance."

    "abstract": "Laser-induced hyperthermia and ablation treatments are promising modalities in oncology, ophthalmology, cardiology, urology, and dermatology, offering minimally invasive alternatives to conventional treatment approaches. Precise spatiotemporal control of laser-induced thermal energy delivery to the target, while minimizing collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissues, is the key to achieving the desired treatment efficacy. However, nonlinear bioheat transfer processes, patient-specific tissue characteristics, diverse treatment objectives, and disturbances present significant challenges in spatiotemporal laser control for achieving precise thermal dose delivery. This article introduces a novel hierarchical laser control architecture comprising two main layers: a multiobjective genetic algorithm to determine the optimal global laser irradiation strategy and a model predictive control to optimize the local thermal dose distribution. The proposed architecture was validated on the phantom and ex vivo porcine tissue. Results demonstrate the uniform and accurate spatial thermal dose delivery across various scenarios, including arbitrary target thermal dose, target treatment temperatures, target area geometries, and heterogeneous and varying biothermal properties. The significance lies in enhancing the precision and efficacy of personalized treatment in real clinical scenarios for robotic-assisted laser-induced thermal therapies, while offering a generalizable control paradigm for diverse thermal therapy modalities employing alternative heat sources."

    "abstract": "Magnetic data inversion is widely used in geological exploration, but complex topography often poses challenges in balancing modeling accuracy and computational efficiency, resolving deep anomalies, and reducing dependence on empirical parameter settings. This paper presents a dimension-consistent random projection inversion method based on a hybrid hexahedral mesh, designed to improve inversion stability and resolution under rugged terrain conditions. The proposed approach adopts a layered meshing strategy: an unstructured hexahedral mesh is applied near the surface to accurately represent topographic variations, while a structured hexahedral mesh is used at depth to enhance forward modeling efficiency. A model weighting matrix is constructed using a dimension-consistent random projection technique to reconstruct the structure of the sensitivity matrix. This effectively alleviates the limitations of conventional depth weighting, such as rapid attenuation and strong reliance on parameter tuning. Numerical experiments verify the method’s accuracy and robustness in recovering the geometry and magnetization of subsurface anomalies. Application to field magnetic data from a geothermal prospect in the Gonghe Basin, Qinghai, demonstrates its effectiveness in delineating reservoir geometry and connectivity. The proposed method offers a practical and adaptable solution for magnetic inversion in geologically complex environments."

However, decision- making issues in the metaverse often involve multiple interests, dynamic environments, and uncertain factors. Especially when faced with multiple selections, decision-makers need to process subjective evaluation information that includes hesitation, fuzziness, temporal dependence, and bi-directional correlation. Then, how to mathematically model the above complex information and achieve effective classification decisions is an interesting and crucial issue. To do this, we first define two new fuzzy sets in the uni-directional and bi-directional hesitant fuzzy environments, namely the uni-directional hesitant fuzzy set and the bi-directional hesitant fuzzy set. Next, a bi-directional hesitant fuzzy-long short-term memory-transformer model is proposed to deal with the defined information and address the above issues. Then, a parallel probability optimization algorithm is designed to derive the optimal results and parallel occurrence probabilities of an alternative. Finally, the proposed methods are verified by a metaverse application example, which provides a new idea for the further development of related technologies."

    "abstract": "The rising incidence of Intensive Care Unit-acquired Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria (ICU-acquired MDRB) presents significant public health challenges. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming, while advanced molecular diagnostics remain expensive and not widely adopted in clinical practice. Although electronic health records (EHR) offer potential for developing effective diagnostic models, extreme data imbalance and complexity inherent in ICU settings limit conventional approaches. We propose an Imbalance-Adaptive Hybrid Encoder-Decoder (IAHED) framework for early ICU-acquired MDRB detection, evaluated on 25,864 ICU stays from the MIMIC-IV database. We analyzed two observation cohorts: 6,358 ICU stays (76 MDRB cases) for 7-day observation and 2,160 ICU stays (63 MDRB cases) for 14-day observation, with class imbalance ratios of 0.012 and 0.029, respectively. Cross-domain validation was conducted using the eICU Collaborative Research Database to evaluate generalizability across different healthcare institutions, with observation cohorts of 2,847 ICU stays (55 MDRB cases) for 7-day observation and 1,280 ICU stays (34 MDRB cases) for 14-day observation. IAHED integrates dynamic and static patient data through a dual-pathway architecture, employing Givens rotations for data augmentation and a composite loss function incorporating contrastive learning to enhance minority class detection. Model interpretability was ensured through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify key clinical predictors and support clinical decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over established machine learning and deep learning methods, achieving AUROC of 0.950-0.963 and AUPRC of 0.857-0.878, with cross-domain validation on eICU demonstrating transferability across both observation windows (AUROC 0.896-0.908), with particularly robust performance in highly imbalanced scenarios. These findings highlight IAHED’s potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and supporting timely clinical decision-making in ICU settings."

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) have significant potential for measuring stress in metallic materials due to their non-contact capability. Traditional stress measurement methods based on acoustoelastic theory require calibration, and their accuracy depends on precisely determining the relationship between acoustic time-of-flight (ToF) and stress. However, this relationship is difficult to establish directly because it is influenced by the specimen’s density, Second-Order Elastic Constants (SOECs), and Third-Order Elastic Constants (TOECs). In practical applications, extensive calibration is necessary to ensure measurement accuracy, and re-calibration is required whenever the specimen’s material changes. To address this limitation, this study proposed a calibration-free uniaxial stress measurement method for metallic materials using orthogonal shear-vertical (SV) EMATs. In this method, two EMATs generate SV waves propagating in perpendicular directions, while two additional EMATs receive these waves. Theoretical analysis demonstrated that uniaxial stress measurements depend solely on the ToF of the two orthogonal SV waves and are independent of factors such as SOECs and TOECs. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were validated through finite element analysis and experimental testing. Experimental results showed that the maximum relative error for calibration-free uniaxial stress measurements of aluminum alloy specimens was 9.29%."

We first establish a modified beam based channel model (BBCM) by performing uniform sampling for directional cosine with deterministic sampling interval, where the beam matrix is constructed using a phase-shifted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Based on the modified BBCM, we propose a beam structured turbo receiver (BSTR) involving low-dimensional beam domain signal detection for grouped user terminals (UTs), which is proved to be asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing mean-squared error (MSE). Moreover, we extend it to windowed BSTR by introducing a windowing approach for interference suppression and complexity reduction, and propose a well-designed energy-focusing window. We also present an efficient implementation of the windowed BSTR by exploiting the structure properties of the beam matrix and the beam domain channel sparsity. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed receivers but with remarkably low complexity."

    "abstract": "Safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) in dynamic multi-agent environments, such as university campuses and industrial parks, necessitates accurate trajectory prediction of interacting agents. Conventional autonomous navigation systems, however, rely heavily on reactive real-time perception and often fail to predict complex spatio-temporal interactions among heterogeneous agents. This limitation frequently leads to suboptimal motion planning outcomes and operational inefficiencies, including deadlock situations, in congested scenarios. This paper introduces Knowledge-Interaction-Temporal Network (KITNet), a novel trajectory prediction framework specifically designed for ADVs operating in such complex, dynamic settings. KITNet employs a hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to model intricate interaction dynamics, incorporating a novel attention mechanism based on set theory for enhanced spatio-temporal feature extraction and prediction of diverse behavior patterns. We evaluate KITNet on several trajectory prediction benchmarks according to the different tailored behavior modes under the defined mode space, including the ETH/UCY pedestrian dataset, the NGSIM highway driving dataset, and the Argoverse 2 urban driving dataset. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, outperforming or matching existing graph-based and recurrent approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of KITNet’s predictive outputs into local motion planning modules, showing potential for significantly reducing conflict scenarios and optimizing trajectory execution for ADVs. These findings establish KITNet as a highly effective trajectory predictor for autonomous transport systems, critically advancing predictive navigation and bridging the gap between perception and robust intelligent decision-making in complex urban and campus environments."

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) is emerging as an efficient contactless power replenishment method for unmanned transport vehicles in intelligent automation, with applications in automated production lines, logistics parks, and port operations. These settings demand high levels of safety and efficiency. For example, AGV charging stations in electromagnetically dense environments must achieve minimal magnetic leakage to avoid interfering with nearby sensors and control systems, while maintaining high transmission efficiency to support rapid charging cycles. Conventional single-layer ferrite shielding often struggles to reconcile the conflicting demands of stringent magnetic leakage suppression and high transmission efficiency. This paper proposes a novel multi-layer passive composite shielding structure based on a functional-grading strategy, where each material is assigned a specific role to optimize performance. This approach achieves omnidirectional leakage suppression while preserving transmission efficiency, delivering an unprecedented balance between electromagnetic compatibility and operational reliability. Theoretical models based on Maxwell’s equations and equivalent circuit theory were established to investigate how shielding parameters affect system performance. Subsequently, structural optimization was guided by finite element simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed structure reduces backside and lateral leakage magnetic flux densities by 58.78% and 31.85%, respectively, while maintaining relatively high transmission efficiency in a 0.3 kW/85 kHz system. Compared to existing passive shielding methods, the comprehensive performance index shows an improvement exceeding 50%, with minimal impact on coil self-inductance and mutual inductance. This work provides a cost-effective and efficient electromagnetic compatibility solution for WPT systems, particularly suitable for industrial applications demanding stringent safety and efficiency standards."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the role of data sharing in enhancing the efficiency of e-government services in Iraq, with a focus on addressing systemic barriers rooted in technical, institutional, and socio-cultural factors. The primary objectives were to assess current data-sharing mechanisms in Iraqi government institutions, identify challenges impeding interoperability, and propose a contextualized framework to bridge policy design and implementation. Using a mixedmethods approach—including policy analysis, technical audits, and stakeholder interviews—the study evaluates Iraq's egovernment ecosystem against global benchmarks and regional models. Key results reveal severe technical fragmentation, with only 30% of systems integrated across ministries, 75% of IT infrastructure outdated, and 85% of data siloed due to incompatible databases. Institutional challenges include a 40% funding deficit for cybersecurity initiatives and fragmented governance, exacerbated by post-conflict political instability. Socio-culturally, bureaucratic resistance (22% willingness to share data) and public distrust (22% trust probability) hinder adoption, driven by historical corruption and cybersecurity vulnerabilities (e.g., 200% rise in phishing attacks). The study contributes a nuanced understanding of Iraq's data-sharing inefficiencies, emphasizing the interplay of legacy systems, policy-implementation gaps, and cultural resistance. It proposes actionable solutions, such as modernized interoperability standards, sustained funding, and trust-building campaigns, to advance Iraq's digital governance agenda. These insights offer valuable lessons for fragile states seeking to balance technical innovation with contextual realities."

    "abstract": "Although current virtual reality(VR) systems offer realistic visual and auditory feedback, but the performance of haptic feedback remains limited. People perceive the physical world through rich haptic properties during interaction with the world, and precision grip is a representative sensorimotor function of human hands. However, tactile perception plays a crucial role in precision grip and object manipulation. To address this gap, we developed a VR-based contour tactile evoking system using a fingertip-wearable haptic device. The system integrates fingertip tracking and provides targeted tactile feedback during object interaction. A mathematical model was established to relate tactile signals to fingertip-object contact features in the virtual space. To evaluate the effectiveness of the haptic feedback, we conducted experiments under visual-only and visuo-haptic conditions. The results showed that haptic feedback reduced the number of object drops and breakages and improved task efficiency, saving an average of 5.65 seconds during grasping. Spectral arc length analysis further indicated smoother thumb and index finger movements in the haptic condition. While statistical significance was not reached, the findings suggest a positive trend and highlight the potential of haptic feedback in enhancing VR interaction performance."

A series-hybrid VFM is investigated in this study and the relation between the MS-dependent performance and the HCF magnet's ID is represented in the form of the HCF magnet's demagnetisation characteristics, re/demagnetisation performance, PM torque capability, reluctance torque capability, and total torque capability. As the HCF magnet is exposed to ID, the re/demagnetisation currents increase, the field regulation range is not greatly affected, the reluctance torque is nearly unaffected, and the PM torque is adversely affected. Full ID of the HCF magnet leads to reducing the hybrid magnet VFM to a “degraded performance single-magnet VFM”. To avoid exposing the newly tested hybrid-magnet VFMs prototypes to ID of their HCF magnets, a test procedure is proposed that can readily identify the demagnetizing current at which ID commences."

    "abstract": "Recent technological advancements facilitate the integration of surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals into control strategies for lower limb prostheses. Particularly, the sEMG signals are used to recognize the motion intent and it is challenging due to the inherent stochastic and nonstationary behavior of the signals. In the present study, a novel approach is proposed for multiclass gait phase classification using a dynamic convolutional neural network (DCNN) of time domain measures of sEMG from hamstrings and quadriceps. For this purpose, sEMG and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data are simultaneously recorded from 20 healthy volunteers walking on a treadmill at a speed of 2.5 kilometres per hour (km/h). The sEMG from four muscles are considered for the analysis namely rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), and semitendinosus (SEM). Three time-domain descriptors namely root mean square, Wilson amplitude and zero-crossing are used to design DCNN for gait phase classification. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively distinguish the four gait phases. All the features are found to have significant difference between the four gait phases. The DCNN achieves a maximum accuracy of 94.00%, average sensitivity of 94.25%, average specificity of 97.75% and Mathews correlation coefffient (MCC) of 92.00%. The findings indicate that the proposed approach effectively decodes the motion intent of lower limb muscles, potentially paving the way for the development of more precise movement control in lower limb prosthetics."

The model is flexible, adaptable to diverse populations, and promotes financial inclusion without compromising compliance requirements. It also offers a foundation for future research on mitigating risks from malicious actors. Furthermore, it is particularly suited for enabling compliant and inclusive decentralized finance (DeFi) applications."

Early detection is important for treatment and management to be effective, however, traditional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and require significant expertise. The research in question studies the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict kidney disease, utilizing publicly available datasets such as the UCI repository. Moreover, various ML algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble techniques, are compared in the study to determine accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, the study uses feature selection techniques to assess the most important biomarkers, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and serum creatinine, which will help in enhancing predictive accuracy. The results of the study reveal that machine learning models are able to achieve high predictive performance, which allows researchers to create clinical decision support systems integrating this technology in the future. This paper presents that it is crucial to employ AI for enhancing the diagnostic efficiency, thus allowing timely interventions, as well as for decreasing the global burden of kidney disease."

The study empirically evaluates learning outcomes, engagement levels, and student satisfaction when using VR-AI simulators compared to traditional laboratory approaches. A post-test-only quantitative experimental design was employed with sixty participants, divided into an experimental group (VR-AI) and a control group (traditional methods). Pre- and post-test answer checklists assessed knowledge enhancement and skill development, while 5-item Likert scale questionnaires evaluated information realism and program appeal. Quantitative results demonstrated significantly better post-test performance in the experimental group (z=-26.604; p<0.001), higher course content engagement (z=-28.517; p<0.001), and greater satisfaction z=-9.162; p<0.001 compared to the control group.

Most existing fusion methods rely on the ideal assumption of spectral consistency between the hyperspectral and multispectral images by omitting the spectral variability with the imaging conditions. To address this issue, a novel fusion method is proposed that explicitly accounts for spectral variation. The hyperspectral and multispectral images are represented via their Block Term Decomposition (BTD), where spectral variability is introduced into the decomposed factors matrices. Additionally, Laplacian regularization is employed to preserve the spatial structure and promote local smoothness in the fused image. This approach enables the model to jointly capture spectral variation and spatial consistency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both spectral fidelity and spatial detail preservation."

Traditional industrial instrumentation is usually used as a measuring tool to monitor the running state of process and key equipment, and the neglect of the ontology failure can easily lead to inaccurate and unreliable data collection, affecting the efficiency of industrial process control, and easy to lead to misjudgment by operators, resulting in safety accidents. This paper analyzes the technical connotation of predictive maintenance for intelligent instrument, and establishes the technical route of mechanism analysis, data acquisition, feature analysis, fault self-test, anomaly detection, fault diagnosis and life prediction. Intelligent instrument is divided into three parts: “transmission”, “sensing” and “communication” from the perspective of complex industrial processes. Three typical application scenarios of intelligent operation and maintenance, security instrument risk management and control, and information security risk management and control are analyzed and the development trend of predictive maintenance technology for smart meters is deduced. The key technologies of predictive maintenance of instrument ontology level and system level are summarized. The research can lay a foundation for the transformation of operation and maintenance of intelligent instrumentation and system from offline to online and from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance."

This paper investigates the frequency response and power-sharing in an inverter-based micro grid through the coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverters operating in parallel. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are conducted on a 12 MV A medium voltage micro grid with two photovoltaic (PV) systems, each having 3 MV A of headroom for regulation, to evaluate the effects of droop coefficients, inertia emulation, and damping on the frequency response and active/reactive power sharing. The study compares different control strategies, including droop and virtual synchronous machine (VSM) based approaches. Results show that the combined inertia emulation from both the GFM and GFL units, with tuned droop and inertia parameters, leads to faster damping of power oscillations and improves the steady-state frequency. In the best-performing case, the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) is reduced to −3.51 Hz/s, and the frequency nadir is improved to 49.92 Hz."

The research introduces a bidirectionally coupled electromagnetic-thermal finite element model implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, incorporating temperature-dependent material properties and a ferromagnetic double-cylinder workpiece that forms a water channel for flow optimization. The 3D model demonstrates accurate prediction of skin depth effects (δ = 0.2 mm in steel at 100 kHz) with boundary layer meshing achieving <1% energy balance error. A computationally efficient 2D axisymmetric model reduces simulation time by 78% while maintaining accuracy within 2.3% of 3D results. Experimental validation confirms temperature predictions within ±1.8°C across the 30 °C to 95°C operating range. Grid Convergence Index analysis validates mesh independence with GCI < 0.8% for critical thermal parameters.

However, the presence of leakage inductance in the transformer winding results in reactive power generation and reduced output voltage. Furthermore, the load dependence of the output voltage limits the operating range of the converter. This paper proposes a new modulation strategy for the DC/DC Active/Passive Current Stiff converter that eliminates load dependencies, maximizes the output voltage gain and minimizes reactive power flow.

This converter is composed of the five-level active-neutral-point-clamped (ANPC) converter leg and the low-frequency unfolding leg. The five-level ANPC converter leg is composed of eight switches, two DC-link capacitors, and one floating capacitor, and it generates a five-level output voltage. By incorporating the unfolding leg, which operates two switches complementarily over half of the fundamental cycle, the proposed converter extends the output to nine voltage levels. The capacitor voltages control is achieved without additional hardware, which simplifies the overall system. The floating capacitor voltage is controlled through redundant switching states, and the two DC-link voltages are controlled according to the direction of the neutral point current. Simulation and experimental results using 1 kW prototype confirm the feasibility and performance of the proposed converter."

    "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems are essential for monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect and prevent unauthorized access, malicious activities, and security breaches in real time. Network intrusion detection systems face persistent challenges in accurately identifying finegrained attack subcategories due to class imbalance, limited feature interactions in tabular data, and variability across different time windows. Models often struggle to capture the hidden patterns required for multi-class classification in imbalanced flow-based datasets. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a deep learning framework that combines Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) with Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs) for fine-grained intrusion classification. The MHSA layers enable the model to learn complex, non-sequential feature dependencies by attending multiple feature interactions simultaneously. The RDBs enhance depth and gradient stability, facilitating effective learning in deep networks, especially under sparse class conditions. A dynamic sampling strategy is incorporated during training, employing SMOTE for oversampling minority classes and random under-sampling of majority classes to ensure balanced learning. The model is trained and evaluated on the large dataset across four temporal resolutions ($5 \\mathrm{~s}, 10 \\mathrm{~s}, 30 \\mathrm{~s}, 60 \\mathrm{~s}$), targeting classification across 13 subcategories. The proposed architecture achieves a peak accuracy of $99.89 \\%$ on the 10 -second window and maintains high recall across rare attack types such as recon-dns and brute force-ftp. This methodology demonstrates a robust and scalable solution for real-time, multi-class intrusion detection, offering improvements in accuracy, fairness, and adaptability over existing baseline models."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of electric power systems driven by integration of renewable resources requires accurate and computationally efficient models for thorough analysis. Detailed Electromagnetic transient (EMT) models are considered to be very accurate and have the ability to capture the fast transients, but are computationally expensive specially when modeling large microgrid system due to the requirement of a high-resolution simulation step size. On the other hand root mean square (RMS) models under the assumption of quasi-steady state require fewer computational resources but cannot capture the electromagnetic transients. Dynamic phasors (DP) modeling technique provides a balance between accuracy and computational burden. The paper presents the DP model of a synchronous generator connected to a local load. This paper discusses the additional considerations required to interface machines modeled in the rotor reference frame with network elements modeled in the natural reference frame. The accuracy and computational benefits of the model are evaluated by comparing it with its EMT counterpart, and results are presented for balanced and unbalanced resistive and inductive loading conditions."

    "abstract": "The design of control algorithm parameters has a significant impact on the reference tracking accuracy and efficiency of power electronic converters. Therefore, it is important to relate the control parameter design to the converter's performance metrics and operating conditions in order to achieve optimized performance. In conventional implementations, these parameters are precomputed and remain nearly constant throughout the converter's operating range. This can lead to sub-optimal performance when the metrics are highly dependent on the converter's loading conditions. Moreover, the relationship between control algorithm parameters, operating conditions, and performance metrics can be complex and difficult to model. In this paper, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is proposed to derive an analytical expression that maps control parameters to converter performance under varying load conditions. The approach is demonstrated through the design of weighting factors in a finite-set model predictive control (FS-MPC) algorithm. Experimental validation confirms that the resulting analytical expression effectively controls the average switching frequency under different loading conditions. The proposed method offers high accuracy with low computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Upper limb function is essential for performing activities of daily living (ADLs). Specifically for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI), impairment of upper limb functions largely affect to reduce their ADLs. Conventional assessments for upper limb functions, for example, Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF), is scored by the total time requirement of various types of upper limb movement and hand manipulation, and additional subjective evaluation would be complemented. While coordination of shoulder and elbow movements is a key function for ADLs in patients with CSCI, this point is totally disregarded as the clinical evaluation. We propose a novel assessment method, Circle Drawing Task (CDT) for the evaluation of shoulder-elbow coordination in individuals with CSCI. In this study, 15 individuals with incomplete CSCI (age: 46.47 ± 10.43) and 12 individuals with complete CSCI (age: 31.00 ± 10.32) were recruited and asked to perform CDT under the quantitative recording of kinematic and electromyographic (EMG). Trunk and upper limb motions were captured using 3D motion analysis (MAC3D, 200 Hz), and muscle activity was recorded using a surface EMG system (Delsys, 1000 Hz). Four key muscles, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and posterior deltoid, were analyzed to observe coordination patterns. Our results indicated that the CDT effectively revealed joint coordination and muscle recruitment patterns, for example, difference between complete and incomplete CSCI and relevance with the level of injury.Clinical Relevance— Our findings suggest that CDT provides additional and quantitative information for the evaluation of upper limb functions which might complement the conventional clinical assessment. Since shoulder-elbow coordination is a key function for individuals with CSCI, our proposed method might be useful not only as an evaluation method, but also as information for the prescription of the rehabilitation interventions."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition is a cornerstone of affective computing and human-computer interaction. However, progress in this field remains limited by the inherent fuzziness of emotions and the high complexity of EEG signals. To address these challenges, we propose Orthogonal Fuzzy Power-Coherence Alignment (OFPCA), a novel framework designed to enhance emotional brain representation learning. To effectively model the fuzzy nature of emotions, OFPCA employs a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system as a feature learner. To overcome the complexity of EEG signals, it aligns two complementary perspectives-the local-energy view and the cross-regional interaction view-through contrastive learning, enabling a more comprehensive EEG representation. The local-energy view is represented by power spectral density (PSD), while the cross-regional interaction view is captured by coherence (COH). To ensure robust emotional brain representation learning, we introduce orthogonal regularization loss into OFPCA’s training process. We evaluate OFPCA on two benchmark datasets (SEED with three emotions and CRED with five emotions) under two evaluation settings. Under the cross-subject setting, OFPCA achieves 41.14% on CRED and 83.24% on SEED. Under the intra-subject setting, it reaches 63.24% on CRED and 85.37% on SEED. These results surpass existing methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of OFPCA. This study demonstrates that leveraging the inherent fuzziness of emotions enhances emotion recognition and introduces OFPCA as a novel fuzzy learning-based framework for multi-view EEG learning."

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is closely linked to abnormalities in the atrial substrate, including structrural and electrical remodeling. P-wave indices have been proposed for the early identification of patients prone to AF, with the beat-to-beat variability of the P-wave morphology in long vectorcardiographic (VCG) recordings revealing that AF patients present a more variable P-wave morphology compared with healthy subjects. In the current work, we use unsupervised learning techniques to categorize AF patients based on this temporal variability of the P-waves. Subsequently, supervised machine learning techniques are used for the classification of the patients using P-wave characteristics extracted from a standard 12-lead ECG. Thirty AF patients were included, for whom both VCG and 12-lead ECG recordings were acquired. k-means clustering, based on the silhouette value, revealed the existence of two main categories of patients using the P-wave temporal variability from the X lead of the VCG. P-wave characteristics on a beat-to-beat basis were calculated for all the leads of the 12-lead ECG and the standard deviation for each patient was calculated in order to quantify the spatial variability of the P-waves. Statistically insignificant features were excluded, and the Boruta feature selection algorithm, together with a voting method, identified the most important features, which were ultimately used for training two models: a Support Vector Machine and a Random Forest. A class balancing technique was also applied. Due to the small dataset, the entire process was repeated 100 times, revealing that the RF model achieved an accuracy of 80.2%, suggesting that the temporal variation of the P-wave can be predicted from the analysis of its spatial characteristics in a short recording. A larger dataset is required to improve the trustworthiness and reproducibility of the model.Clinical Relevance— This work can be used for the stratification of AF patients during sinus rhythm using a standard 12-lead ECG, reducing time and cost, and leading to a better allocation of resources"

    "abstract": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE) represents a minimally invasive and non-thermal method for tumor ablation, which induces cell death through short high-voltage pulses applied via two needle electrodes inserted directly into the tumor tissue. The main advantage of this approach lies in its non-thermal nature, which preserves the structure of the surrounding tissue and facilitates post-treatment recovery. However, it is critically important to closely monitor the temperature increase that can occur due to heat dissipation from the Joule effect, which can be potentially harmful. To this end, in this study, we conducted experimental tests on well-established plant-based models (potatoes) and animal samples (ex vivo porcine liver), using two sets of parameters: setup 1 (electrical potential of 1500 V, 70 pulses of 90 µs) and setup 2 (electrical potential equal to 3000 V, 100 pulses of 100 µs). We evaluated the temperature change and the treatment area. The electric field was applied with two electrodes, and the temperature variation was measured with two arrays of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, each embedding 40 sensors. Results revealed that treatment with setup 1 produced, at the middle between the electrodes (1 cm from each electrode), a maximum temperature increase of <3 °C. In contrast, setup 2 resulted in a maximum temperature change of >10 °C at a line equidistant from the electrodes and 3 °C at lateral positions 1 cm from one of the electrodes. The use of FBG sensors, for the first time in this application, provided high accuracy (0.1 °C) and good spatial resolution (1.2 mm), enabling real-time, multipoint monitoring of the temperature variation during the IRE procedure.Clinical Relevance—These findings highlight the importance of accurate thermal monitoring and real-time temperature feedback toward enhancing the safety and efficacy of IRE therapy."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is a powerful tool for visualizing the vocal tract and tongue motion during speech articulation. A key aspect of analyzing tongue motion is accurately tracing the palate's contour in US images, as it provides a fixed anatomical reference for measuring tongue position and deformation. However, accurately tracing the palate in US images remains challenging due to limited visibility caused by the air gap between the palate and the tongue. To address this limitation, we evaluate the reproducibility of manual palate tracing using methods that rely on varying levels of assistance from image-enhancement algorithms. One of these methods is the cumulative echo skeleton (CES), which enhances video frames to stack and reconstruct palate echoes. These methods are tested across different swallowing tasks. Results indicate that CES-based methods enhance rater agreement, primarily due to the cumulation of echoes. Among the tasks, dry swallow consistently yields higher agreement across methods. Additionally, the CES-based automatic method was benchmarked against manual annotations, showing promising accuracy in dry swallow with a mean sum of distances of 2.63 mm. These findings emphasize the important role of method and task selection in enhancing reproducibility and highlight the potential of automated approaches for palate tracing in US imaging.Clinical relevance— In Speech-Language Pathology (SLP), the application of real-time US imaging can be used in diagnostics and treatment of Speech Sound Disorders (SSD). Furthermore, it facilitates observations of oral movements like swallowing and mastication. The incorporation of a static image of the palate—an anatomical structure that is both familiar and tangible within the oral cavity—provides a valuable reference point for interpreting the dynamic movements of the tongue. This visual aid enhances the understanding of real-time ultrasound images, benefiting both the clinician and the client."

To do that, we conducted a review of the computational cost of various denoising techniques and analyzed the necessity of their use and the feasibility of their implementation in wearable systems. A database of physiological signals during various exercises has been collected to assess the impact of movement on signal quality. We found that not all signals require denoising, as skin temperature measurements are largely immune to artifacts, while EEG and ECG signals are significantly affected by movement. Among the activities tested, jumping caused the most contamination. A test is run to determine the power consumption for different complexity levels of the denoising technique and sampling rates. The aim is to identify efficient denoising methods suitable for implementation on low-power wearable devices used in monitoring physical activity."

    "abstract": "Valvular heart disease (VHD) is defined as a cardiovascular disease that affects any heart valve and is becoming a major concern for public health due to the growing prevalence, impact on patient quality of life and healthcare costs. In this study, we carried out the classification of valvular heart diseases based on heart rate variability (HRV) indices and Hjorth parameters in electrocardiograms (ECG), seismocardiography (SCG), and gyrocardiogram (GCG) with the Classification Learner App in MATLAB R2024a. The study was carried out on 30 concurrent ECG, SCG, and GCG signals with annotated heartbeats taken from a publicly available dataset. The most frequently used classifier was Efficient Logistic Regression (binary linear classifier). The highest classification accuracy was observed for the detection of mitral regurgitation (86.7% for all signals), followed by mitral stenosis (83.3%-86.7%) and tricupsid regurgitation (70.0%-76.7%). The most relevant features for mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis were based on frequency domain and ellipse area, except for SCG, and for tricupsid regurgitation were based on time domain for SCG and GCG."

    "abstract": "We test the hypothesis that amplitude permutation conditional entropy (APCE) is more powerful than permutation conditional entropy (PCE) when complexity of heart period (HP) dynamics is decreased by vagal blockade or withdrawal. We acquired HP variability in 9 healthy male physicians (age: 25-46 yrs) at baseline (B) and during administration of a high dose of atropine (AT) and in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers (age: 24-54 yrs, 9 males and 6 females) at rest in horizontal position (T0) and during 90° head-up tilt (T90). In addition to coarse-graining-free methods, like PCE and APCE, we computed coarse-graining-based k-nearest-neighbor conditional entropy (KNNCE) for comparison. Markers were computed over 256 consecutive HP values, thus targeting the complexity of short-term cardiac control. PCE was unable to detect the decrease of HP variability complexity during AT compared to B, while APCE and KNNCE could. All the conditional entropy markers found a decrease in HP variability complexity during T90 compared to T0. Only APCE was correlated with KNNCE in both protocols. We conclude that APCE is more reliable than PCE in assessing cardiac control complexity, likely due to the better ability of APCE in the presence of the low signal-to-noise ratio of HP dynamics observed during AT."

    "abstract": "Airborne structural health monitoring system is an important means of safety monitoring of aircraft airborne structures, and the safety of airborne structural health monitoring system itself is becoming more and more important with the continuous development of the application of Prognostics and Health Management technology in civil aircraft. Traditional safety analysis methods, such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), are mainly based on the linear perspective of the accident chain, which makes it difficult to accurately analyze the nonlinear problems such as system component interactions and human-machine interactions. Therefore, this paper proposes a safety analysis method based on STAMP-SOTIF, which combines the system hierarchy idea of System-Theoretical Accident Model and Process (STAMP) and the functional safety analysis of Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), to identify the system’s safety hazards from multiple perspectives and levels, formulate comprehensive safety constraints, and continuously improve the safety design through closed-loop evaluation and optimization. The method has been successfully applied to an airborne structural health monitoring system project, which improves the safety of the system by comprehensively identifying potential safety hazards and proves its effectiveness and application value in engineering practice."

    "abstract": "Renewable Energy Sources (RES) are a prominent solution to meet the increasing power demand in modern power systems. However, their intermittent nature poses significant challenges in ensuring stable and reliable power delivery. One of the key challenges is effectively managing energy between RES and energy storage devices under various operating conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive power-sharing strategy within an energy management scheme (EMS) for a grid-connected Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) with RES. The proposed adaptive power-sharing coefficient dynamically allocates power between the grid and the battery based on the battery's state of charge (SOC). Additionally, the EMS ensures rapid DC link voltage restoration in response to generation and load variations, minimizes battery charge/discharge stress during both steady-state and transient conditions, and enables smooth mode transitions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated through comprehensive simulation and experimental studies."

    "abstract": "Precise control of drilling depth and speed in complex bone tissues is critical for the safety and efficiency of orthopaedic robotic surgery. Fixed-gain PID controllers often exhibit response lag, overshoot, or oscillation when facing drastic changes in bone properties. This paper proposes a multi-stage fuzzy PID control strategy utilizing real-time depth information. Inputs include drilling depth error (e), its rate of change (de), and identified bone layer type (FREE, CANCELLOUS, CORTICAL). Dedicated fuzzy rule subsets are designed for each bone layer to dynamically adjust PID parameters and drilling feed-rate (v). A multi-rule-group architecture enables adaptive and smooth control transitions across different tissue layers. Safety rules, including emergency braking and smooth shutdown near breakthrough, are incorporated to enhance robustness. Simulation and physical experiments validate the approach. Results demonstrate smooth deceleration near the breakthrough point, precise stopping with 0.4 mm error, and a 10.1 % reduction in execution time compared to traditional PID control. The proposed method significantly enhances the safety, reliability, and efficiency of robotic bone drilling."

Taking multi-pin integrated circuits as the research object, the combination optimization method based on pseudo-random number sampling and twopin testing is studied and verified by experiments. The correctness of the proposed method is proved by comparing whether the ESD failure threshold voltage of the optimization method and the traditional method is close, and the test time comparison proves that the proposed method can further reduce the test time."

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of smartphones and handheld devices, Android malware stands as a substantial security concern. Employing static analysis for mobile malware presents a proactive approach to understanding and unveiling potential threats within Android applications without the need for execution. Most of the existing studies on static analysis rely on machine learning. However, the black-box nature of machine learning models and their lack of explainability often hinder trust, transparency, and the ability to understand or justify their predictions. Counterfactual explanations enable security analysts to grasp the reasoning behind the decisions of black-box machine learning models (the “why?”) and also offer a way to pinpoint specific data instances whose alteration would lead to different prediction results (the “why not?”). In this paper, we investigate the use of the counterfactual explanation method to explain the predictions made by a machine learning model for Android malware classification. We assessed the quality of counterfactual explanations using a stability metric as well as investigating their feasibility by defining feature-based constraints."

    "abstract": "Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) enable users to control external devices by interpreting sensorimotor activity recorded via ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG). Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS) has recently emerged as a promising alternative motor task for BCI applications. However, intra- and inter-subject EEG variability remains a major challenge, affecting BCI system reliability. While variability is a well-known issue, its precise sources and impact on different EEG patterns remain unclear, with a lack of formal and quantitative studies of BCI variability. Thus, this study quantifies intra- and inter-subject variability in MNS-induced sensorimotor desynchronization (ERD) and compares it with that of MI. Results show that MI elicits stronger ERD with lower intra-subject variability, suggesting more consistent activation patterns, while inter-subject variability is similar between tasks. Additionally, the variability of classification accuracies based on Riemannian geometry exhibits a similar trend. These findings provide insights into EEG variability and its implications for BCI design. Identifying stable neural patterns could improve MI- and MNS-based BCIs, particularly for applications such as intraoperative awareness monitoring."

    "abstract": "Cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a transformative technology that enables continuous noninvasive measurement of BP, which is critical for early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, current predictive models exhibit performance limitations across underrepresented demographics. This limitation is particularly pronounced in hypertensive populations, where the large BP volatility challenges accuracy of the model for BP estimation. Addressing these demographic disparities is crucial to ensure the objectivity and fairness of model for cuffless BP estimation. This paper proposes a self-organizing mixture of experts (SO-MoE) framework for BP estimation, which implements automated expert allocation mechanisms based on patient-specific characteristics. This specialized design enables precise expert selection for individualized BP estimation. We evaluated this system on the CAS-BP dataset of over seven hundred subjects and compared it with several deep learning models. The proposed system demonstrated promising performance for BP estimation with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 5.59 mmHg and 4.07 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) respectively. Besides, the SO-MoE yielded estimation errors of -0.24 ± 7.85 mmHg for SBP and 0.33 ± 5.49 mmHg for DBP in the overall population. Key innovations of the proposed framework include reduced computational overhead, sustained temporal stability, and consistent performance across diverse demographic groups. These results establish a foundation for equitable and clinically accurate BP estimation, addressing the representation challenges inherent in cuffless BP monitoring."

The system provides real-time information, including jeepney route codes, route coverage, location, availability, speed, distance to commuters, designated loading and unloading areas, estimated commute durations, and suggestions for optimal travel options. The solution utilizes LoRa technology with the LoRaWAN protocol to transmit GPS data from jeepneys to a Firebase cloud server, ensuring efficient data handling. Google APIs enable real-time mapping and enhance application functionality, offering users an intuitive and reliable transport assistant. Implemented in Cebu, Philippines, the system demonstrated significant improvements in operational efficiency, reducing commuter waiting times and optimizing travel options. Despite challenges such as physical obstructions and limited gateway coverage, the deployment successfully included at least 50% of jeepney routes.

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is leading to a significant increase in the demand for EV charger power capacity and new power flow dynamics. Additionally, despite advancements in fast charging technology, charging times remain relatively long. Therefore, it is crucial to develop highly flexible and scalable fast chargers that can not only adapt to the evolving power needs of EVs but also decrease charging times. In light of these facts, this paper proposes a new boost charging mechanism for an extremely fast charger, which is powered by a high-power medium voltage DC (MVDC) bus. In the proposed fast charging system, two types of input-series output-parallel dual active bridge converters (ISOP DABC) are defined: bus-forming and boost charging converter sets. The bus-forming sets generate multiple low voltage DC (LVDC) buses at different voltage levels, while booster sets aim not only to maximize EVs charging speed (injecting extra-power into the LVDC buses) but also to support overloaded or under-maintenance bus-forming converters. This can greatly enhance the overall flexibility and resilience of the fast charger. Simulation results show the merits of the proposed boost charging mechanism."

The mechanical shift angle between radial and axial rotor modules is adjusted to align the peak points of the magnet and reluctance torque components. The stator utilizes a Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) core with toroidally wound coils to enable its 3D flux path. The active parts of the machine are optimized using multi objective genetic algorithm technique. The paper also analyzes demagnetization effects on the Ferrite magnets and proposes a method for demagnetization reduction. The proposed design is then compared with a commercial V-shaped permanent magnet synchronous motor with rare-earth magnets and the results show improved volumetric torque density, a higher power factor, and lower torque ripple with no utilization of rare-earth elements."

    "abstract": "Electric power grid is experiencing a growing number of distributed and inertia-free generation resources. To facilitate the growing generation and load demands, and ensure stable operation, energy storage systems, especially behind-the-meter-storage (BTMS), have emerged as a potential candidate. BTMS plays a vital role in grid storage and supports high-power charging for EVs and datacenters, among other applications. However, the potential for thermal runaway and associated safety concerns in the batteries can hamper their widespread adoption. In this work, we provide a solution for the fast and controllable discharge of a cell that is identified as faulty in the battery pack. We do this by incorporating fast circuit breaking using a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) which provides active control over the cell connection as opposed to conventional passive solutions. Testing on the simulation platform successfully validated the concept. Controlled discharge testing with 20Ah lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells between 1C to 10C discharge rates on the hardware prototype supported simulation results. It demonstrated design feasibility and provided essential data for its performance and thermal characteristics, while also revealing limitations that inform areas for further optimization."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Most segmentation models are developed through supervised learning, which requires access to large amounts of annotated data. However, acquiring such datasets is often expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches alleviate this challenge by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. While SSL methods have achieved promising results, they still have some limitations. Predictions made by these methods disregard the model uncertainty, leading to unreliable predictions. The predictions made by these models are often affected by the noise introduced during the SSL process. Additionally, these models fail to adapt well to complex medical images and are unable to scale well in out-of-domain samples. To address these limitations, we propose UA-UNet, an uncertainty-guided teacher-student model architecture built on top of the Residual U-Net for multi-class medical image segmentation. The model incorporates uncertainty estimation, which guides the generation of high-quality pseudo-labels from an ensemble of teacher models. By combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling, our method effectively reduces the influence of high-uncertainty regions while enhancing segmentation accuracy. We compared the model with 10 other methods on the 2023 Kidney Tumor Segmentation Challenge dataset (KiTS23). The proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art models with a Dice score of 0.901 and IoU of 0.891. The proposed model also provides uncertainty maps, which could enhance the interpretability of the segmentation result. These features make UA-UNet a robust method for semi-supervised segmentation in medical imaging, particularly when labeled data is scarce."

    "abstract": "The agricultural demand for certain crops has increased over the years, raising issues over the global food supply, thus the need for increased sustainability and security in food production. Managing and monitoring the production of vital crops by crop health monitoring (CHM) is tedious, expensive, time-consuming, and requires abundant resources. Image-based classifiers for sugarcane leaf disease (SLD) have been developed, most notably using convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNNs are effective machine learning algorithms but require more computational resources to train and are best suited for smaller datasets. On the other hand, Vision Transformer (ViT) networks require fewer computational resources; they perform similarly to CNNs on smaller datasets and perform significantly better on larger datasets. With this, the study developed a comparative analysis between various CNN and ViT architectures for SLD classification from an SLD dataset in Mendeley. Eight CNNs and ViTs were trained and evaluated: DenseNet, ResNet, VGG, MNASNet, SimpleViT, RegionViT, CrossFormer, and LeViT. The ResNet model developed outperformed the other models and achieved an accuracy of 98.42%. The DenseNet model developed required significantly less computational costs than the ResNet model and achieved an accuracy of 97.83%, making both models suitable and recommended for monitoring and classifying sugarcane and other crops. The ViTs showed promising results, with simpler architectures such as SimpleViT achieving higher accuracies than that of more complex ViTs such as CrossFormer. The findings of this study contribute to making CHM easier and more widespread and provide insights on whether to use CNNs or ViTs for classifiers in sustainable agriculture."

These mechanisms integrate energy-saving approaches through dynamic allocation of resources and live migration of virtual machines running on physical hosts. The paper discusses the development and implementation of techniques to optimize placement and migration of VMs in an effort to save energy, reduce server load, and make the most of resources. The paper proposes an algorithm that continuously changes the placement of VMs based on real-time server load and energy consumption. The algorithm is to execute live migration commands in the underlying hypervisor - XenServer in our case - to enable VMs to shift among physical servers freely so as to equal resource utilization. This work has the added advantage of a centralized management tool, XenCenter, which can make migration decisions automatically based on predefined policies, to enhance overall energy efficiency with respect to the data center. Results from experiments carried out indicate that our approach can greatly reduce power consumption with added advantages when it comes to performance under workloads that keep changing."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current dynamics in modern power systems, posing new challenges for conventional transmission line protection schemes. One critical factor influencing these dynamics is the use of fault current limiters within IBR control strategies. Among them, dynamic saturation-based and magnitude-based current limiters are the most prevalent, each modifying the fault current behavior in terms of magnitude, sequence components, and phase angle relationships. These alterations can significantly affect the sensitivity, directionality, and reach accuracy of traditional protection elements. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of two distinct implementations, dynamic saturation-based and magnitude-based current limiters, and evaluates their impacts on directional and distance protection performance. By quantifying changes in symmetrical components and phase angle deviations under fault conditions, the study offers practical insights into the protection coordination and reliability implications in IBR-dominated transmission networks. The findings aim to support the development of more robust and adaptive protection strategies for evolving grid architectures."

    "abstract": "Energy storage systems (ESSs) are critical assets in the grid to maintain and enhance the stability, efficiency, and reliability of modern electric grids. Through pragmatic and novel control design, ESSs have the potential and flexibility to deliver a variety of grid-enhancing functions. The effectiveness and quality of these control strategies must be thoroughly tested and validated before they can be deployed in actual systems. However, testing these control algorithms directly on real systems is expensive and potentially unsafe. This paper presents the development of a comprehensive controller-hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) platform to facilitate the design, testing, and validation of novel energy storage control techniques under near-realistic conditions. The platform integrates high-fidelity models of the electric grid with external physical controllers. Additionally, the platform also incorporates the effects of the battery management system (BMS) and some aspect of power management systems within the framework, allowing us to capture interactions of control strategies with BMS, aspects that are often neglected in existing studies. The platform allows for rigorous testing of control algorithms taking into consideration aspects of computational and communication delays and robustness against modeling uncertainties. This paper specifically focuses on the design and testing of an ESS-based fast frequency support control strategy for microgrids. By simulating the plant (grid) in real-time using high-fidelity models and integrating the controller on real hardware, this setup provides valuable insights into the performance of the ESS."

To ensure accurate measurement, the identification and accurate delineation of the crypts boundaries is paramount for the extraction of morphometrics features that then need to be linked to clinical assessment. Endocytoscopy enables the virtual histology and real time assessment of mucosa with its high magnification capability to visualize the crypts and other microstructure. We used a Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), to localize and segment crypts, to extract the quantitative morphometric index which may potentially be useful to characterize patients with healthy and inflamed mucosa in Ulcerative Colitis (UC). A total of 65 endocytoscopy videos from 47 patients are processed for segmentation followed by quantitative measurements of the crypts. For the Mask R-CNN segmentation process, on test data of four patients, no false positive is detected, and sensitivity observed is 94% with overall accuracy of 96%.Then, from all frames with crypts segmentation, we extract parameters such as crypt density, area, eccentricity, diameter, average distance of the crypt from the neighboring crypts. We observed that the automatic measurements have a 95% correlation with those extracted from the manually annotated crypts.Clinical Relevance— Quantitative measurements of intestinal crypts are important for understanding gut health, disease pathogenesis, and the response to therapies. Example: In colorectal cancer, abnormal crypt growth is a key early feature hence this approach can aid in detecting early-stage cancer."

    "abstract": "Tracking cortical neurons over several days can provide extensive data for their electrophysiology features, development trajectories, and connectivity with other neurons within neuronal circuits. However, reliably identifying the same neurons over time remains a challenge for high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) recordings. In this study, we developed a weighted graph-based tracking algorithm to classify trackable units and monitor their features over time. We applied this algorithm to 160 recordings of neural activity collected from a mouse cortical organoid every hour for seven days on an HD-MEA. Recordings were pre-processed to extract spiking waveforms, spike trains, and spatial locations. Waveforms were clustered for putative cell types. Our approach identified 46 trackable units, representing 53.5% of all recorded neural activity samples. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that trackable units had a higher tendency to connect with untrackable ones. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a weighted graph-based method for tracking individual neurons over extended periods and provides insights into neuronal development and network dynamics in cortical organoids."

There is limited literature on modeling and predicting housing preference based on sex assigned by birth. Real estate stakeholders plan better sustainable development and marketing strategies to meet the distinct needs of different gender groups when green facade technology is accounted for. This paper combines Generative AI, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Kmeans clustering, and classification models. Silhouette analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering. The average silhouette scores indicated that the clustering was adequate, with scores around 0.81 for k = 2, suggesting that the features effectively segment gender preferences. Both genders share preferences for self-climbing and hanging plants, indicating homogeneity in these features, while certain green facade features are highly effective predictors of gender-based segmentation. The experimental result agrees that linear efficient SVM is the most appropriate model for gender segmentation modeling in residential buildings, particularly in the context of green facade preferences."

To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy."

Sixty-four athletes were evaluated using countermovement jump (CMJ), drop jump (DJ), and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) tests for shoulder internal and external rotation. Performance metrics were analyzed via three-way MANOVAs. Results revealed significant effects of session, category, and level on jump performance, with U18 and regional-level players consistently outperforming their peers. All groups improved from pre- to mid-season, reflecting training adaptations and natural growth. However, the interaction effect was not significant, suggesting that all groups improved similarly regardless of category or level of competition. Shoulder strength assessments showed improvements throughout the season, but no consistent differences were observed based on level. The findings suggest that while older and higher-level athletes demonstrate superior baseline performance, seasonal improvements are relatively uniform, likely influenced by maturation processes. This study highlights the value of jump and strength analyses in youth volleyball over a season, providing practical guidance for coaches to tailor training programs and track physical development in adolescent athletes. In addition, the inclusion of percentile values represents a valuable resource for coaches, offering benchmarks to estimate expected performance by category and to better interpret individual improvement across the season."

Both types of indicators were highly effective, with the feature-based sleep spike-wave index achieving the best univariate performance (AUC-ROC: 94.78%). Connectivity features showed significant discriminatory power, with the characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, and strength achieving AUC-ROC values exceeding 90% in awake EEG. Combining feature-based and connectivity indicators in multivariate models further improved classification, reaching a top AUC-ROC of 96.59%. These findings show the potential of brain connectivity as a biomarker for EE-SWAS, complementing traditional EEG approaches and enhancing diagnostic capabilities by being quick, objective, and automated. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights into the connectivity mechanisms underlying neurocognitive regression in SeLECTS, which appears to emerge from an \"over-connectivity\" hampering normal functioning.Clinical Relevance— This work proposes fully automated indicators for diagnosing the EE-SWAS."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography is a widely used technique for assessing muscle morphology by tracking fascicle length and pennation angle during contraction. In the last two decades, numerous automatic methods for fascicle tracking have been developed, but the majority of them were designed for static or well-controlled dynamic contractions, with limited applicability to unconstrained tasks, such as locomotion. The automatic fascicle tracking during these movements poses significant challenges, as out-of-plane movements of the fascicles can compromise their visibility in the bidimensional ultrasound image. In this study, we propose a semi-automatic tracking algorithm specifically designed to track fascicles during unconstrained cyclic movements. The approach integrates a frequency processing pipeline to enhance the visibility of the structures of interest and a supervision module specifically introduced to reduce tracking inaccuracies. We applied this method to ultrasound videos of the medial gastrocnemius in four subjects during walking. We then analyzed potential associations between gait phases and tracking errors relative to manual tracking. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the introduced tracking approach and a tendency of greater error occurrence during the stance-swing transition resulting from a diminished fascicle visibility."

Scoring RWA relies heavily on visual inspection of electromyography (EMG) signals from polysomnography (PSG) recordings. This process is time-consuming and prone to inter-rater variability, particularly due to the presence of artefacts. Currently, no standardized method for artefacts removal is available. This study proposes a Matched-Wavelet approach to characterize the morphology of EMG signals, and a Machine Learning (ML) based framework to identify artefacts from EMG recordings during REM sleep, to facilitate subsequent RWA scoring, by decreasing manual labour. The best models achieved F1 scores of 79.2% and 86.3% in detecting artefacts from background and phasic activity, respectively. These results suggest the feasibility of automatically remove artefacts through a low-computational cost method, leading to improved reliability in RWA assessments.Clinical relevance— The framework provides a robust tool for the assessment of artefacts in EMG recordings, improving the reliability of RWA assessment, and contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy"

    "abstract": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most powerful techniques for diagnosing various failures and degradation in electrochemical devices. To date, online converter-based EIS has been demonstrated on only one port at a time—either the input or the output—using tailored control loops to preserve linearity, stability, and causality for that specific device under test. This work presents a single-perturbation scheme that excites one converter to perform simultaneous EIS (S-EIS) on both its input and output ports, enabling characterization of two distinct electrochemical devices in a hybrid system within a single acquisition. Implementing this approach will expand the online application of EIS and optimize the time it takes to perform a comprehensive system measurement. Simulations confirmed by hardware data verify the feasibility of the proposed S-EIS method. The calculated equivalent-circuit parameters deviate by less than 15% of their reference values, demonstrating encouraging performance even at this preliminary conceptual phase."

Existing torso stabilisers are often rigid and restrictive. We present an early investigation into a non-restrictive 1 degree-of-freedom (DoF) mechanical torso stabiliser inspired by devices such as centrifugal clutches and seat-belt mechanisms. First, the paper presents a motion-capture (MoCap) and OpenSim-Based kinematic analysis of the cable-based system to understand the requisite device characteristics. The evaluation in simulation resulted in the cable-based device to require 55-60 cm of unrestricted travel, and to lock at a threshold cable velocity of 80-100 cm/s. Next, the developed 1-DoF device is introduced. The proposed mechanical device is transparent during activities of daily living, and transitions to compliant blocking when incipient fall is detected. Prototype behaviour was then validated using a MoCap-Based kinematic analysis to verify non-restrictive movement, reliable transition to blocking, and compliance of the blocking.Clinical relevance— This work establishes the need for torso stabilisation in individuals with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and proposes a low-cost passive platform to achieve the same."

The apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), the gold standard for OSA diagnosis, has been shown to be inadequate for predicting CVD outcomes, and studies have explored oximetry-derived parameters as potential predictors. While many studies have proposed individual oximetry-derived parameters as promising predictors, the combined predictive performance has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the combined predictive performance of demographic information, lifestyle habits, and oximetry-derived features for 3-year CVD mortality. The results demonstrate that oximetry-derived parameters alone are insufficient for prediction (F1 scores: 58.1% and 53.65% in the training and testing datasets, respectively), but perform well when combined with demographic and lifestyle features (F1 scores (p-values <0.05): 79% and 77.47% in the training and testing datasets, respectively). These findings highlight the need to incorporate additional covariates in future studies and suggest the possibility developing a model to predict future CVD events or clinical use."

It offers improved output waveform quality and reduced electromagnetic interference. However, the large number of power switches in CHBMC increases the probability of open-circuit (OC) switch faults, which can lead to issues such as overshoot currents, increased current harmonics, and degraded performance. To address this problem, this paper leverages the space vector modulation (SVM) concept to design diagnostic counters capable of identifying multiple OC switch faults. By utilizing the zero voltage level periods in each power cell, the counters can detect abnormalities and accurately identify the faulty switches. The proposed method is independent of the number of voltage levels, making it widely applicable. Experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the approach."

A total of 125 individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from a local clinic and categorized into groups based on cognitive diagnosis: Mild Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD).This study focused on distinguishing individuals requiring treatment (AD and MCI) from those without cognitive impairment (SCD) using gait-related data collected from daily life. This classification task was particularly challenging, as the SCD group shares cognitive symptoms with MCI and the data was collected in non-controlled, real-world conditions.Participants used smartphones and smartwatches for one month to collect accelerometer and gyroscope data during daily activities. We preprocessed walking segments and trained a deep learning classifier to differentiate between the two groups. The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70, demonstrating the potential of wearable-based gait analysis for cognitive impairment detection. A sensor ablation study revealed that wrist-worn gyroscope data alone achieved a comparable AUC of 0.70, suggesting a moderate association between arm motion and cognitive impairment. The results further indicated that integrating smartphone accelerometers and smartwatch gyroscopes enhanced classification performance.This study is part of a broader multimodal research initiative that integrates gait analysis with voice recordings, phone usage patterns, and other behavioral data to improve cognitive impairment classification. Future work will explore multi-modal fusion techniques to enhance accuracy and reliability, with the long-term goal of developing accessible, real-world screening tools for early detection."

    "abstract": "Pattern Electroretinography (PERG) used in visual electrophysiology can assess macular cone and retinal ganglion cell function. However, its small amplitude and poor SNR limit clinical application, especially in rare eye diseases due to small sample sizes and low recording amplitudes. To better understand these limitations, this study implements the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to reconstruct signals of normal and rare pathologies. The goal is to remove unnecessary noise, assessing which wavelets are better for reconstructing PERG signals, and providing the first exploration of frequency bands that may be containing or removing pathologic content. After excluding recordings not meeting inclusion criteria, 358 PERG recordings in both normal and pathologic subjects were obtained from an open-source dataset on physio.net. Two different wavelets, Haar and Daubechies 2 (db2), were used for extracting biologically relevant frequency components. Reconstruction accuracy was quantified in terms of correlation coefficients r. Db2 wavelet yielded superior performance and gave high r (>0.95) consistently for most conditions. Across 110 normal control recordings, db2 detail and approximation levels 6 together yielded a r = 0.99, while other pathologies like Congenital Stationary Night Blindness reconstructed with only detail level 5 and approximation level 6 yielded an r = 0.91. This wavelet-based methodology retains diagnostic information and reveals subtle signal variations by isolating disease-relevant signal components while minimizing noise. These results reinforce DWT as a helpful tool to enhance PERG analysis in rare eye diseases by overcoming data scarcity for early diagnosis. Future work will involve integrating these methods into learning models where select decomposition levels will be leveraged to enhance prognostication."

Five algorithms were evaluated: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and RF, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics. SVM achieved the highest overall accuracy of 94.67%, with specific classification accuracies of 98.63 % for over-fermented, 93.03% for under-fermented, and 92.78% for well-fermented beans. Random Forest followed, while Naive Bayes showed the poorest performance. Cohen's kappa indicated near-perfect agreement for SVM with a score of 0.92. This study concludes that SVM, followed by Random Forest, is highly effective for classifying fermentation levels in Cebu cacao beans, offering valuable insights for quality control in the cacao industry."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Auscultation, a common diagnostic method, involves listening to heart sounds to detect valve contraction irregularities, with heart sound segmentation (i.e., identifying heartbeat phases) being a crucial first step. Due to the high level of expertise required for traditional auscultation, previous work has automated segmentation using digital sounds from stethoscopes or phonocardiographs; however, these methods depend on specialist medical devices, limiting continuous and wide usage. Earable devices now offer continuous heart sound capture via in-ear microphones (IEM) on Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) earphones, opening new possibilities for portable, continuous, out-of-hospital heart sound segmentation. However, techniques developed for phonocardiogram (PCG) signals are not directly applicable because of the distinct differences in signal characteristics between IEM and PCG signals. In this work, we demonstrate the unique potential of using in-ear cardiac sounds for heart sound segmentation. We begin by analysing the temporal and frequency differences between IEM and PCG signals, then introduce a U-Net deep learning model tailored for in-ear heart sound segmentation. Additionally, we propose a more stringent evaluation method for segmentation accuracy and use this to evaluate our method and the baselines. We collected data from 11 participants, and our model achieved 84% accuracy, outperforming established baselines."

However, with active-clamp control technique, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on could not be realized when the negative reverse current energy becomes small, resulting in notable switching loss and low efficiency in standby mode. In this paper, a standby power optimization method is proposed to reduce the switching loss of active-clamp flyback converter. By alternatively using valley-switching controlled switching cycles and active-clamp controlled switching cycles properly, partial ZVS turn-on and partial valley-switching turn-on are realized and lower switching loss could be realized. Finally, a 1MHz 65W prototype with 90~220 Vac input is built to verify the proposed control method. Experimental results show the efficiency under light load is improved and the standby power consumption is reduced."

Accurate sleep staging and disorder detection are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Studies in the literature have proposed PSG-based approaches and machine-learning methods utilizing single-modality signals. However, existing methods often lack multimodal, multilabel frameworks and address sleep stages and disorders classification separately. In this paper, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disorders’ correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder. The model is trained and tested using multimodal-multilabel sensory data (including photoplethysmogram, respiratory flow, and respiratory effort signals). The proposed method shows an overall accuracy (cohen’s Kappa) of 78% (0.66) for five-stage sleep classification and 74% (0.58) for sleep apnea classification. Moreover, we analyzed the encoder attention weights to clarify our models’ predictions and investigate the influence different features have on the models’ outputs. The result shows that identified patterns, such as respiratory troughs and peaks, make a higher contribution to the final classification process."

The results were analyzed in terms of electrical distribution in the nerve tissue and the corresponding neural response. Overall, our results demonstrate the strong impact of the NRs distribution on the electrical quantities, in terms of variability of both the electric field and the electric potential perceived in the tissue and along the fiber length. In addition, our results suggest that the 10% weight/volume is very likely to evoke an action potential, suggesting that with proper functionalization and displacement optimization of the NRs, the nanoparticles can effectively stimulate the neural activity. Our research provides quantitative support for the use of NRs in peripheral nerve tissue stimulation with a view to their integration as neural interfaces."

This study explores how pupil characteristics contribute to identifying emotional states in response to visual stimuli.First, a clustering analysis based on affective dimensions (Approach, Commitment, and Identity) was performed. Then, a segmentation based exclusively on pupillary characteristics was applied, allowing for the identification of significant differences in parameters such as dilation amplitude, contraction latency, and pupil variability. For more robust statistical results, we use generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).The results confirm that pupillometry is an effective tool for distinguishing emotional states, reinforcing its usefulness as a non-invasive method for emotional assessment. Pupillometry alone shows a significant relationship to the emotional dimensions of Commitment and Attention. Additionally, the importance of controlling external factors such as lighting and eye movement is highlighted to improve analysis accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting pass receivers in soccer. Through systematic experimentation, we explore which combinations of information types and representations improve prediction accuracy. We developed a four-stage experiment comparing different modalities (image, text, their combination) and additional information (match context, player statistics, sequence descriptions) using five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that LLMs possess basic tactical understanding applicable to pass receiver prediction. The highest average accuracy (33%) was achieved by combining the annotated image, image description, sequence before the pass, and player information—significantly higher than random chance (23%). At the individual model level, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.2 each reached 40% accuracy with their optimal input combinations. Interestingly, additional information does not always improve results; incorporating general match context reduced accuracy from 33% to 28%. LLMs still trail behind human performance (55% accuracy). But our work delivers concrete insights into multimodal input optimization for LLM-based sports predictions, establishing both a public benchmark dataset and a foundation for future research in AI-assisted soccer analytics."

The collected current - flux-linkage data are then fitted with one polynomial function per rotor position. The coefficients of the polynomials are then stored and used for time-based simulations. The model is first validated statically by analysing the regression error over the training dataset.

    "abstract": "Rice is one of the essential food crops consumed by every Filipino due to it being a good source of energy and protein. However, well-milled rice mostly encounters rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae) invasion during their prolonged storage, causing severe damage to rice grains. Several solutions have been proposed to address the problem, but these solutions may harm the consumers and oftentimes, lengthy, and tedious. This study developed an automated rice sieving device (ARSD) with a heat-controlled system for the reduction of Sitophilus oryzae, programmed in Arduino IDE (C++) for automation and genetic algorithm using Python for optimum angle of inclination for sieving. Results showed that the device can effectively and efficiently separate rice weevils and rice grains at sieving inclination of 15 degrees and can eliminate rice weevils within 1 minute at constant temperature of 54°C, exhibiting a 100% mortality rate. The optimum angle of inclination at 15.7° is obtained from the genetic algorithm using Python. Furthermore, at optimum angle of inclination and 1 minute heating time, the device is reliable in sieving 1 to 3 kilograms in four rice varieties namely Malagkit, Denorado, Angelica and Sinandomeng with an average percentage value of 97.9167, 96.1458 and 92.6042 with respect to their respective rice weights (1 kg, 2 kg, and 3kg), proving that ARSD is a potential solution in addressing rice weevil problems."

While IMSC evaluated the coupling between source-based morphometry (SBM) from structural MRI (sMRI) and static functional network connectivity (sFNC) from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), dIMSC incorporates the temporal dimension by linking SBM with dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC). Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we applied dIMSC to examine brain connectivity and evaluate sex differences in children aged 9-11. Our analysis revealed significant sex-specific patterns: males exhibited stronger positive coupling in the putamen and hippocampus, while females showed stronger coupling in the superior parietal lobule and anterior cingulate cortex. On average, 27.12% of timecourses exhibited positive coupling, 46.63% neutral coupling, and 26.25% negative coupling, reflecting a balanced alignment between structural and functional features. Sex differences were also observed in neutral and negative coupling groups, with males demonstrating stronger coupling in the caudate and middle cingulate gyrus, and females in the cerebellum and inferior parietal lobule. These findings suggest distinct developmental trajectories in brain network organization between sexes, potentially reflecting sex-specific adaptations in functional integration and compensatory mechanisms. The dIMSC method advances our earlier work by enabling time-sensitive analysis of brain structure-function coupling, providing a powerful framework for investigating neurodevelopmental processes and their implications for cognitive and behavioral outcomes.Clinical RelevanceThis study identifies sex-specific patterns in brain connectivity during childhood, offering insights that could inform sex-tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neurodevelopmental disorders."

However, the high cost and complexity of IHC staining procedures have driven research toward generating IHC-stained images directly from more readily available Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained images using image-to-image (I2I) translation methods. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the predictive capabilities of three state-of-the-art I2I models to enhance the quality and reliability of synthetic IHC images. Specifically, we designed a Convolutional Neural Network that takes as input a four-dimensional input comprising the outputs of three distinct models (each contributing an IHC prediction, which is an RGB three-dimensional output for each) and produces a final consensus image through a fusion mechanism. This ensemble method leverages the strengths of each model, leading to more robust and accurate IHC image generation. Extensive experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing single-model methods, achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) metrics.

    "abstract": "Passively levitated self-bearing machines provide the rotor drive and guidance within a single structure without requiring controllers, power electronics and sensors dedicated to the magnetic suspension, leading to compact, reliable and cost-effective systems. Electromechanical models describing their rotor dynamics have recently been derived and experimentally validated. However, these models do not account for non-idealities that could arise from manufacturing imperfections. In this context, this paper investigates the impact of an angular misalignment between the upper and lower windings of passively levitated self-bearing machines on the force and torque production. The existing electromechanical model is extended, highlighting that this misalignment slightly degrades the driving torque and the conventional passive restoring force, on the one hand, and creates additional force and torque components, on the other hand. Among the latter, those arising from the suspension currents are independent from the rotor axial displacement and are thus produced even in centred position, thereby potentially acting as disturbances. Finally, an experimental study is carried out, allowing to validate the suspension force produced by the machine in quasi-static conditions and to confirm the interest of accounting for this winding non-ideality in the model."

    "abstract": "Solid-state transformers (SSTs) containing a medium-voltage DC (MVDC) port serve as crucial elements of future AC/DC hybrid distribution networks. Such SSTs are usually expected to have DC fault ride-through capability since short-circuit faults occur frequently in DC transmission lines. This paper proposes a DC fault ride-through control for the hexagonal hybrid frequency solid-state transformer (HHF - SST). The topology uses full-bridge submodules instead of half-bridge ones, thereby enabling the arms to operate with bidirectional voltage output capability to effectively handle DC short-circuit faults. During MVDC port short-circuit faults, the system is able to either implement DC fault blocking or maintain continuous power transmission through the remaining two ports and achieve fault ride-through operation. Then, using the proposed control, when the fault is cleared, the MVDC port is smoothly recovered. Extensive simulation investigations verify the feasibility of the control strategy, demonstrating significant improvements in system resilience and reliability."

Methods: A custom measurement device was developed, consisting of an adjustable ring fitted to the finger and an integrated accelerometer sensor. Additionally, an ECG measurement device was included in the setup to acquire a 3-lead ECG reference signal. An autocorrelation-based algorithm was developed to preprocess the signals and extract heart rate values. Furthermore, several statistical metrics were calculated from the accelerometer signals to evaluate signal quality, with the goal of distinguishing between poor-quality and high-quality signals and to further study the possibility of implementing such a technique in a commercial device. Results: The proposed algorithm achieved an average mean absolute error of 1.88 bpm (beats per minute) when compared to reference ECG values, with estimations falling within ±5 bpm 93.3% of the time. When the signal quality based filtration was applied, the error decreased to 1.40 bpm, with estimations being within ±5 bpm 96.2% of the time. Conclusions: The findings indicate that this approach holds significant promise for integration into commercial smart rings, especially in conditions with limited motion artifacts."

    "abstract": "Eye rubbing is widely believed to significantly contribute to the development and progression of keratoconus, a potentially blinding disorder of the cornea. Keratoconus involves corneal apical thinning and scarring and can result in painful episodes of swelling of the cornea termed corneal hydrops. As a result, keratoconus can necessitate corneal transplantation for visual recovery and can result in irreversible vision loss in patients who are not candidates for corneal transplantation. Accurately quantifying eye rubbing behavior and rigorously assessing its impact on keratoconus progression are critical needs. Currently, eye rubbing assessment in individuals at risk for keratoconus onset or progression relies mainly on self-reports and occasional clinical observations, which are insufficient to quantify the effects of eye rubbing on keratoconus progression. In this paper, we introduce an innovative deep learning-based analysis framework for real-time, automatic detection of eye rubbing using sensor data from wrist-based wearable devices. To develop and validate the proposed system, a dataset of 1,068 non-overlapping recordings from 9 subjects was built. Our results show that the framework effectively identifies eye rubbing behaviors during normal daily activities, achieving an average F1-score of 93.55% and AUC of 96.23%. This system offers a valuable tool for ophthalmologists and researchers by providing rapid, reliable quantification of eye rubbing behavior in patients."

However, low tracer concentrations can diminish the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnetization signal, resulting in significant noise artifacts in MPI images reconstructed using the X-space method. Hardware improvements have high complexity, while traditional methods lack robustness to different noise levels, making it difficult to improve the quality of low concentration MPI images. In this paper, we introduced a synergistic spatial-frequency feature-guided approach for MPI image denoising and quality enhancement, based on a sparse lightweight transformer model. Specifically, the Fast Fourier Adjustment (FFA) module employs the Fast Fourier Transform and a series of convolutional operations to generate frequency-domain feature maps, which co-guide the network reconstruction with spatial-domain features. The Spatial and Frequency Guidance (SAG) module integrates pixel-level and implicit frequency detail features by learning dual-domain spatial-frequency representations. It consists of a Layer Normalization (LN), a Spatial and Frequency Fusion Attention (SFA) block, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep learning techniques in MPI image denoising and generates high-quality MPI images even at low concentrations."

    "abstract": "Tracking animal movement is an important aspect of neuroscience research, particularly in studies wishing to investigate the relationships between behavioral changes and neural activity. To achieve this, treadmill systems are commonly utilized to provide controlled environments for monitoring animal locomotion. However, existing treadmill systems rely on measuring only the rotational speed of its motors or belt, failing to capture changes in an animal's actual position and velocity. This limitation is problematic for neural correlation studies, where accurate measurements of animal movement are essential. To address these concerns, we present a novel modular tracking system that enables real-time monitoring of animal position and velocity during treadmill-based rodent experiments at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. This system comprises of interlocking, 3D-printed modules equipped with infrared (IR) break-beam sensors, allowing customizable configurations for diverse experimental setups. Additionally, it supports both digital and analog output triggers, for integration with neural recording systems to synchronize data acquisition of treadmill, behavioral, and neural data. In this study, we validate our system by comparing position and velocity data collected from mice moving on a treadmill at 0.1 m/s against measurements obtained from DeepLabCut, a leading machine learning-based pose-estimation tool. The results of our investigation demonstrate strong correlations between our system's real-time position and velocity measurements against post-processed video tracking data with an average Spearman’s rank correlation of r = 0.8 for each. Overall, this versatile system provides an accurate and accessible retrofit solution for tracking animal movement in controlled neuroscience experiments, enhancing the precision of behavioral analysis.Clinical Relevance—The described IR system offers a practical solution for researchers who study movement disorders in rodent models, as it provides precise, real-time locomotor tracking without the need for complex computer vision analyses."

Understanding these signatures provides critical insights for designing wearable health-monitoring devices. In particular, constructing three-dimensional (3D) spectroscopic graphs of molecular spectra enables the optimization of multi-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, improving their accuracy and performance. However, no prior work has systematically mapped spectroscopic signatures to optimize wavelength combinations, slowing advancements in multi-wavelength PPG sensor deployment. To address this gap, we introduce OpenSpectro, an open-source spectroscopic profiling platform for visualizing and sharing molecular spectral data, particularly human physiological biomarkers. OpenSpectro features a preliminary spectroscopic database containing 17 biomarkers and a spectral attention optimization model that identifies customized wavelength attention weights for each biomarker."

    "abstract": "Utilizing adversarial samples is essential for assessing the robustness of intelligent classification models. However, certain adversarial sample generation methods based on the grey-box approach face challenges, including low attack efficiency and limited interpretability. This paper presents the Score-based Gray-box Single-pixel Attacks (SGSA) method, a novel approach for generating adversarial samples. Initially, the feature map of the model’s final layer is extracted, along with computing the discrepancy between the predicted score of each feature map and the original prediction score. By employing the Leaky ReLU activation function, the score of each pixel is computed. Subsequently, these scores are sorted in ascending order. Initiating the attack from the pixel with the lowest score, the most effective attack direction is determined by comparing the outcomes of both forward and reverse adversarial attacks on each pixel. The results demonstrate that this method not only achieves high attack efficiency but also offers interpretability in selecting attack locations, and the attack efficiency has doubled. Furthermore, this method offers valuable guidance for both testing and enhancing the model’s robustness to some degree."

    "abstract": "Recently, wideband beamforming realized by extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) systems have garnered significant interest as a means to dramatically improve throughput of next generation (xG) networks. However, traditional phase shifter (PS)-based beamforming schemes might not work well in wideband ELAA systems due to the beam squint effect, where beams at different frequencies become misaligned. While the use of true time delay (TTD) can mitigate the beam squint effect by generating frequency-dependent beamforming vectors, the conventional TTD-based beamforming schemes suffer from significant array gain loss caused by the discrepancies between the desired directional beams and the generated beams. This beam misalignment issue becomes even more pronounced in the wideband ELAA systems due to the nonlinear near-field characteristics described by the spherical wave propagation. In this paper, we propose a wideband dynamic array-of-subarrays (WDAoSA) architecture that dynamically configures connections between TTDs and PS subarrays using a switch network. By optimizing the subarray connections as well as the TTD time delays and PS phase shifts, WDAoSA can effectively maximize the array gain of wideband ELAA systems. Numerical results demonstrate that WDAoSA achieves significant improvements in terms of array gain and spectral efficiency over the conventional TTD-based beamforming schemes."

    "abstract": "Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction; however, these methods often overlook the physical principles underlying EIT, thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges."

This study presents a control methodology that effectively performs utility-synchronization DER-based microgrid and ensures continuous supply to locally connected loads during mode transitions. Additionally, it maintains power quality of microgrid, even under unbalanced load conditions. Proposed power quality feature is achieved using an adaptive current control based on generalized robust logarithmic family (GRLF) that utilizes least mean square (LMS) based weight updating. This algorithm offers superior convergence and accuracy under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. GRLF-LMS adaptive current control is utilized for fundamental extraction from input current signals. Control estimates phase angle and frequency of microgrid using a double loop inertia phase-locked loop (DLI-PLL) method. Double-loop structure includes a synchronous reference frame PLL, which operates in a dual-loop fashion to provide synchronization and inherent anti-disturbance capability. An overall control is tested on an experimental setup in emulated adverse operating conditions."

ICP-based attacks include two essential steps: generating tailored attack payloads and breaking through the session-ID-based PLC defenses. Traditional approaches to performing the two steps rely on laborious manual analysis. To analyze the threats posed by ICP-based attacks to commercial-off-the-shelf PLCs, we propose AIAF, an Automated ICP-based Attack Framework leveraging proprietary binary protocols, which operates automatically through an offline construction of effective attack payloads and an online ICP-based attack test. We have evaluated AIAF with 9 mainstream PLCs, covering 9 protocols, showing that AIAF can reverse engineer 12 kinds of session-ID negotiation (6 value-changed and 6 value-same), generate attack payloads, and execute 35 ICP-based attacks with a 94.29% success rate. Our further Internet-wide evaluation reveals that over 28K PLCs exposed to the Internet are vulnerable to ICP-based attacks."

We first design a head location module to generate human head location information from a head query. Then, an error analysis demonstrates that the primary error source of the existing GOP model is in gaze estimation, which is caused by the difficulty in predicting gaze points by directly regressing heatmaps. Therefore, we introduce cone prediction into the model training stage, allowing the middle-layer features of the gaze regressor to build the relationship between the target human and objects before regressing the gaze point. An oriented gradient mechanism is proposed in this process to ensure the object detection performance is not affected by cone information. Finally, we conducted very detailed and sufficient experiments to verify the superiority of our method on the GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets. At the same time, we also achieve advantages compared to the human-target gaze estimation methods on the GazeFollowing, VideoAttentionTarget, and ChildPlay datasets."

    "abstract": "Prompt learning is an effective way to adapt pre-trained models to downstream tasks by training a small number of additional learnable prompts. Recent studies address several early challenges by combining generalized knowledge from frozen pre-trained VL models with task-specific knowledge from training data as guidance for prompt learning. However, existing methods still struggle with the generalization-adaptation (GA) trade-off dilemma: excessive reliance on generalized knowledge hinders adaptation to downstream tasks, while overemphasis on task-specific knowledge undermines the inherent generalization capabilities of pre-trained models. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt learning method called Prompt Learning with Knowledge Regularization (PLKR). PLKR effectively mitigates the GA trade-off dilemma by offering greater flexibility in adapting to task-specific knowledge while minimizing the disruption of pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, we propose category-invariant and topology-invariant knowledge regularization to preserve generalized knowledge: the former enhances category-level discriminative capabilities while allowing flexible task-specific learning, and the latter maintains global topological stability during adaptation to new tasks. Through the proposed regularization, PLKR improves the performance on both base and new tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four representative tasks over 11 datasets. Experimental results show our method outperforms existing SOTA methods by a large margin."

However, controlling and standardizing the CSC manufacturing process is cumbersome due to manual handling and the large number of parameters affecting the process. Therefore, we developed a camera-based tool for the in-process evaluation of the droplets that later form the cores of CSCs and used it to investigate the influence of two process parameters on the CSC core diameter in-process rather than post-process. For this, we obtained images of the droplets mid-fall and extracted their mean diameter to compare it to the final CSC core size, which was determined by microscopy. To obtain CSC cores of different sizes, we changed the flow rate of the droplet solution and the gauge size of the cannula, obtaining six sets of process parameters. In general, the diameter of the CSC cores decreased with a decreasing cannula diameter. The influence of the flow rate was only significant for the smaller of two cannula diameters with higher flow rates leading to smaller CSC cores but also a larger variability in diameter. When we compared the diameters of the droplets in-process to the diameters of the CSC cores post-process, we found a significant correlation (Pearson-Coefficient 0.94) between the two. Our results demonstrate the potential of using an in-process monitoring approach to make the process tuning procedure more efficient, even enabling automated tuning through a feedback loop."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), prompted by the need for highly efficient motor drives, underscores the importance of fully exploiting machine operation. Under such operating conditions, the machine is exposed to high mechanical and electromagnetic stress. It is therefore essential to estimate stress levels on various components and focus the analysis on the most critical ones. One of the critical components is the rotor magnets of the machine. The need to monitor the state of health of the rotor magnets has led to the definition of noninvasive and sensorless algorithms to estimate their temperature. Like the performance of the machine, in particular, the magnetic properties of the rotor magnets are affected by the operating temperature. When the machine approaches its limit, accurately estimating the rotor magnet temperature is a critical task to prevent irreversible damage to the machine. In this paper, an online algorithm has been developed to monitor the magnet temperature of six-phase PMSMs, based on the analysis of the machine's back electromotive force (back-EMF). The proposed algorithm has been validated through experimental tests conducted under different thermal stress conditions."

    "abstract": "Functional classification in wheelchair rugby relies on accurate muscle function assessment, but current methods still remain subjective. This study examined wrist muscle activation in wheelchair rugby athletes and able-bodied individuals using mechanomyography (MMG), a non-invasive technique for assessing muscle vibrations. MMG signals were collected from 84 athletes and 20 able-bodied volunteers during wrist flexion, extension, radial, and ulnar deviation. Data were analyzed in time (RMS) and frequency (MF) domains to identify activation differences. The results have shown significant variations between functional classes and controls (p < 0.05), particularly along the Z-axis, suggesting distinct neuromuscular adaptations. Athletes with greater impairment exhibited altered recruitment patterns, while those in higher functional classes exhibited more stable muscle responses. These findings support MMG’s potential as an objective tool for functional classification in adapted sports, though further research is needed to refine its application."

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent rheumatic disease, affecting an increasing number of people. This work proposes an innovative methodology based on texture analysis on femorotibial cartilage and T2 mapping on femoropatellar cartilage in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify early cartilage degeneration biomarkers, imperceptible to the human eye. Two distinct analyses were conducted: (1) On the one hand, in the femorotibial cartilage, 3D manual segmentation was performed and a radiomic approach was applied extracting 43 textural features; (2) On the other hand, in the femoropatellar cartilage through the elaboration of cartigrams, 27 features derived from T2 relaxation times were extracted to evaluate the deep, intermediate and superficial layers of the cartilage. The database included 100 subjects, distributed between controls and patients with different stages of OA according to the Kellgren & Lawrence scale (I-IV). In both analyses the KNN model is positioned as the most effective model followed by the SVM, demonstrating its potential in the early diagnosis of OA using advanced medical imaging techniques and machine learning methods.Clinical Relevance— The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is usually made in advanced stages, at which time treatment options are reduced. MRI makes it possible to detect joint alterations even before there are indications in other radiological tests or clinical symptoms suggesting joint deterioration. This study explores the correlation of MRI findings with clinical features, promoting the integration of advanced technologies into clinical practice to improve the accuracy and speed of OA diagnosis, thus contributing to more effective and personalized interventions."

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are at risk of developing stroke after the intervention, usually detected via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). Previous studies suggested the maintenance of cerebral autoregulation (CA) as derived from time series analysis of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and mean cerebral blood velocity (MCBv) after SAVR, but the association of CA markers with the presence of recent ischemic lesions was not assessed so far. This study investigates closed-loop cerebrovascular control via causal cross-spectral analysis in 23 subjects (19 males, age 57±16 years) who recently underwent SAVR. Analyses were performing at rest in supine position (REST) and during an active standing test (STAND). Traditional MAP-MCBv coherence (K<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) was computed as well as causal coherence (K<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) was assessed from MAP to MCBv, i.e. along the pressure-to-flow arm, and from MCBv to MAP, i.e. along the flow-to-pressure arm, in the frequency bands typically used to describe CA. As detected via DW-MRI, 9 patients exhibited recent ischemic lesions (classified as STROKE) and 15 did not (noSTROKE). Results showed that STROKE patients showed an increased variability of MCBv during STAND and an inability to decouple MAP and MCBv variability series during STAND compared to REST, suggesting possible CA impairment. Trends in the coupling strength were observed in the high frequency band (0.15-0.4 Hz) regardless of the direction of the MAP-MCBv interactions. The proposed techniques allowed the investigation of the closed loop relationship between MAP and MCBv in association with damages of the brain microcirculation after SAVRClinical Relevance— Cerebral autoregulation might be reduced in patients exhibiting recent ischemic brain lesions after surgical aortic valve replacement."

The motivation of this method is the fact that industrial DSPs have limited computation power and the real time flux oriented control needs relatively high computation power, especially for the flux estimator. This method does not require the flux estimation as it assumes the control system is oriented, therefore, the flux control loop is also avoided. The control algorithm had been implemented in the Matlab Simulink environment, using the dSP ACE RTI toolbox, for the DS1103 prototyping board. The dSPACE board had been used for the control of the traction system experimental stand."

Despite its global prevalence, accurate prediction of MetS remains challenging due to issues such as class imbalance, data scarcity, and methodological inconsistencies in existing studies. In this paper, we address these challenges by systematically evaluating and optimizing machine learning (ML) models for MetS prediction, leveraging advanced data balancing techniques and counterfactual analysis. Multiple ML models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, TabNet, etc., were trained and compared under various data balancing techniques such as random oversampling (ROS), SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN. Additionally, we introduce MetaBoost<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">‡</sup>, a novel hybrid framework that integrates SMOTE, ADASYN, and CTGAN, optimizing synthetic data generation through weighted averaging and iterative weight tuning to enhance the model’s performance (achieving up to a 1.87% accuracy improvement over individual balancing techniques). A comprehensive counterfactual analysis is conducted to quantify the feature-level changes required to shift individuals from high-risk to low-risk categories. The results indicate that blood glucose (50.3%) and triglycerides (46.7%) were the most frequently modified features, highlighting their clinical significance in MetS risk reduction. Additionally, probabilistic analysis shows elevated blood glucose (85.5% likelihood) and triglycerides (74.9% posterior probability) as the strongest predictors. This study not only advances the methodological rigor of MetS prediction but also provides actionable insights for clinicians and researchers, highlighting the potential of ML in mitigating the public health burden of metabolic syndrome."

To achieve clinically meaningful outcomes, such systems must operate with high spatiotemporal precision. This work aims to demonstrate a proof-of-concept neuromorphic BCI that processes neural spike events in near-real time, without necessitating preprocessing besides signal filtering and spike detection. Methods - We developed a system that acquires neural signals and streams spike events into a spiking neural network (SNN) running on SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware. We evaluated the system’s performance using both in vivo recordings from mouse visual cortex and simulated neural waveforms. We measured the roundtrip latency, defined as the time from spike detection to an output spike generated by the SNN. Results - Under baseline conditions with no hidden SNN layers, mean roundtrip latency was 4.69 ms (±1.70 ms). Adding hidden layers increased latency by approximately 3.65 ms per layer, reflecting the computational overhead of deeper networks. The system successfully detected and processed spikes in near real-time, demonstrating that neuromorphic hardware can manage spike-based input at speeds suitable for closed-loop intervention. Discussion - These findings indicate that neuromorphic SNNs can rapidly process neural signals, providing a foundation for closed-loop BCIs capable of bypassing damaged neural pathways. Future efforts will involve implementing stimulation protocols and functional SNNs. Such developments may ultimately facilitate more effective, flexible, and power-efficient neuroprosthetic devices."

The research adopted a questionnaire by Caplan (2005) and employed non-probability purposive sampling techniques in which the respondents were directly involved. The finding reveals that applied tools in leadership practices are statistically substantial to the leadership performance of public administrations. The study discloses that using or not using applied tools in leadership affects leadership performance.

To solve the problems of the limitations of current multi-view information collaborative utilization, consistency constraint stability, and manifold feature learning, we propose a deep Grassmannian multi-view subspace clustering method based on spatial-channel synergistic attention and JS divergence constraint. Specifically, the method first designs a feature extraction module based on spatial-channel synergistic attention to map raw input samples into feature subspaces. Subsequently, a subspace mapping module further projects these subspace features onto the Grassmann manifold. Then, deep subspace learning is performed on the constructed Grassmannian manifold network. Finally, a contrastive learning mechanism incorporating JS divergence is introduced to obtain more discriminative clustering assignments. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of our method."

    "abstract": "Driver emotion recognition plays a crucial role in driver monitoring systems, enhancing human-autonomy interactions and the trustworthiness of Autonomous Driving (AD). Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multichannel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the Nested Mixture of Experts (NMoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying foundation model (FM), along with the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the raw ECG signal, is treated as a separate expert. The embeddings extracted from these experts are fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset. The proposed architecture outperforms its counterparts, achieving an average subject-level classification accuracy of 70.00% and F1 score of 69.26%, across four emotional states: anger, fear, sadness, and surprise."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the development of electric motors that generate static unloading forces to enable gas foil bearing implementation in large-scale turbomachinery. Foil bearings are increasingly being considered as a bearing solution for high speed motor shafts in hermetic environments. However, they experience wear during startup and shutdown, preventing their use with large turbomachine shafts. To overcome this challenge, the paper leverages bearingless motor technology to develop electric machines capable of controlling radial forces to reduce the effective shaft weight at low speeds. The paper presents a detailed investigation into design requirements that large, hermetic turbomachines impose on the electric machine and bearings. It then evaluates the feasibility of utilizing various bearingless motor design topology features to meet these requirements. Since the electric machine rarely needs to create radial forces (only at startup/shutdown), the aim is to ensure the machine retains maximum performance when it is not producing radial forces. A multi-objective FEA-based optimization is presented to characterize the design space, demonstrating that with careful design, it is feasible to develop high-performance electric machines that add capability to unload their shaft weight without compromising power density and efficiency."

This study investigates the development and efficacy of a bipolar plasma nozzle designed for use on non-conductive surfaces, such as natural teeth. A proof-of-concept experiment was performed using a prototype plasma system (helium + 1 % oxygen used as working gas), with in vitro tests on bacterial agar plates of E. coli and S. aureus. The results demonstrate that plasma treatment effectively reduces bacterial concentration, with inhibition zones increasing with treatment duration, reaching two orders of magnitude reduction at 10 minutes of treatment. These findings support the potential of plasma technology as a novel method for periodontal disinfection, making way for further clinical applications.Clinical Relevance— This work provides proof-of-concept for the disinfection and treatment of inflamed surfaces in periodontology using a novel cold atmospheric plasma jet device."

This study investigates the feasibility of using commercial smartwatches and smartphones to replace laboratory-grade inertial measurement units (IMUs) for performance monitoring in practical shooting. Twelve athletes participated in trials, with data collected using full-body IMUs and reduced sensor setups. Key actions—shooting, running, reloading, and extraction—were identified and classified using binary classifiers and multi-label strategies. Results showed that a combination of sensors on the dominant wrist and hip provided optimal accuracy, outperforming single-sensor setups and audio-based configurations. Additionally, training classifiers on complete exercise sessions yielded better performance than isolated actions. The findings demonstrate the potential of commercial devices for HAR in practical shooting, offering a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for real-world deployment. This approach could be extended to other sports, balancing accuracy, cost, and usability."

To achieve precise detection of stains (mud, dust, and oil) on specific tunnel wall fabrics in specific environments and meet the maintenance needs of tunnels, this paper proposes a detection scheme based on the U-Net model. In the preprocessing stage, this method eliminates color interference through dynamic grayscale conversion, enhances contrast by using histogram equalization that retains high-frequency textures, and suppresses noise by applying weighted median filtering based on texture complexity and noise level. The preprocessed images are then input into the U-Net model. The encoder extracts deep features through the DoubleConv module and pooling operations, while the decoder restores the image dimensions through upsampling and feature concatenation, and finally outputs the stain prediction results through the convolutional layer. During training, a weighted cross-entropy loss function is used, giving higher weights to the stain areas to enhance the model's learning ability for stain features. Experimental results show that the image preprocessing operations can effectively enhance the stain features and reduce noise, improving detection performance. This method, through the innovative combination of the preprocessing process and the U-Net model, achieves efficient and precise detection of stains on tunnel wall fabrics, with a detection accuracy rate of 90% for mud, dust, and oil stains."

There are different applications, e.g. in ophthalmology, dermatology, cardiology and recently OCT image based motion compensation has been considered. However, OCT suffers from speckle noise which affects image quality and subsequent interpretation. We propose denoising based on unsupervised 3D convolutional Autoencoder (AE) and systematically evaluate the model on in vivo and post mortem datasets. Moreover, we study motion detection as a subsequent task and to investigate the effects of AE based denoising. Our results demonstrate that speckle noise in the OCT images can lead to substantial outliers. Denoising based on AEs is effective in reducing the outliers and results in improved motion detection. Furthermore, the proposed AE processes OCT volumes in 0.5 ms, making it suitable for real-time applications. Finally, the results illustrate that the AE can effectively improve motion detection performance on in vivo data, despite being trained on different data. In conclusion, our AE model presents a simple and unsupervised deep learning approach to obtain fast denoising adapted to OCT imaging. For motion detection, denoising can be crucial to avoid artifacts due to outliers.Clinical relevance: This work provides an efficient denoising Autoencoder for fast data processing that can be applied in various clinical scenarios to improve noisy 3D Optical Coherence Tomography images."

    "abstract": "Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are beginning to see wider adoption in microgrids and inverter-based-resource (IBR) penetrated grids, and are primarily used to establish grid voltage under a wide array of conditions. In existing literature, GFM control is almost exclusively applied using voltage-source inverters (VSIs). However, due to the inherent maximum current limitations of available semiconductor devices, VSIs require added layers of control to regulate and limit inverter-side current during grid-fault conditions. These limitations complicate the real-world application of GFM functionality in VSIs, and higher-order control structures are required as a result, along with careful tuning. In the following study, GFM control is instead applied to a buck-type current-source inverter (CSI) using a combination of continuous control set (CCS) and finite control set (FCS) model predictive control (MPC) that will be referred to herein as hybrid model predictive control (HMPC). The result features simple topology, inherent current limiting capabilities, and an intuitive control structure. Verification was performed on a IMVA/630V system via MATLAB/Simulink, and simulation results demonstrate strong performance on voltage establishment, power regulation, and low-voltage ride through under grid-fault conditions, highlighting its potential as a competent alternative to VSIs in GFM applications."

    "abstract": "The aortic baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive nerve endings in the vascular wall of the aortic arch that play a vital role in cardiovascular autoregulation by dynamically responding to changes in aortic blood pressure. Inspired by this unique stretch-based pressure sensing mechanism, we developed two artificial aortic baroreceptors (AABs) to monitor aortic blood pressure by measuring aortic wall stretch in a synthetic aorta: one AAB designed for circumferential sensitivity (C-AAB) and one designed for radial sensitivity (R-AAB). Both AABs were developed by combining a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based barometric pressure sensor with a soft silicone probe, decoupling probe deformation from signal transmission for higher durability. Both AABs were integrated with a soft synthetic aorta, designed to represent the average aortic dimensions of a healthy population, enabling us to evaluate each AAB’s linearity, sensitivity, hysteretic response, and accuracy from 0 mmHg to the maximum operating pressure of natural aortic baroreceptors (180 mmHg). Across this range, the R-AAB demonstrated an approximately linear response, while the C-AAB demonstrated a quadratic response. The C-AAB demonstrated ten-fold higher average sensitivity than the R-AAB (-0.978 mmHg/mmHg vs. 0.093 mmHg) and demonstrated an increased sensitivity within typical healthy and hypertensive blood pressure ranges (60 – 140 mmHg). Hysteresis increased with frequency and remained low for both AABs. Following calibration, both AABs successfully monitored physiological aortic blood pressure waveforms at 60 beats per minute and approximately 95/65 mmHg pulse pressure. The calibrated C-AAB monitored blood pressure with a lower root mean squared error than the R-AAB (0.91 mmHg vs. 1.6 mmHg). The superior sensitivity of the C-AAB may suggest that the natural aortic baroreceptors are inherently more sensitive to circumferential stretch, although this must be further investigated. These experiments demonstrate the C-AAB and R-AAB’s potential for blood pressure and cardiovascular monitoring in various in-vitro and in-vivo physiological and biomedical investigations.Clinical Relevance— This study recapitulates the stretch-based blood pressure monitoring ability of the natural aortic baroreceptors in two artificial aortic baroreceptors (AABs). These AABs could be conveniently utilized for blood pressure and cardiovascular monitoring in in-vitro or in-vivo physiological studies, such as those involving baroreflex, autoregulation, or cardiovascular medical devices, including mechanical circulatory support."

    "abstract": "Polysomnography is an extensive evaluation of several physiological measures and the gold standard technique for clinical sleep assessment. However, this technique is resource-expensive and often unfeasible over multiple nights. Ongoing research has shown that ear-EEG technology combined with the model-based automatic sleep scoring can be used for long-term sleep monitoring. More work is needed to robustly adapt clinical polysomnography-based sleep scoring models to at-home ear-EEG-based sleep patterns. Here, we investigated the main and combined benefits of utilizing three different strategies to adapt sleep scoring models from scalp- (part of polysomnography) to ear-EEG: 1) fine-tuning of the sleep scoring model to left-right mastoid scalp-EEG, 2) fine-tuning of the sleep scoring model to ear-EEG and 3) ensemble prediction. The results showed that all strategies applied in isolation improve the sleep scoring performance on ear-EEG data, relative to the not adapted model. With combined two or three strategies, sleep scoring performance on ear-EEG reached performance comparable with sleep scoring on scalp-EEG (from κ 0.71 to 0.83; from κ 0.67 to 0.77; from κ 0.57 to 0.68 in three data sets).Clinical Relevance— This study demonstrates that current crosshead ear-EEG technology, combined with advanced sleep scoring models, enables accurate at-home sleep monitoring. Furthermore, tailoring sleep scoring models to ear-EEG data enhances identification of the sleep architecture."

    "abstract": "Success in gait rehabilitation is one of the most important factors determining the quality of life in patients with neuronal injuries. Although all four limbs are involved in human gait physiology, most rehabilitation approaches separate the upper limbs from the gait rehabilitation system. We proposed autoencoder-based networks with residual blocks, ResNetAE and ResUNet, for an interlimb gait trajectory synchronization system for the purpose of active rehabilitation system control. Gait data was collected from healthy subjects (N=30), consisting of early adulthood (18–35 years, N=10), middle adulthood (36–60 years, N=10), and elderly individuals (over 61 years, N=10). Leveraging the Xsens MVN Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) system, the positions of each body segment were extracted and synchronized in pairs. Utilizing the X and Z coordinate positions from the hands and feet, the model showed promising results in predicting two pairs of ipsilateral and contralateral interlimb trajectories, achieving the best Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0472 meters, a time error on the X-axis of 33.33 milliseconds, and a Phase Synchronization Index (PSI) of 96.70% when compared with the LSTMAE baseline (0.0547 meters, 33.33 milliseconds, and 92.83%) on unseen subjects. The models’ performance is sufficient for further interlimb phase synchronization studies and for investigating their capability in the interlimb-aware gait rehabilitation exoskeleton systems."

A survey of published quench data reveals that stored magnetic energy and peak field jointly influence quench survivability. A 36.5 MW, 120 rpm partially superconducting machine design is then introduced to assess feasibility at the multi-megawatt scale: the 20 K design attains a 6.55 T air-gap field, 638 Nm/L torque density, and a 22 min charging time constant through stainless-steel co-winding. Experimental efforts on quench behavior are also conducted: quench trials on 2×280 and 2×450-turn NI REBCO coils survived twelve repeated quenches at 180 A with peak temperatures of 80–90 K and no degradation. These test campaigns provide insights into quench behaviors of NI REBCO coils, guiding analysis and design approaches for the next large-scale coils. Ongoing work will extend testing to a 16-coil CRUISE rotor and a ship-scale coil, and will refine distributed quench models to map safe operating envelopes."

The application of robotics possesses the capacity to considerably influence the attainment of 13 out of 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the implementation of robust control systems that can effectively identify and isolate malfunctions is crucial for ensuring the secure and efficient operation of robotic technologies across various applications. This article proposes an approach for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) in a 6 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) robot using the Negative Selection Algorithm within an Artificial Immune System framework. The proposed methodology is inspired by the inherent ability of the human body's immune system to recognize and eradicate anomalous cells, to establish a resilient and reliable fault detection and isolation mechanism for robotic systems. Utilizing the data generated from the UR10 robot model in MATLAB, the algorithm underwent training and testing procedures using both normal and anomalous data sets. The NSA demonstrates a high level of accuracy with a detection rate of 93.13%, an average false alarm rate of 0.36%, and an F-score of 95.24%. The NSA achieves this level of performance within an average detection elapse time of 0.20 seconds.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel SPICE modeling methodology for accurately predicting the dynamic switching behavior of parallel-connected Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. In high-power converter applications, parametric dispersion among nominally identical SiC devices-such as variations in gate threshold voltage, transconductance and conduction resistance-poses a significant challenge to balanced current sharing and thermal balance. By leveraging Double Pulse Test (DPT) experimental data, the proposed approach addresses the critical issue of parametric dispersion in SiC devices by enabling the emulation of individual device behavior under transient switching conditions, which is essential for designing reliable high-power converters. The proposed technique does not require modification of the internal SPICE model of the MOSFET, which is often encrypted or vendor-specific, instead, external gate-driving parameters are selectively tuned to emulate the dynamic response of each device. This preserves model integrity while significantly improving simulation accuracy, supporting a wide range of application domains, including electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and industrial power electronics. The proposed methodology enhances the design of robust parallel-connected systems, ensuring improved current sharing and reduced thermal stress."

By optimizing the size of the busbar, a minimized stray inductance is achieved in the current cumulation loops (CCLs), leading to better switching performance and improvements in voltage overshoot.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of technology, the availability of medical data has increased, enabling the training of deep learning models for automatic analysis of medical images. However, annotating this data can be costly. To address this challenge, self-supervised learning has emerged, allowing models to be pre-trained on unannotated data using pretext tasks before fine-tuning them. In this study, we propose a novel pretext task specifically designed for neuroimaging applications and demonstrate its effectiveness in a use case involving stroke lesion segmentation on CT scans. The task leverages the stroke ASPECTS score by first training the model to segment the ten regions defined by this score using an initial dataset, followed by fine-tuning on the target data. Unlike conventional pretext tasks originally developed for natural images, our approach is specifically adapted to the unique challenges of neuroimaging, achieving improved segmentation performance and stability, showing that this pretext task, specifically tailored for stroke lesion segmentation is more efficient than generic tasks for self-supervised learning.Clinical relevance— Stroke lesion segmentation on CT is vital for diagnosis and treatment, as CT is commonly used despite its lower contrast compared to MRI. However, segmentation is challenging due to limited labeled data and CT’s low contrast. Our self-supervised learning pretext task, tailored for neuroimaging and applied here to stroke lesions, improves accuracy and reliability, supporting its use in real-world clinical workflows."

    "abstract": "Variable-Flux Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (VFMs) employ low-coercivity permanent magnets whose Magnetization State (MS) can be dynamically adjusted through controlled current pulses. Achieving accurate MS regulation under load, while avoiding torque discontinuities, requires injecting current pulses that are not aligned with the magnets, resulting in asymmetric demagnetization. These nonlinear magnetization and demagnetization dynamics are not captured by conventional control-oriented models, and are typically analyzed using computationally expensive finite element analysis (FEA) co-simulations, which are impractical for control development and calibration. This paper presents an enhanced, high-fidelity dynamic model of VFMs, optimized for efficient simulation in Matlab-Simulink. The model leverages precomputed lookup tables, obtained from FEA or experimental data, including inverse flux linkage characteristics and novel remagnetization and demagnetization maps along orthogonal (x-y) magnet axes, enabling accurate representation of asymmetric PM behavior. Validation against transient FEA simulations demonstrates that the proposed model achieves comparable accuracy while reducing simulation time from 124 minutes to just 14 seconds, making it well suited for real-time-oriented applications such as controller design and system calibration."

However, the assessment is easily affected by subjective judgment, and patients with DOC are usually unable to provide adequate behavioral responses. Previous studies have indicated that emotion recognition-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can assist in the assessment of DOC, yet they lack more specific and quantitative indicators. This study is the first to apply electroencephalography (EEG) microstates for emotion recognition in patients with DOC. Specifically, EEG microstates were utilized to capture crucial spatio-temporal features of EEG signals, simplifying the rapidly changing EEG signals into a series of prototype topoplots. In this study, EEG data was recorded from 9 patients with DOC and 11 healthy volunteers. Among healthy participants, our system achieved an average classification accuracy of 94.16%, effectively demonstrating its success in eliciting and recognizing emotions. When applied to patients with DOC, the system yielded an average classification accuracy of 77.94%. The results of this study indicate that EEG microstate dynamics are associated with conscious processing in patients with DOC. However, further validation in a larger patient dataset is required to confirm these preliminary findings."

The algorithm applied for RL is the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, which is composed of two critics and one actor. By using TD3, it is possible to prevent overestimation in the critic's value function, which can lead to selecting sub-optimal actions instead of optimal ones.

The proposed method extends existing mathematical models by incorporating torque-dependent model of SRM core parameters, expressed as fifth-order polynomial functions, to suppress the third harmonic component of radial force. Unlike previous approaches that rely on iterative optimization or assume linear core behavior, the proposed method accommodates current to be calculated without iterative computation, enabling continuous reference current to be generated. The effectiveness of this method is validated using finite element simulation, with the experiment setup currently underway. The proposed method can achieve the target torque with minimum error at all torque operating regions with a low radial force ripple of 4% at low torque, 18% at medium torque, and 29% at high torque, respectively. These findings suggest that the proposed method can enhance SRM performance in terms of noise reduction and vibration control."

    "abstract": "Wire bonding is one of the mainstream connection methods in current integrated circuit packaging. With the rise in gold wire prices, copper wire has gradually gained wide application due to its lower cost and better electrical and thermodynamic performance. However, the development time of copper wire bonding technology is relatively short, lacking assessment methods for high-reliability applications. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the reliability of copper wire bonding. This paper proposes using wire bond pull force as the assessment parameter. A reliability assessment method of copper wire bonding under temperature cycling based on kernel density estimation is proposed. This method utilizes an adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation. The difficulties of destructive test data not conforming to common sample distributions are overcome. Finally, a case analysis is conducted to validate the feasibility of this method. The Gaussian kernel function is used to fit the distribution of degradation and the reliability is calculated for $100 \\sim 1000$ temperature cycles. A theoretical basis is provided for the application of copper wire bonding in the field of high reliability. The method proposed in this paper can also provide a reference for the reliability assessment of other materials bonding wires."

This paper delves into machine learning (ML) methods suitable for predicting the likelihood of heart disease at an early stage, using publicly available datasets like the UCI Heart Disease dataset. The researchers used various ML algorithms, which were logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, to test predictive and classification capability. By using feature engineering and optimization methods the most significant factors leading to the development of heart disease were pinpointed such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and age. The experimental results prove that advanced ML models can attain a high level of accuracy, precision, and recall in predicting heart disease, thus exceeding traditional diagnostic methods. The conclusion emerged that timely intervention and personalized treatment plans could become possible via the integration of ML-driven predictive analytics into clinical workflows. This research presents a reliable structure for implementing ML models in healthcare applications with an accent on their contribution to improving cardiovascular diseases' early detection as well as preventive care strategies."

    "abstract": "Characterizing biomechanics in para-snowboarding is a significant hurdle. Overcoming it, however, could be a valuable tool for athletes, coaches, and prosthetists in adapting and adjusting prostheses, as well as greatly aiding in prosthesis design. The goal of this study is to better understand the various limitations faced by transfemoral (TF) individuals during training sessions on the slopes. Lower limb kinematic data were collected using eight IMUs on seven TF participants. Five participants were regular and three were goofy. An investigation into movement patterns was conducted, focusing on a complete cycle that included a backside (BS) turn immediately followed by a frontside (FS) turn. During this analysis, flexion/extension (F/E) angles were specifically measured at both the ankle and knee joints. During frontside (FS) turns, limitations arise at the prosthetic knee and ankle, as neither of these prosthetic components flex during this phase. Thus, the range of motion (ROM) of the prosthetic ankle ranges from 4.3° to 14.9° depending on the participant, while it ranges from 15.8° to 47.7° for the contralateral ankle. At the knee, the ROM ranges from 21.9° to 40.4° for the prosthetic side and ranges from 25.9° to 34.1° for the contralateral side. The sound limb compensates for this lack of mobility throughout the entire cycle, leading to random and asymmetric kinematic patterns. This initial study describes the kinematics of snowboarding in transfemoral amputees under ecological conditions, a topic that warrants further investigation."

    "abstract": "Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices demand cryptographic solutions that balance robust security with extreme resource efficiency, given strict constraints on power, memory, and processing. This study presents a detailed empirical evaluation of ten cryptographic algorithms—including symmetric ciphers and hash functions —across two representative microcontroller platforms: TM4C123GXL (ARM Cortex-M4F) and PIC32MX440F256H (MIPS32). Algorithms tested include AES-256-ECB, Tiny-AES (AES-128), XTEA, ChaCha20, Poly1305, NORX, HMAC, SHA-256, AEAD (AES-256-EAX), and Ascon-AEAD.Comprehensive measurements of energy, execution time, and memory footprint reveal substantial discrepancies between prior classifications and practical performance. Lightweight algorithms such as ChaCha20 and Ascon-AEAD consistently achieved superior energy and speed efficiency, while certain “lightweight” candidates like Poly1305 and Tiny-AES demonstrated higher resource demands. The study introduces a performance-based reclassification of cryptographic algorithms grounded in empirical results. It also evaluates end-to-end session behavior by integrating ECDH key exchange with ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption in a real-world IoMT setup. Results confirm the viability of these algorithms in real-time telemetry pipelines and battery-sensitive wearables. The findings offer hardware-aware, use-case-driven guidelines for cryptographic algorithm selection in secure and sustainable IoMT systems aligned with emerging NIST standards."

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables secure computation on encrypted data, making privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) viable for sensitive applications. Non-linear activation functions (AFs) such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh remain costly, as traditional polynomial approximations incur deep circuits and long runtimes. We propose a GPU-accelerated method that approximates these activations using fast piecewise-linear functions, formulated as a sign-decision problem to simplify computation and reduce circuit complexity. Compared to existing methods, our technique achieves a lower mean squared error (MSE) to the true activation functions, reducing MSE by approximately $55 \\%$ with an error below $10^{-2}$. Experiments demonstrate speedups of up to $128 \\times$ on MNIST and $840 \\times$ on CIFAR-10, with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Across various neural architectures and datasets, our pipeline significantly reduces homomorphic evaluation time and circuit depth compared to polynomial approximations of similar accuracy."

    "abstract": "Wearable accelerometers are widely used for continuous monitoring of physical activity. Supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms have long been used to extract meaningful activity information from raw accelerometry data, but progress has been hampered by the limited amount of labeled data that is publicly available. Exploiting large unlabeled datasets using self-supervised pretraining is a relatively new and underexplored approach in the field of human activity recognition (HAR).We used a time-series transformer masked autoencoder (MAE) approach to self-supervised pretraining and propose two novel spectrogram-based loss functions: the log-scale mean-magnitude (LMM) and log-scale magnitude variance (LMV) losses. We compared these losses with the mean squared error (MSE) loss for MAE training. We leveraged the large unlabeled UK Biobank accelerometry dataset (n = 109k) for pretraining and evaluated downstream HAR performance using a linear classifier in a smaller labelled dataset.We found that pretraining with the LMM loss improved performance compared to an MAE pretrained with the MSE loss, with 12.7% increase in subject-wise F1 score when using linear probing. Compared with a state-of-the-art ResNet-based HAR model, our LMM-pretrained transformer models performed better (+9.8% F1) with linear probing and comparably when fine-tuned using an LSTM classifier. The addition of the LMV to the LMM loss decreased performance compared to the LMM loss alone. These findings establish the LMM loss as a robust and effective method for pretraining MAE models on accelerometer data for HAR and show the potential of pretraining sequence-based models for free-living HAR.Clinical Relevance— Improved algorithms for human activity recognition, enables more accurate monitoring of physical activity, which is crucial for assessing mobility, rehabilitation progress, and chronic disease management."

    "abstract": "LLC converters operating across wide input voltage ranges tend to deviate from their optimal efficiency point, leading to a decline in overall performance. The flying capacitor based isolated resonant converter (FCiRC) with its frequency multiplication capability, is a viable candidate for high power density converter design. It offers a high step-down conversion from 800 V input to 48 V regulated output. Nevertheless, limiting its boundaries, the existing modulation scheme does not allow for a wide-input range operation. Addressing this shortcoming, the current work proposes three additional modulation strategies allowing the converter to operate under a wide input voltage ranging from 160 V to 960 V, delivering a regulated 48 V output. The converter maintains a stable efficiency of approximately 91 % across all modulation strategies, while preserving its key benefits-such as simplified magnetic design despite wide frequency variations across modes, and lower voltage stress on the switches. Experimental validation of the proposed modulation strategy has been presented."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reconfigurable and energy-efficient digital spectrum shaping signaling (DSSS) for multidrop interfaces, where the output spectrum of the transmitted data is shaped using the 2-times repetitive block transmission to avoid frequency notches in the multidrop channel, thereby achieving a data rate up to 4× the first channel notch frequency. In conventional wireline transceivers (TRX), compensating for frequency notches requires a large number of decision feedback equalizer (DFE) taps at the receiver, resulting in significant area and power overhead. In contrast, the proposed DSSS architecture supports spectrum-efficient reconfigurable dual-mode NRZ/PAM-4, reducing required equalization efforts and improving energy efficiency. The proposed scheme and its transmitter (TX) were first validated through event-driven behavioral simulations using XMODEL and verified with equipment-based measurements. Post-layout simulation results in 28 nm CMOS process demonstrated 4 Gb/s data rate communicating over a channel having its first > 30 dB notch at 1 GHz, with a 235 mV vertical eye opening and a TX energy efficiency of 0.39 pJ/b at 0.8 V supply."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Screening programs can benefit from Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems that detect and classify lung nodules using Computed Tomography (CT) scans. A great proportion of the literature proposes deep learning models based on single and private datasets with no evaluation of their generalisation capability. The main goal of this work is to study and address the lack of generalisation to out-of-domain data (source domain different from the target domain). In this work, we propose using a ResNet architecture with 2.5D inputs capable of maintaining the spatial information of the nodules (3 input channels based on the anatomical planes). Secondly, we apply domain-specific data augmentation tailored for CT scans. Combined with data augmentation, using 2.5D inputs achieves the best results, both in in-domain data (LIDC-IDRI: N=1377 nodules; and LNDb: N=183 nodules) and in out-of-domain data (LUNGx: N=73 nodules). In in-domain data, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.914 was achieved in the internal test set and 0.746 in one of the external test sets. Notably, in out-of-domain data, where the ground-truth labels have been confirmed by biopsy, whereas the training data only involved radiologist annotation regarding the \"likelihood of malignancy\", AUC improves from 0.576 to 0.695, reaching a performance close to that of radiology experts. In the future, strategies should be applied to deal with the level of uncertainty of lung nodule annotations based solely on the observation of the CT scans.Clinical relevance— This work provides an automatic method for lung nodule malignancy classification based on CT scans, combined with generalisation methods that allow a good performance across different cohort populations and hospitals."

More intuitive control is needed, but innovation is difficult without a valid and reliable way to measure intuitiveness. Here, we validate a secondary detection-response task (DRT) as a method to objectively measure the cognitive load of using a prosthesis. The DRT is a simple, yet sensitive measure of cognitive resource allocation based on response rate and reaction time to vibratory stimuli. Participants completed a primary task involving moving objects with varying fragility over a barrier without breaking them with their intact hand and with a prosthetic hand controlled by electromyography. While completing the primary task, participants also completed the secondary DRT in which they responded to randomly delivered vibratory stimuli as quickly as possible by pushing a button with their contralateral limb. Participants also completed the NASA Task Load Index, a survey commonly used to assess subjective workload. Results showed that response time and rate were reliable indicators of cognitive load, suggesting that the DRT can objectively measure cognitive load in prosthesis use, thereby guiding future innovation for more intuitive prosthetic control.Clinical Relevance— This research establishes the use of a secondary detection response task as a valid and reliable assessment of cognitive load during prosthesis use."

    "abstract": "When robotic systems are operated in unstructured environments, they often rely on combining depth cameras and tactile sensors to achieve reliable contact with objects of diverse geometries, typically requiring precise alignment with planar surfaces. However, with traditional 3D point cloud filtering and planar clustering methods, extensive manual tuning of abstract mathematical parameters may be necessary, which are often unintuitive and disconnected from the physical properties of sensing hardware. To address this, this paper introduces a novel point cloud processing framework that directly integrates the physical characteristics of capacitive tactile sensors—specifically their spatial resolution and sensor area—into the filtering and planar segmentation stages. By aligning algorithmic parameters with sensor capabilities, the proposed method achieves physically interpretable parameterization, facilitating effective adaptation to real-world scenarios. In the filtering stage, the original object point cloud is processed using thresholds based on the sensor’s resolution, with geometric structure retention levels, such as edges and protrusions determined by user-specified roughness tolerance. Compared to voxel-based filtering methods, this approach effectively eliminates surface artifacts while significant geometric features are preserved. The clustering stage employs a sliding-window mechanism analogous to convolutional kernels, with both window size and flatness thresholds defined by the sensor’s coverage area and the acceptable surface roughness specified by the user. Experiments using a UR5 robotic arm equipped with capacitive tactile sensors of different resolutions demonstrate that the proposed framework robustly achieves precise surface alignment and generalizes effectively across different sensor types by simply adjusting parameters according to sensor specifications. This approach significantly reduces parameter tuning complexity, offering a physically grounded, low-overhead solution for geometry-aware robotic perception."

    "abstract": "Autonomous inspection of maritime vessels using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can prove difficult due to low light conditions, minimum space and battery limitations. This paper proposes a strategy for optimized manhole traversal in the scenario of maritime vessel ballast tank inspection. A dense point cloud, collected during the exploration of the ballast tank, is used to localize the manhole that the UAV has to traverse through. The prediction of the manhole is performed on synthesized 360° panoramic views of the point cloud, originating from positions inside the mapped area. This manhole prediction enables a Model Predictive Control framework to find the optimal path through the manhole, taking into account the capabilities of the UAV and the topological constraints of the confined space. The manhole localization method is able to predict the center of the manhole with an average success rate of $89.6 \\%$, which can be raised to $94 \\%$ after the ensembling of multiple predictions from different assumed camera positions. Simulated results show the robustness of the Model Predictive Control method in a wide array of different scenarios. We demonstrate the ability of the method to predict accurately the manhole and efficiently pass through it using a UAV, in a real-world experimental setup."

This work performs a comparison between SDDP, Nested Decomposition (ND), and Deterministic Dual Dynamic Programming (DDDP), evaluating energy efficiency, computational scalability, and profitability. Simulation results indicate that SDDP improves profitability by 21.44% over DDDP nearly matching ND's performance (which is significantly more computationally intensive and intractable for large size instances). Despite a small gap, SDDP stands out for its robustness and computational efficiency in large-scale instances.

We conducted ablation studies using three open datasets to assess the model's effectiveness across different disease prediction tasks. Our ablation study examines the impact of removing components such as the Transformer's auxiliary layers, residual connections, and VIB, evaluating their roles in model convergence and generalization. Results indicate that integrating VIB enhances predictive accuracy and stabilizes learning by filtering noise and retaining essential features, while the Transformer's attention mechanisms quicken convergence. The HB framework, particularly with the inclusion of Add & Norm components, demonstrates improved stability and robustness, particularly in noisy datasets.

The activated sludge process, commonly used in biological treatment, is sensitive to parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and microbial concentration. These variables are nonlinear, non-stationary, and autocorrelated, making accurate prediction and control challenging for soft sensor development. This study introduces an enhanced hybrid model for predicting wastewater quality, integrating Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression with a moving time window technique to forecast Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and DO levels in aeration tanks. The model leverages state-space models with Kalman filtering to generate autoregressive time-series predictions, which serve as additional features to improve forecasting accuracy. Following validation with real-world wastewater treatment data, the model showed a significant reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with COD prediction accuracy improving by 46.5% and DO by 32.0% after incorporating time-series features. Additionally, the model's interpretability allows for detailed analysis of feature contributions, enabling operators to optimize operational parameters and reduce energy consumption, particularly in energy-intensive aeration systems. The feature selection process further enhanced performance, with the final models (Model 4) showing an additional improvement of up to 16.2% for COD and 8.8% for DO. This novel approach offers a practical and efficient solution for optimizing wastewater treatment processes, with the potential for real-time applications that enhance operational efficiency and sustainability."

To ensure both grid stability and support under limited overcurrent capability, it is necessary to quickly identify the fault type and fault location and then accordingly adjust the output power of IBRs. Considering single-line-to-ground (SLG) faults are most likely to occur among various transmission line faults, this paper aims to accurately and quickly predict the fault location and fault resistance in the transmission line for the PLL-synchronized IBRs.

This paper presents a comparative study of two widely used NTN propagation models: the ETSI Rician fading model and the ITU-R P. 681 land mobile-satellite model. Using MATLAB simulations of the NB-IoT NPDSCH link in a LEO 1200 km scenario, we evaluate block error rate (BLER) performance across elevation angles from 0° to 90° with varying numbers of repetitions. Results demonstrate that the ETSI Rician model, while simple and analytically tractable, produces overly optimistic BLER predictions at low elevations. In contrast, the ITU-R P. 681 model proved to be more versatile and capable of capturing diverse propagation environments. These findings highlight the importance of model selection for NTN design, particularly in low-elevation and urban scenarios."

    "abstract": "Impedance-based modeling methods are gaining increasing attention in practical electrical systems due to their black-box nature. By applying small-signal perturbations across frequencies of interest, impedance—defined as the ratio between excitation and steady-state response at the same frequency—offers a compact frequency-domain representation of system behavior. This paper generalizes the impedance definition from balanced to unbalanced electric machines, with a focus on isolating the machine's intrinsic multi-input multi-output (MIMO) response, referred to as the un-terminated terminal behavior model (TBM). For balanced three-phase operation, the machine is linearized around a steady-state operating point in the rotating dq reference frame, resulting in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The corresponding impedance extraction procedures based on controlled frequency sweeping are reviewed and experimentally validated. Under unbalanced conditions, however, the machine exhibits linear time-periodic (LTP) behavior after coordinate transformation, rendering conventional impedance definitions inadequate. To address this, the impedance concept is extended using harmonic state-space (HSS) modeling to account for cross-frequency coupling, forming a generalized harmonic impedance matrix (HIM) for LTP systems. In the simulation environment, the analytically derived harmonic transfer functions are used to construct the HIM, which is then applied to known perturbation inputs to predict the system's output. The resulting responses show strong agreement with those obtained from full time-domain simulations, thereby validating the forward mapping capability of the HIM in capturing cross-frequency interactions. The specific challenges of HIM extraction under unbalanced conditions are also analyzed, with particular attention to the time-dependence of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window. Additional practical considerations, such as harmonic contamination and excitation signal design, are discussed, along with directions for future experimental implementation."

    "abstract": "Thin-film electrode arrays play an important role when large integration densities of stimulating or recording channels are required in neural interfaces. To fabricate such ultra-light-weighted and flexible implantable neural electrodes, polyimide (PI) has been used successfully as substrate and insulation material. Advantages are that PI can be processed in a standard cleanroom facility, its high chemical resistance and low moisture uptake. The disadvantage is that it allows the PI surface to come in contact with various contaminants from the photolithography steps as well as desorbed impurities from process chambers. This can lead to delamination of the PI to subsequent deposited layers. In this study, PI film surfaces were treated with oxygen (O<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>) plasma in reactive ion etching (RIE) and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chambers to remove residues and activate the surface by functional groups.

While existing FHE accelerators focus on improving computational efficiency, they are often limited by the insufficient memory bandwidth and inefficient data transfer schemes, leading to significant bottlenecks, especially for processing large amounts of data. In this work, we evaluate whether OptoLink, a photonic interconnect architecture, is scalable and capable of providing high bandwidth to overcome these limitations. Leveraging Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) with Space Division Multiplexing (SDM), OptoLink achieves an impressive bandwidth of 1.6 TB/s over 128 channels—a 300x improvement over traditional electronic network. Additionally, its ability to efficiently broadcast data and support parallel processing further enhances performance. The broadcasting capability not only enables parallelism but also reduces power consumption in earlier NTT stages, improving overall energy efficiency. With its improved data throughput, scalability, and lower latency, OptoLink offers a robust solution capable of satisfying the high data transfer and memory demands of current FHE accelerators."

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is critical for effective clinical intervention. However, traditional diagnostic methods heavily rely on subjective assessments, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown great promise in MDD research due to its stability and interpretability. Nevertheless, automatic classification remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of MDD and the complex structural characteristics of the brain. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion network for multi-center MDD classification with T1-weighted MRI. This model separately extracts gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) features with 3D re-parameterized Vision Transformer (3D RepViT), and fuses multi-scale structural information of GM and WM via the 3D hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion (3D HMSFF) module. The 3D RepViT combines CNN-based local feature extraction with Transformer-based global modeling, while re-parameterization improves computational efficiency. The 3D HMSFF module extracts and fuses hierarchical multi-scale features across four stages. Experimental results on the multi-center, large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, comprising 2,226 subjects, demonstrate that our method achieves an overall accuracy of 74.89%, a sensitivity of 0.7850, a specificity of 0.7077, and an AUC of 0.8525, outperforming existing methods. These results suggest that our method may serve as an efficient and generalizable solution for automatic MDD classification, with potential clinical applicability.Clinical Relevance—This study proposes an automated MDD classification model using T1-weighted MRI, validated on a multi-center, large-scale dataset (REST-META-MDD) with 2,226 subjects.

This work aims to reframe existing cardiopulmonary models into a general finite-dimensional nonlinear time-invariant (FDNTI) framework to capture respiration–cardiovascular interactions. A MATLAB Simulink-based implementation is presented and a simulation study is carried out. By exploiting control theory formalism, a system theoretic oriented model is obtained, which addresses roles of state variables, inputs, and linear/nonlinear contributions. Simulation tests confirmed the validity of the proposed modeling approach.

Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI) technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules-achieves a record 45% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance characteristics are experimentally verified."

This study explores the use of machine learning techniques to enhance vancomycin trough level prediction, leveraging clinical datasets from the Nippon Medical School, Japan and the open data set MIMIC databases. Three predictive models—Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost—were evaluated based on their mean absolute error (MAE) and feature importance derived from SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis. A feature selection approach was implemented to identify key predictors, including creatinine clearance (Ccr), hemoglobin (Hgb), AST, and last-dose timing. Experimental results demonstrate that LightGBM achieved the highest predictive accuracy, outperforming the conventional Bayesian method and providing a robust alternative for individualized dosing."

Companies in all industries are integrating sustainable development as an integrative approach to current requirements and needs, which will actively facilitate the possibility for future generations to develop at least at the same level as today. The transition to sustainable development of companies can only be achieved through a performance-based approach to sustainability. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the models for assessing corporate sustainability. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to improve the process of assessing and analyzing corporate sustainability. In order to identify these methods of assessing sustainability, a systematic review of the literature will be conducted, in which the most effective methods for assessing corporate sustainability will be identified and presented.

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer interface (BCI), which translates neural activities into commands for external devices, holds significant promise for clinical rehabilitation and assisted movement for individuals with motor disabilities. Among various BCI paradigms, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based BCI garnered considerable attention due to its relatively stable and high-speed communication capabilities. However, a notable portion of the population, referred to as BCI illiteracy, struggles to effectively control BCI systems due to their inability to generate or modulate the neural patterns required for interaction. To address this issue, we proposed a user-centered approach using neurofeedback training (NFT) to improve individual’s performance on SSVEP-BCI. As a result, after a five-day training period, significant improvements in SSVEP-BCI performance were only observed in the training group rather than the control group without training. Notably, some subjects initially determined as BCI-illiterate also gained effective control of the BCI system after training. Further analysis revealed that the improvement of SSVEP-BCI performance had a close link with increased power and inter-trial phase coherence of the SSVEP response, indicating that NFT successfully strengthened the user’s task-related neural responses. These findings highlight the potential of NFT as a user-centered intervention to improve BCI control performance, offering a promising pathway to address BCI illiteracy and promote the broader application of BCI systems.Clinical Relevance— This study proposes an effective approach to enhancing the controllability of SSVEP-BCI systems, addressing the critical issue of individual control limitations.

Classical imaging methods in TDLAS tomography follow a two-stage approach, i.e., reconstructions of absorbance at two transitions and two-line thermometry for imaging of temperature and gas molar concentration. However, the separation of two stages lead to neglect of the physical constraint among these four variables, absorbance at two transitions, temperature and gas molar concentration, which leads to significant error propagation. An imaging model is proposed to mitigate the issue. In this model, a mapping from temperature and gas molar concentration to absorbance at two transitions is pre-established and incorporated into the reconstruction as constraint. An optimization objective is constructed with projection constraint, mapping induced constraint and local smoothness priors. The four variables are jointly reconstructed in iteration. Numerical simulations and comparison to the typical SART with two-line thermometry method were conducted. In noise-free cases, the proposed method achieved lower image errors, with average reductions of 0.068 in temperature and 0.182 in gas molar concentration. In noisy cases, average image error decreases of 0.064 in temperature and 0.163 in gas molar concentration were yielded by the proposed method across all SNR levels. These demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces image errors and artifacts, improves reconstruction accuracy, and enhances robustness to noise."

The resulting nanoVolt-level, periodic pulsed signals are often buried in extreme noise levels, making traditional filtering and demodulation methods ineffective. This paper examines the feasibility and limitations of using lock-in demodulation to detect these signals in environments with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). While lock-in demodulation is traditionally designed to operate on continuous sinusoidal waveforms, its application and effectiveness to demodulate short and exponentially decaying pulsed signals has not been previously investigated. The paper presents a discrete model of a lock-in demodulation scheme and verifies it experimentally with ultrasound pulses measured in a phantom tissue and fed to a commercially available lock-in amplifier. The model is then used in a series of simulations to investigate the influence of model and signal parameters, such as filter order, cut-off frequency, pulse width, and SNR, on the demodulation scheme’s output. The results indicate that wider wavelets and higher-order filters with a narrow band allow for better noise rejection. The results can guide the design and use of lock-in demodulation schemes for pulsed ultrasonic signals and ultimately offer a more robust alternative to traditional demodulation methods used in AET."

Specifically, we introduce a rhythm encoder inspired by neural oscillatory mechanisms to extract rhythm-specific information, combined with a pointwise convolutional structure to capture rhythm coupling features. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid-loss classifier that leverages supervised contrastive learning to strengthen rhythm coupling features and utilize cross-entropy loss for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that RSCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy and kappa coefficient. Notably, RSCNet achieves a 3.86% improvement in classification accuracy over existing methods in multi-class tasks."

The technique is applied to high-performance combined-excitation synchronous electric motors which exhibit highly nonlinear characteristics, making performance scaling challenging. The proposed approach employs an ML meta-model trained on data obtained from finite element analysis (FEA), utilizing an experimentally validated model for nonlinear scaling and performance prediction at different power ratings. The accuracy of the meta-model in capturing the nonlinear relationships between design parameters and motor performance is first assessed using metrics such as R-squared (R2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) prior to nonlinear scaling. The scaled results are then compared with those obtained from finite element analysis (FEA), demonstrating good correlation within acceptable tolerances.

Power converters used in automotive traction applications undergo a thermo-mechanical mission profile that results in packaging degradation which is manifested as an increase in the thermal impedance of the package due to die-attach delamination, solder voiding and/or base-plate degradation. It is customary to consider a module with 20% higher thermal impedance as no longer useable due to reduced energy conversion efficiency from higher junction temperatures. However, these converters may still be capable of service under de-rated conditions. This paper proposes a method through which 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup> life usability can be assessed."

    "abstract": "Precise classification of megakaryocytes is crucial for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes. Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Accurately locating object instances and generating precise segmentation masks remains a major challenge in complex, real-world environments due to occlusions, cluttered scenes, and scale variations. In this work, we propose FRISNET, a fast and real-time instance segmentation network that effectively fuses frequency-domain and spatial-domain representations to enhance both semantic understanding and spatial precision. Building upon the YOLACT framework-the current speed benchmark in singlestage instance segmentation-we incorporate a 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based module to extract and isolate low- and high-frequency components from feature maps. These frequency-domain features are then reintegrated with spatialdomain representations to capture both global context and finegrained details. Additionally, we enhance the standard Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) by introducing a novel bottom-up pathway and same-level skip connections, which reinforce multi-scale feature representation and preserve high-resolution spatial information. FRISNET is trained and evaluated on two widely used benchmarks: PASCAL Segmentation Boundary Detection (PASCAL SBD) and Microsoft COCO. Experimental results demonstrate that FRISNET achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 34.5 at 31.8 FPS on MS COCO, outperforming YOLACT++ with a ResNet-50 backbone by $1.17 \\% \\mathrm{mAP}$. Its superior accuracy-speed trade-off makes FRISNET particularly suitable for time-critical applications, such as robotic motion planning and tactile-sensor-assisted object grasping in unstructured environments."

    "abstract": "Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) is a congenital or developmental case where the hip joint does not form correctly causing misalignment between the femoral head and the acetabulum. Early diagnosis via X-ray imaging utilizing digital radiography detection systems has an important role for DDH diagnosis and prevents complications or mobility issues and according to 2024 statistics of registered disabled people at Nineveh Center for Rehabilitation of Disabled 1582 cases of complications and 285 mobility issues resulted from misdiagnosis and delay diagnosis of DDH. This manuscript introduces a new approach for detecting DDH from X-ray images by integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with traditional image processing techniques to get superior classification performance. Radiography images are processed to get high-quality image resizing, reduce noise, enhance brightness and contrast, enhance edges while keeping fine details and making noise low by adaptive adjusting and eliminate artifact elements. These preprocessing steps improve feature extraction for CNN analysis and image classification. A real pelvic dataset comprising 2824 cases, which plays an important role in the classification of DDH, are used from hospitals in Mosul. The dataset contains two classes (DDH and normal) of images derived from digital radiography detection systems for different patients of varying genders and ages from six months to eight years. DDH Diagnosis using a Convolutional Neural Network (DDHCNN) combined with traditional image processing techniques to create hybrid model which obtain an exceptional accuracy of 99.88%, outperforming the DDHCNN model which has 98.58% accuracy without image processing. So the enhanced accuracy highlights the critical role of image enhancement in improving diagnostic reliability. Although there were challenges in collecting a real dataset for DDH but this hybrid model is a great step toward establishing an enhanced DDH detection paving the way for improved healthcare interventions, sustainable healthcare principles and telemedicine applications."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Stage-Calibrated Multiscale Temporal dependency-based Transfer Learning (SCMTTL) model to predict the RUL of energy systems with varying operating conditions. The SCMTTL model captures both short-term and long-term dependencies of monitoring data while effectively integrating system degradation stage information to enhance RUL prediction accuracy."

To validate this approach, we classified surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from 10 subjects in the Ninapro DB5 dataset performing six distinct movements. We compared the classification accuracy of the proposed method with three baseline approaches: CNN, CNN with a multi-head attention mechanism, and CNN-LSTM with a multi-head attention mechanism. These methods were evaluated under five experimental scenarios: (1) no electrode shifting, (2) electrode shifting, (3) electrode shifting with data augmentation, (4) electrode shifting with fine-tuning, and (5) electrode shifting with both data augmentation and fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "In recent times, single-cell analysis from time-lapse imaging has been used to characterize distinct subpopulations of a complex heterogeneous cell system. This can offer significant insights leading to robust cancer treatment strategies. In particular, calcium imaging may have significance since the pattern in oscillation may encode the cell state. Although model fitting to single-cell dynamics is pivotal, the analysis remains time consuming due to manual segmentation from time-lapse microscopic images. Secondly, the parameter estimation for the nonlinear system of differential equations (ODEs) describing these oscillations remains challenging due to the massive search space and the presence of multiple local minima in the objective function. To address these problems,firstly, we propose a computer vision algorithm (YOLOv9) to automatically extract calcium signals from the live cell imaging video dataset. Next, we implemented a two-step approach that combines Monte Carlo simulations (MC) and Genetic algorithm (GA) for parameter estimation. The first step (MC), was used to narrow down the search space and find the best performing upper and lower bounds for GA. In the second step, we implemented GA to determine the optimized parameters for the nonlinear model. Monte Carlo sampling along with GA shows significant reduction in KL divergence compared to only GA. We have also presented multiple simulations for the stochastic version of the model using the estimated parameters. The proposed pipeline shows significant promise for understanding the underlying cell states."

    "abstract": "The efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) power plants is critically influenced by power losses occurring during energy conversion and transmission, particularly within alternating current (AC) components. This study addresses the challenge of quantifying and minimizing these losses by focusing on PV system configurations that utilize inverters with an output voltage of 0.8 kV—a relatively high level for low-voltage applications. The primary objective is to analyze the distribution of active and reactive power losses across key AC elements, including low-voltage cables, medium-voltage cables, and transformers, and to evaluate the impact of inverter voltage on overall system performance. Through analytical modeling and simulation under varying operational scenarios, the research demonstrates that systems operating at 0.8 kV and unity power factor achieve the lowest total active power losses across internal AC components and grid connection lines. Although external line losses slightly increase due to higher grid injection levels, the total system losses are significantly lower than those observed in conventional 0.4 kV configurations—resulting in a reduction of 53.79 kW in active losses and approximately 13 kVAr in reactive losses at full capacity for a 2.2 MW installation. Structural analysis reveals that internal losses are predominantly concentrated in low-voltage cable lines 65-68%, followed by transformers (29-31%) and internal 10 kV cabling (3-4%)."

NVC can be evaluated noninvasively via the simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and mean cerebral blood velocity (MCBv) monitored via transcranial Doppler (TCD) device. We propose an approach for NVC estimation grounded on the assessment of the cross-correlation at zero lag between the beat-to-beat variability series of MCBv and EEG power assessed over typical frequency bands utilized in EEG analysis, namely δ, θ, α and β bands. A surrogate data approach was applied to test the null hypothesis of the absence of NVC. This methodology was tested in 20 right-handed healthy volunteers (9 males, 11 females; age: 31±4 yrs) in which MCBv was monitored via TCD device along with a 19-channel EEG. Recordings were performed at rest in supine position (REST) and during active standing (STAND). We found that the strength of NVC varies with frequency band, experimental condition and brain region. More specifically, NVC strength was significant at REST especially in the δ and α bands and in the occipital and parietal regions, while it was much weaker during STAND, especially in those brain areas where NVC was particularly strong at REST. This novel approach to the NVC characterization highlights the complexity of the interactions between cerebral vasomotion and brain activity even in absence of a definite cognitive task."

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in myoelectric control of upper-limb prostheses, their use remains challenging and the rejection rates are still high. One step towards improving the human-prosthesis interfacing is to implement artificial sensory feedback as this can improve performance and user experience. While some late-generation prostheses incorporate supplementary feedback, there is still a lack of a principled method to investigate the impact of feedback and evaluate its effectiveness. In this study, we focused on how the subjects learn to operate an upper-limb prosthesis to control the grip force in a grasping task under visual control. We manipulated target grip force, and sensory and motor noise and investigated how these factors affected control performance. To interpret the empirical findings, we developed a computational model in which learning is described as the gradual acquisition of an internal representation of the prosthesis transfer function. The experimental data were collected in 20 non-disabled subjects and the results showed that the precision of control decreased with the increase in the target force and the level of motor noise, whereas the sensory noise did not have a significant impact. The model qualitatively reproduced the main experimental findings, in particular the dependence of performance on motor noise magnitude. The developed model is the first promising step towards capturing the behavior of prosthesis user and developing a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the different factors governing closed-loop prosthesis control."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer diagnosis using ultrasound imaging remains challenging due to noise, variability in lesion appearance, and several artifacts. To address these concerns, this study proposes WAveHCT, a Wavelet-Attentive Hybrid Convolution-Transformer Network that uses wavelet decomposition and a hybrid architecture to diagnose breast cancers in ultrasound images. The proposed approach begins by applying anisotropic diffusion filtering to the ultrasound images, effectively reducing noise while preserving edge details. A ResNet50-based encoder backbone is then used to extract features from the wavelet-decomposed and anisotropic diffusion-filtered images. These features are integrated using a novel Wavelet-Attentive Feature Fusion (WAFF) module, enabling improved diagnostic performance. Further, the study introduces a hybrid block with convolutional and transformer layers. The transformer layers effectively capture global dependencies, while convolution operations preserve local feature representations. WAveHCT demonstrated superior accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to existing methods. Heatmaps generated by WAveHCT exhibited improved localization of clinically relevant features, emphasizing its potential to assist radiologists in diagnosing breast cancers.Clinical relevance—Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, non-invasive and non-ionizing method of breast cancer screening. Therefore, developing advanced deeplearning-based tools for diagnosing breast cancer using ultrasound images can enhance radiologists’ efficiency and reduce unnecessary invasive biopsies."

    "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) manifests clinically through abnormal development of the retinal capillary, ischemia, proliferative retinopathy, and retinal detachment, making it one of the leading causes of childhood blindness. Diagnosis of ROP from images of the full retinal fundus is challenging due to the presence of small peripheral lesions and underdeveloped ocular structures in premature infants. Current methods for fundus image analysis, based on Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, often struggle to capture long-range dependencies or are limited by the complex computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose a CNN-Mamba interaction fusion network, CMIFNet, for diagnosing ROP. This network consists of a CNN-based branch for local feature extraction and a bidirectional state space model (BSSM) based branch for global information integration. We developed an interactive attention fusion module (IAFM) to enhance feature interaction and facilitate attention-based integration between the two branches. Our approach demonstrates promising recognition performance on a clinical ROP dataset."

    "abstract": "The acceptance of surgical assistance systems is highly dependent on their ability to dynamically adapt the level of assistance to the surgeon’s individual needs. The challenge is to assess the skill level across a variety of surgical tasks. Intra-operative stress measurement could present an opportunity for task-independent skill assessment, with the hypothesis that challenging situations lead to higher stress levels. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between physiological and subjective measures of stress and surgical performance in a simulator setting. To this end, we collected heart rate as well as mental load self-assessment data of ten participants during repetitive training sessions of a minimally-invasive surgery curriculum. We explore the training effects on stress levels across different time scales and show a clear relationship between experienced stress and surgical performance. Our results indicate that intra-operative stress assessment could play a key role in designing adaptive surgical assistance systems.Clinical relevance— Our research offers a new approach to allow assistance systems to adapt to the surgeon’s skill level. Thus, it holds the potential to increase the acceptance of these systems, ultimately leading to more reliable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the collected data provides valuable insights into the relationship between training progress, skill level and stress. This could function as a basis for more advanced surgical training tools"

This study integrates EEG and ECG signals with a VR-based serious game for exposure therapy, assessing neurophysiological engagement in a framework designed for real-time integration.

While ECG signals faced motion-related artifacts, EEG data reliably captured cognitive adaptation to repeated stimuli, reinforcing the feasibility of real-time neurofeedback. Despite these challenges, our study successfully validates the integration of multimodal biosignals in VR-based exposure therapy, confirming its potential for adaptive, personalized interventions.

In this study, we proposed a Text-to-ECG (T2ECG) framework, which could generate synthetic ECG beats from textual data. The framework made use of two components. The first, Bio_ClinicalBERT, produced an embedded vector from the input text (e.g., \"left ventricular hypertrophy\"). Then, a second component leveraged such representation to generate a 12-lead ECG heartbeat by means of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with gradient penalty. The training was performed on the PTB-XL dataset, freely available on Physionet. The framework was designed to generate five different diagnostic classes: i) normal sinus rhythm; ii) inferior myocardial infarction (IMI); iii) antero-septal myocardial infarction (ASMI); iv) left anterior fascicular block (LAFB); and v) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The realism of the generated signals was assessed through three different methodologies, involving both visual inspection and quantitative analyses. Our results show that the T2ECG framework was able to generate heartbeats of sufficient quality, except for the the ASMI class. In conclusion, the framework proposed does not only support data augmentation but also facilitates the creation of ECGs by non-technical users, offering a textual interface to the GenAI model."

    "abstract": "Dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve wireless charging for devices that move, like warehouse robots. Distinguished from the traditional stationary wireless power transfer, the couplings between the receiving (Rx) and transmitting (Tx) coils vary when the receiver moves in DWPT systems, which leads to voltage and current fluctuations on the Rx side. In this paper, the magnetic field reconfiguration (MFR) of the DWPT system is reported first. Namely, the position variation of the receiver changes the magnetic flux loop, which causes the self-inductance variation of Rx and Tx coils. This phenomenon will reduce the system's efficiency. In order to mitigate the impact of MFR, efficiency optimization strategies are proposed, and experiments are conducted to verify the analysis."

    "abstract": "With the recent popularization of online interviews, lack of communication has become an issue. By using VR technology, it is expected to duplicate an environment similar to a face-to-face interview and optimize the interview environment with psychological comfort in mind. In this study, we examined the effects of the number of interviewers and types of objects in a VR space on participants' interpersonal distance. In Experiment 1, cardboard, mannequin, and human avatars were presented and participants’ interpersonal distance was investigated. The results showed that participants tended to increase their interpersonal distance as the number of avatars increased. And there was no significant difference in distance between the different types of avatars. In Experiment 2, one to five interviewer objects were presented in a VR conference room to measure the interpersonal distance and psychological load level that participants considered appropriate. The results showed that there was no increase in appropriate distance whether there were one or two interviewers, and that the psychological load was lower with one interviewer than with two. The results suggest that one interviewer is appropriate for counseling, while two interviewers are appropriate for interview practice. This study suggested optimal values for the distance between the interviewer and the interviewee and the number of interviewees participating in the VR interview environment by measuring personal space while measuring the effect of the avatar and number of interviewees on the psychological load level of the participants.Clinical Relevance— Prolonged hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs) causes rehabilitation difficulties and communication barriers for patients. Creating a interactive rehabilitation environment using VR is expected to contribute to situations where patients with PTSD and trauma are provided with opportunities to gradually learn how to interact with others, as well as to situations where patients with stroke and physical disabilities are rehabilitated in spatial cognition. The distance between the interviewer and the interviewee during an interview affects the smoothness of communication. This study provided insight into the optimal distance between interviewer and interviewee in VR interviews, depending on the number of interviewees participating."

This study investigated the impact of tACS delivered at subject-specific peak MI frequencies on MI performance accuracy, quantified in terms of classification accuracy, and interhemispheric symmetry, measured via the brain symmetry index (BSI). Using a brain-computer-brain closed-loop system, each subject’s peak MI performance frequency was first identified during the Pre-stimulation phase, after which tACS was delivered at this determined frequency. Our findings show that active individualized tACS decreased MI performance and increased BSI, suggesting inhibitory effects on motor-related neural processes.Clinical Relevance— The observed inhibitory effects of tACS highlight its potential for targeted neuromodulation in stroke recovery. Future research should explore how inhibitory effects can be harnessed therapeutically and investigate stimulation parameters that could optimize outcomes for functional recovery. The demonstrated ability of tACS to modulate brain activity, evidenced by increased BSI, underscores its promise as a neuromodulatory tool in clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Databases play a critical role in many computing systems and applications and provide an excellent source of information for forensics investigations. Also, with many advances in the digital forensics field, several forensic tools can be employed for different purposes in digital investigations. Despite this, many forensics tools have limitations when it pertains to the collection, examination, or analysis of potential evidence from database management systems due to the inherent complexities of handling different database systems. This is particularly true for free or open-source tools that can be used for research purposes, and this limits the development of new tools and solutions for database forensics. To address this and forge a path for the development of new tools for database forensics, this paper highlights some of the available tools that can be used for database forensics, the limitations of using some of these tools, and the challenges of performing database analysis in general. We achieve this through a practical analysis of the tools and examine their capabilities in terms of supporting the forensics analysis of databases found on digital devices. Given their popularity, we consider databases found on both Android and iPhone devices, as well as other data sources. We integrated an analysis of relevant testing reports from the Computer Forensics Tool Testing (CFTT) program to provide a complete picture of the forensic tools. This paper establishes the aspects where these tools can be improved and provides recommendations for handling some of the challenges associated with the forensics analysis of database systems."

Traditionally, manual cell counting has been used to assess macrophage adhesion, a labor-intensive and subjective process. To address these limitations and enable unbiased analysis, we developed an automated in-situ system to quantify TAM attachment to antifouling polymer brushes. Bland-Altman analysis indicated a high agreement between our automated method and traditional manual cell counting. For M1 macrophages, the mean difference was less than 4 cells, with limits of agreement (LoA) ranging from -70.18% to 80.16%. For M2 macrophages, the mean difference was 25 cells, with LoA ranging from -51.61% to 72.71%. These results were consistent across different experimental conditions, including Unspecific Binding, Specific Antibody, and IgG Control. Our analysis revealed no systematic differences in cell counts and holds significant potential for point-of-care applications, potentially enhancing personalized treatment strategies.Clinical relevance— This approach could enhance personalized treatment strategies by providing real-time assessment of the tumor microenvironment through minimally invasive liquid biopsies."

The processing pipeline assumes regular grid division of breast tissue and characterization of each image patch by radiomics features for further binary classification using Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost to differentiate between suspicious lesions and fibro-glandular tissue. The patch-wise results obtained reveal F1 scores ≥ 0.92, with balanced precision (0.94) and recall (0.95) for different patch sizes. Reassembling patch decisions supports positioning of the identified suspicious breast regions and patient-level decision making.Clinical relevance— With high incidence rates of breast cancer, an automated detection of suspicious lesions in MRI breast scans can offer a valuable support in patient prioritization and clinical decision making, especially in settings with low reader availability."

    "abstract": "Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson’s disease that impairs mobility and safety by increasing the risk of falls. An effective FOG detection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living environments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection methods face challenges due to (1) intra-and inter-patient variability, (2) subject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations (e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive learning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative model refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system using a public Parkinson’s dataset collected in a free-living environment. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false positive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection, empowering preventive care and long-term symptom management as Parkinson’s progresses.

However,expert annotation of EEG signals is costly and time-intensive, limiting the scalability of deep learning models for brain-state classification. While active learning reduces annotation needs by prioritizing informative samples, it neglects unlabeled data; pseudo-labeling leverages unlabeled data but risks label noise. To address these limitations,we propose a hybrid framework integrating active learning with confidence-based pseudo-labeling. The framework operates iteratively through three key steps: 1) Uncertainty sampling selects high-value EEG epochs for expert annotation; 2) High-confidence pseudo-labels are generated for the remaining data; and 3) A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is trained on the combined dataset. The TCN architecture efficiently models EEG temporal dependencies. As a result, our framework significantly outperforms conventional approaches, achieving a 9.75% improvement in accuracy (91.83% vs. 82.08%) and a 24.12% boost in precision with 36% fewer expert-annotated samples.

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are largely responsible for maintaining vascular tone. Their ability to adapt to any local hemodynamic change is thus an integral mechanism of both cardiovascular function and systemic cardiovascular control. However, the exact processes driving smooth muscle cell contraction, and subsequent local and systemic level vascular tone adaptation, to hemodynamic changes are complex and not well understood. This leaves a gap in our understanding and ability to predict and manage cardiovascular disease progression. We aim to begin addressing this knowledge gap by coupling, in-silico, a detailed electro-chemo-mechanical smooth muscle model with a systemic level integrated cardiovascular model that includes a mechanoelectric heart generating the cardiovascular drive, and a detailed circulatory system including the coronary arteries. The system and cell level models are coupled through the flow and pressure profiles obtained from the systemic level driving the muscle force generation. The model behaviors are demonstrated for the cell level control of left main coronary artery in LVOT obstructive and non-obstructive cases for both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and non-HCM virtual patients. The pulsatile pressure and flow changes between the obstructive and non-obstructive cases are observed to alter the contractile force of the SMC through Nitric Oxide and stretch driven pathways. A marked difference in vascular tone between the obstructive and non-obstructive cases is observed. Most interestingly, an inverse force response to obstructive pressure and flow is observed in HCM cases. In this work we demonstrate a successful preliminary coupling of arterial smooth muscle cell cardiovascular and systemic level cardiovascular models."

    "abstract": "Short-circuit ruggedness remains a critical challenge in silicon carbide (SiC) power devices, where excessive hot-spot temperatures contribute to device degradation and failure. During a Type-I short circuit lasting several microseconds, the heat flux localized at the top surface of the SiC die cannot dissipate effectively through the substrate, rendering the die-bottom thermal capacitance ineffective. This work investigates increasing die-top thermal capacitance to absorb short-circuit heat flux and reduce hot-spot temperature. It examines both existing alternatives to aluminum metallization and newly proposed materials. State-of-the-art SiC packaging technologies have integrated advanced material solutions. However, existing literature has primarily focused on copper for die-top metallization and has not systematically investigated alternative materials for optimizing short-circuit thermal management. FEA simulation shows that copper/diamond composite is expected to reduce the hot-spot temperature by 35%-40%, outperforming alternative materials significantly. With that, an extension of short-circuit withstand time (SCWT) might be achieved, enabling higher ruggedness and reliability, simpler protection circuit design, and the pursuit of lower specific on-resistance. These findings support the feasibility of material-level thermal optimization as a pathway to improve device ruggedness and simplify protection circuit requirements."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the potential of a 24 GHz continuous-wave (CW) radar for non-contact monitoring of vital signs, including breathing, pulse, and heart sounds. Instantaneous rates extracted from estimated heart sounds and breathing signals showed strong agreement with the reference systems, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.46 beats/min and 0.57 breaths/min, respectively. Additionally, averaged heart rates obtained from radar-derived pulse signals had an MAE of 2.41 beats/min. Then, the analysis of breathing variability revealed that chest movement values are more widely distributed at lower breathing rates. The radar’s ability to detect fine chest displacements associated with vital signs highlights its increased suitability for continuous and unobtrusive cardiorespiratory health monitoring.Clinical relevance—Explore the capabilities and limitations of cardiorespiratory signals extracted from CW radar in healthy subjects to detect instantaneous rates accurately."

    "abstract": "Transorbital electrical stimulation (TES) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting visual percepts, or phosphenes, in both sighted and visually impaired individuals. However, the utility of these approaches is limited owing to cumbersome setups consisting of wired gel electrodes and the difficulty in optimizing stimulation paradigms. Overall, optimizing transorbital stimulation paradigms, remains a huge challenge, particularly regarding electrode type and waveform characteristics. In this study, we investigated whether the type of electrode (i.e. wet versus dry) affects the psychometric curve for phosphene detection. Our findings indicate that both electrode types yield comparable detection thresholds, suggesting that dry electrodes could offer a viable, practical alternative for TES without compromising efficacy, while dramatically enhancing usability. Building on this, we explored whether temporal interference (TI) stimulation, a technique leveraging high-frequency signals to create a low-frequency envelope at a targeted neural region, could enhance phosphene perception when optimized for the posterior retina. Our results demonstrate that TI stimulation significantly increases phosphene detection rates in sighted subjects, highlighting its potential to improve TES precision and effectiveness.Clinical relevanceThese findings have significant implications for the development of non-invasive neurostimulation technologies aimed at testing, restoring, or augmenting vision. The high performances of dry electrodes pave the way for more user-friendly, portable stimulation devices, reducing the reliance on cumbersome electrode preparations. Additionally, the enhancement of phosphene perception via TI suggests a pathway toward more selective, spatially targeted stimulation strategies, potentially refining TES for future clinical applications. Put together, these results contribute to the optimization of TES paradigms, bringing the technology closer to real-time, wearable neurostimulation solutions for visual rehabilitation and augmentation."

    "abstract": "The long-term goal of this research is to improve the functionality of non-invasive transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES) by improving specificity in upper extremity paralysis. Spinal cord injuries result in an estimated 10,000 new cases of upper extremity paralysis yearly. FES has been used extensively to assist and rehabilitate individuals with lower-limb paralysis, but it has not been widely adopted for upper-limb paralysis. This is in part due to the complex setup necessary to target the right combination of small muscles densely packed in the forearm to create a desired hand gesture. To address this challenge, here we introduce a new multichannel FES system that enables complex current steering with a high compliance voltage to selectively recruit small extrinsic hand muscles in isolation or in combination. Using this system with real-time motion capture data of the hand, we stimulated unique electrode configurations each second to rapidly identify a rich repertoire of hand gestures. Additionally, as an initial demonstration of the unique current steering capabilities, we show that FES involving three active electrodes, instead of the traditional 2-electrode setup, provides greater specificity and redundancy, which in turn could support more therapeutic motions and interleaved stimulation to reduce fatigue Thus, this work constitutes an important step towards more efficient, dexterous, and robust upper-limb FES to improve neurorehabilitation outcomes for people with spinal cord injuries.Clinical Relevance— A new multichannel FES system can rapidly configure FES stimulation to evoke a variety of single-digit and multi-digit hand gestures."

    "abstract": "There is currently a wide interest in developing wearable devices for the estimation of cuffless blood pressure (CBP) based on pulse transit time (PTT) measurements. However, to make the measurement more convenient for the user, many devices measure pulse arrival time (PAT), the time difference between the ECG and a distal pulse wave, typically in the hands, using, for example, photoplethysmography (PPG). The drawback of this procedure is that PAT includes not only PTT but also the pre-ejection period (PEP), which can limit the reliability of the measurements. On the other hand, the measurement of the PEP usually involves the placement of sensor elements on the torso by specialized operators, which greatly limits the measurement of this parameter outside of hospital settings. In this work, we present an unobtrusive method for the estimation of PEP using hand-to-hand impedance plethysmography (hh-IPG). To validate the feasibility of the presented approach, hh-IPG and reference impedance cardiography (ICG) signals were recorded sequentially for 2 min from 9 subjects with a wide age range. The results obtained show a strong correlation (R = 0.90) between the PEP estimate obtained with hh-IPG and the reference PEP obtained with ICG, which opens up the possibility of incorporating this measurement in a much more convenient and non-invasive way in wearable devices in the near future.Clinical Relevance— The hh-IPG method offers a non-invasive, stable, and user-friendly alternative to traditional impedance cardiography (ICG) for pre-ejection period (PEP) estimation. Its consistent performance with lower variability supports its application in wearable devices and telemedicine platforms."

This paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities encountered by start-ups in the field of renewable energy, starting from a qualitative analysis supported by a bibliometric one of the specialized literature and relevant public policies. The results of the analyses highlight a series of systemic obstacles in the order of unstable regulations, limited access to financing but also the lack of an efficient infrastructure, where at the same time a series of opportunities that we could consider significant were identified, such as those related to the fierce concern for the digitalization of industries but also accessing financing for green energies.

The proposed topology aims to achieve high power density and a compact layout to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). A comprehensive analysis is presented to address the circuit topology, switching patterns, and operating modes. Continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) are studied to develop a complete dynamic model and clarify the power transfer mechanism. Two control strategies, a mixed proportional-integral (PI) control and an inductor peak current control, are proposed to regulate the dual outputs in CCM and DCM conditions, respectively. It is shown that full decoupling of voltage control is achievable in DCM but limited in CCM due to inductor current sharing. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the converter's performance."

This paper presents the modeling and simulation of a regenerative braking system using MATLAB System Composer and Simulink. A system-level architecture is developed in System Composer to define functional components, interfaces, and data flows, while Simulink is employed for dynamic modeling and performance analysis. The integration of these tools facilitates a multi-domain representation, allowing seamless transition from architectural design to time-domain simulations. Various braking scenarios are simulated to evaluate system behavior, energy recovery efficiency, and interactions between mechanical and electrical subsystems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of regenerative braking in improving vehicle energy efficiency and highlight the advantages of a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach for design, validation, and optimization.

    "abstract": "When incorporating spatial priors (such as sparsity and low occurrence frequency) to identify anomalies, existing hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) methods typically operate on the original high-dimensional spectral bands or features obtained through dimensionality-reduction techniques. However, they often neglect the explicit modeling and exploitation of the internal discriminative structure inherent in bands, consequently diluting the discriminative spectral information crucial for effective anomaly-background separation. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when processing hyperspectral data, where the rich spectral heterogeneity could provide valuable discriminative cues for HAD. To address this issue, we propose a super-band quaternion-guided sparse network (SuperB-QSNet), which explicitly encodes the spectral discriminant structure while retaining the advantage of spatial sparse priorities. First, a heterogeneous-homogeneous super-band compression (HH-SBC) organizes spectral bands into meaningful hetero-groups. It naturally reduces redundancy and retains the representative spectral information. Second, the quaternionic sparse recovery (QSR) model encodes both spatial structures and intra-group spectral correlations via hypercomplex algebra, ensuring robust anomaly preservation and enhanced detection of spectral variations. Third, we design a differences-guided quaternionic convolution detector (DG-QCD) to maintain spectral coherence via group processing and enhance discriminative capability via inter-group difference operation. Extensive experiments show that SuperB-QSNet enhances anomaly detection accuracy while ensuring computational efficiency across real-world hyperspectral datasets."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) to exchange safety-related information over public wireless channels, thereby enhancing transportation system security and efficiency. However, malicious adversaries may impersonate RSUs to disseminate false information or masquerade as legitimate vehicles to gain unauthorized services. To counter such threats, mutual authentication between vehicles and RSUs is crucial. This task is particularly challenging due to the high mobility of vehicles and the resource constraints of both vehicles and RSUs. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Anonymous Authentication Scheme with Session Key Agreement (EA2S2KA), which leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to achieve lightweight, fast, and secure authentication. We conduct an informal security analysis, a formal security proof under the real-or-random (RoR) model, and formal security verification using AVISPA, all of which confirm that EA2S2KA resists a broad range of security threats in VANETs. Performance comparisons with recently proposed schemes show that EA2S2KA provides stronger security guarantees while achieving the lowest total computation cost and ranking among the top three in communication efficiency. Furthermore, NS-3 simulations confirm its practicality in large-scale and dynamic environments through evaluations of the authentication success rate, average authentication delay, and authentication message throughput."

The fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) is a valuable signal for estimating fetal heart rate and analyzing valuable clinical insights.

To address this, we propose a deep learning framework, termed Single-Channel Time Delay Network (SCTD-Net), for robust FECG extraction. The framework employs a sequential two-stage strategy: a 1D U-Net is first utilized to extract the MECG, and a time-delay method maps the 1D AECG and estimated MECG into 2D representations to better reflect the temporal pattern of the signals. A custom-designed 2D CNN, Ursa-Net, is then developed to extract the FECG from the 2D data. Ursa-Net comprises a 2D U-Net for suppressing maternal components, followed by a reconstruction block consisting of convolutional layers with batch normalization and downsampling, which reconstructs the FECG. In contrast to conventional deep learning methods that rely on 1D CNNs, SCTD-Net exploits the 2D structure of transformed signals for improved feature representation. The models are initially trained on synthetic data from the FECGSYNDB dataset and evaluated on real-world datasets (PCDB and ADFECGDB). Comparative analysis with traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning methods demonstrates that SCTD-Net achieves strong performance in terms of fetal QRS detection, particularly with high PPV of 98.8% and 97.94% on PCDB and ADFECGDB datasets, respectively. These findings suggest that SCTD-Net is a robust and efficient solution for long-term non-invasive monitoring of fetal cardiac health."

    "abstract": "Background: The use of point clouds to perform quality control (QC) of prefabricated structural systems is growing markedly. The sustained application of point clouds on construction projects at scale, however, requires reliable and automated frameworks to foster practicality. Literature Review: Existing solutions seldom incorporate the impact of instrument artifacts, construction errors, and complex element geometries, rendering the frameworks error-prone and sensitive to thresholds, outliers, and missing data. Current methods suffer from the following: (i) are not generalizable to any freeform element; (ii) rely on local primitives, which increases runtime and threshold subjectivity; (iii) do not formulate the point cloud to model fitting based on geometric distance; and (iv) do not incorporate a dedicated outlier detection to explicitly handle large outliers. Methodology: This study presents, scan-to-QC, a generic solution for automatic QC of prefabricated elements with non-analytic cross-sections using point clouds. The framework addresses the current state-or-the-art limitations (above) by providing a generic, direct artificial-intelligence (AI)-based geometrid distance fitting robust to outliers. The proposed approach introduces four new algorithms to: (i) represent the cross-sectional boundaries of elements with trigonometric polynomials, (ii) perform orthogonal fitting of points to these polynomials, (iii) remove outlying observations through robust concentration steps (CS), and (iv) perform assembly verification of prefabricated elements in construction projects. As the convergence of CS depends on the initial fitting parameters, the performances of seven deterministic, heuristic, and AI-based (i.e., metaheuristic and global computational intelligence-based) optimization strategies to recover these parameters were evaluated on point clouds of five common prefabricated elements with complex geometries. The comparative analysis considered factors such as the fit quality, object detection accuracy, and computation runtime. Results and Conclusions: Among these methods, the Particle Swarm (PS) achieved the best results, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing, Bayesian, and Genetic Algorithm. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the swarm size, the PS attained 99% and 96% accuracies in object detection and fitting quality, respectively. Finally, the calibrated PS algorithm was applied to the point cloud of a real-world prefabricated spaceframe structure, yielding 98.5% reliability in nodal coordinate estimation compared to the ground truth."

In single-perimeter geometries, where deviations in material deposition directly influence wall thickness and surface quality, precise feed rate control is essential. The proposed computational approach establishes a volumetric relationship between the robot’s motion speed, layer height, and desired extrusion width, enabling accurate determination of the material feed rate from measurable process parameters rather than empirical tuning. The system was implemented within a cyber-physical system (CPS) architecture integrating independent control of the robot and extrusion unit, allowing synchronized motion and material deposition. Experimental validation on cuboid and cylindrical specimens confirmed the model’s effectiveness, achieving minimum wall thickness deviations of 0.027 mm for the cuboid and 0.065 mm for the cylindrical sample. The methodology provides a practical framework for feed rate calibration in robotic FDM systems, supporting consistent extrusion quality, reduced material variation, and faster process setup. Although tested on a specific extrusion system, the approach is scalable to large-format robotic additive manufacturing (RAM) and adaptable to various extrusion materials and configurations."

    "abstract": "Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multidimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank—a critical parameter governing model complexity—is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals.We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RRFBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "Neural interface devices generate large amounts of data that must be transmitted to a host computer for real-time neural decoding. Low-power wireless protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), have limited data throughput, creating challenges for high-fidelity data streaming. We propose a lossless compression method designed to optimize wireless transmission without compromising neural signal integrity. Our compression pipeline includes four key stages: data filtering, cross-channel transformation, predictive coding using an autoregressive (AR) model, and Huffman coding. The method adapts to dynamic neural signal properties by recalculating AR model coefficients at regular intervals, ensuring sustained compression efficiency. This approach achieves a compression ratio between 3.02 and 4.42 while maintaining low computational and memory complexity, making it suitable for implementation on low-power microprocessors. We validated this method on a prototype neural interface using the NRF52840 System-on-Chip (SoC). The device streams 16 neural data channels at a 10 kHz sampling rate to a host via a BLE 5.2 data link. The system sustains a compression ratio of 3.5 and a data throughput of 220 kbps, facilitating real-time, lossless transmission of neural signals with minimal latency. This innovation supports the development of wireless peripheral nerve interfaces for neuroprosthetic control, offering reliable real-time data transfer from neural interfaces to neural decoders over BLE."

    "abstract": "Characterizing uncertainty remains a critical challenge in group decision-making, which has prompted the development of diverse linguistic expressions with flexibility and applicability. However, they predominantly use adaptive linguistic terms coupled with numerical importance degrees, which inherently embed subjective cognitive biases. To address this gap, this study originally introduces hesitant fuzzy ordered linguistic term sets (HFOLTSs), which systematically address dual uncertainties: cognitive ambiguity quantified through multiple linguistic term sets, and importance indeterminacy mitigated by ordered relations. To enhance interpretability and visualization, this study proposes a graphical formalization of HFOLTSs, where hierarchical levels are embedded to reflect the structured nature of ordered relations. In addition, the fundamental operations associated with HFOLTSs, complement, expectation-based comparison, and distance measurement, are established to handle complex linguistic uncertainty. Two aggregation operators, namely, hesitant fuzzy ordered linguistic weighted averaging (HFOLWA) and hesitant fuzzy ordered linguistic ordered weighted averaging (HFOLOWA), are introduced to support group decision-making. To facilitate group consensus, we further devise a mechanism that harmoniously balances consensus efficiency with the willingness of experts. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a contractor selection problem in community renewal, which demonstrates its practicality and effectiveness in managing complex group decision scenarios."

It uses natural language processing (NLP) to monitor the public's feelings toward a law, policy, or marketing strategy. Establishing an approach for acquiring and assessing social media feedback regarding statutes, regulations, and policies represents the core of this method. Information extraction is essential because it combines high worth with substantial difficulty in practice. The automated operation of opinion mining processes must be implemented to extract sentiment from web-based items.

    "abstract": "CLLC resonant converters are attracting topologies for their applications, particularly in EV chargers, among the bidirectional isolated DC-DC converters for enhancement of power density because of the simple circuit configuration and low loss. However, they have the drawback that the switching frequency has to be increased to obtain a wide output voltage range. Applying a diode-clamped three-level circuit to a CLLC resonant converter can be one of the solutions to expand the operation range without the frequency modulation or burst mode by utilizing multi-level voltage waveforms. However, it is unable to realize the voltage balance of the DC capacitors due to a lack of redundant operation modes for charge and discharge. In this paper, a flying-capacitor type three-level circuit with so-called self-balancing capability of the capacitor voltages is investigated applying to a CLLC resonant converter. It is verified that the real-time feedback control of the capacitor voltages and wide output operating range can be realized in a laboratory prototype CLLC converter even at switching frequency of 1 MHz or higher by using a SoC FPGA with high-speed 50 Msps ADC."

Existing denoising methods primarily focus on local texture or frequency modeling, yet they often struggle to simultaneously capture long-range contextual dependencies and recover fine-grained structural details. This imbalance leads to a performance bottleneck between effective denoising and structural preservation. To address this challenge, we propose MRWNet, a spatial-frequency co-enhanced denoising network, which integrates spatial retention mechanisms with frequency-domain feature modeling to improve both structural fidelity and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRWNet achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and qualitative visual quality, validating its robustness and generalization capability under complex noise conditions."

It takes time for the current measurement to be transferred and sampled. Since current measurement delays can degrade voltage balancing performance especially in the medium- and high-frequency operation, the System ID technique is utilized to predict the current in the next switching state and this is shown to correct the error caused by the delay.

However, little attention has been paid to regional brain age measures, which may capture the cognitive functions supported by individual brain regions. Using a sample of 1,703 T1-weighted images from the Human Connectome Projects (HCP-Young adult and HCP-Aging), we constructed 3D convolutional neural networks to estimate the regional brain ages of 18 cortical regions (9 on each cerebral hemisphere). Two hypotheses were tested: (1) on the cerebral cortex, there are higher associations of regional brain ages between homo-topic than non-homotopic region-pairs; and (2) regional brain ages are directly associated with both crystallized and fluid intelligence even after chronological age is factored out. Three methods were implemented to ameliorate the \"regression to the mean\" (RttM) problem, ubiquitous in brain age studies, including Cole’s method, de Lange’s method, and our proposed \"percentile matching\" method, in which the prediction of the testing data is corrected for by mapping the distributional properties of the predicted value and ground truth using the validation data. While our results supported both hypotheses and confirmed the desirable symmetry and association properties, consistent evidence was found only when the regional brain ages were corrected for by either Cole’s method or the percentile matching method. Between these two methods, the latter method yielded smaller mean absolute error and root mean square error, along with larger Spearman’s correlation. Our results highlight the potential of regional brain ages and the percentile matching method in brain age research.Clinical relevance—Regional brain ages exhibit symmetry properties and associations with cognitive functions, and they may represent promising biomarkers of brain ageing."

    "abstract": "Human gut microbiota is an ecosystem involving millions of different microorganisms, its composition and dynamics are related to the host’s health and disease. Current approaches to simplifying its study integrate synthetic microbial communities (SynComs), enabling the analysis of multiple bacteria interaction from a pairwise perspective. For this, batch culture is commonly implemented. However, the response after reaching the stationary condition of this in vitro system does not reflect the biomimetic condition of microbiota in a human gut, where a continuous process is performed. On the other hand, performing continuous culture represents a challenge due to cost, operation volume, and the requirement for prior knowledge of bacterial community kinetic characterization. This work proposes a serial transfer culture approach to approximate the stationary conditions of continuous culture while reducing operation volume by an experimental setup with microbioreactors. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamic set of ordinary differential equations with a switching sequence between batch cultures that depends on three parameters. Numerical simulation and experimental implementation of a mono-specie culture are analyzed to determine the best combination switching parameters: 1 h time of first transfer, 2 h period of transfer and 0.6 transferred volume factor had the lower error norm with 0.602. The continuous, batch, and serial transfer approaches are compared, and their stationary conditions are used to predict the ecological response by the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, all three conditions identified a negative intraspecies interaction, but magnitudes differed. This behavior is also identified when experimental data are used for parameterization.Clinical Relevance— The study of human gut microbiota dynamics is a current challenge for personalized medicine.

Furthermore, the convergence time taken by an RL agent is often high, which makes it difficult to train the RL agent in online settings. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model (LLM)-enhanced RL method that builds and queries a knowledge graph (KG) derived from agent-environment interactions. We leverage the pre-trained knowledge of an LLM on different cybersecurity frameworks and use the LLM to analyze a part of the KG to generate appropriate actions for the RL agent. We infuse the knowledge extracted from the LLM into the RL agent’s training loop in two ways. First, the state vector of the RL agent is augmented with the most effective action and its corresponding reward, as determined from the KG. Second, the suggested action from the LLM is used as a reference policy. In addition, we introduce a regularization term in the loss function to make the RL policy close to the reference policy. To validate our approach, we develop a custom RL environment guided by the MITRE ATT&CK framework, enabling the agent to generate tailored mitigation strategies for detected cyber attacks. Experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline RL by over $75 \\%$ in terms of taking better mitigation actions."

    "abstract": "Conventional cellular systems, including 5G operating in millimeter wave (mmWave, $30-100 \\mathrm{GHz}$), serve users located in the far-field of the base station antenna. One of the distinctive properties of future beyond 6 G cellular terahertz band $(0.3-3 \\mathrm{THz})$ systems is the need to support mobile users located in both near- and far-fields. In the near-field, the received signal strength depends not only on the distance between BS and user equipment (UE) but also on the concrete coordinates of the UE and may fluctuate drastically even for displacements on the order of a wavelength. As a result, near-field propagation models are significantly more complex than far-field models, which makes system-level analysis of such prospective systems challenging. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of nearfield propagation modeling principles and to identify a model that offers a practical compromise between accuracy and analytical tractability. Our results indicate that the best candidate nearfield propagation models for system-level research is the spherical model. Even though such a model is provided in terms of sums of components for phased antenna arrays, it allows for simple approximations for a specific set of carrier frequencies. From the accuracy point of view, it preserves the qualitative behavior of the Hertzian model, which is crucial for near-field communications."

    "abstract": "Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death worldwide, and detecting the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), which essentially relies on the discrimination between pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and pulse-generating rhythm (PR), is critical for patient survival. ECG-based automatic PEA/PR classifiers proposed to date, often show poor performance due to the significant similarities both rhythms present in the ECG pattern. The high temporal resolution cerebral oximetry signal obtained through near-infrared spectroscopy reflects fluctuations correlated with the QRS complexes when a PR rhythm is present. This study introduces a novel classifier based on a random forest (RF), which combines cerebral oximetry and ECG-derived features to improve PEA/PR discrimination. The study dataset included 165 5-second segments of concurrent ECG and oximetry signals, with 90 PR (8 patients) and 75 PEA segments (12 patients). These segments were randomly and patient-wise stratified into a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) for feature selection and RF training/evaluation. A initial set of 350 PEA/PR discrimination features was evaluated, and using a combination of area under the curve scores and recursive feature elimination, the feature set was reduced. In order to assess the added value of cerebral oximetry in PEA/PR discrimination, the proposed classifier was also modeled using solely ECG-based features. The results show that the combined model achieves similar performance to the ECG-only approach, but using substantially fewer features. The combined classifier obtained a mean (standard desviation) specificity, sensitivity and balanced accuracy of 88.3 (5.1)%, 82.4 (4.8)% and 85.3 (2.8)%, respectively, across 20 replicas of the 5-fold CV when only 11 features were used. These findings suggest that the inclusion of high-resolution oximetry signals significantly enhances the detection of ROSC, offering a more computationally efficient and interpretable approach compared to traditional ECG-based methods during OHCA."

Classical primary droop control is beneficial through its decentralization but suffers of drawbacks such as steady-state voltage deviation and improper current sharing. In order to mitigate this, central secondary control is an option. However, this requires an additional communication architecture. In order to avoid costly additional communication infrastructure, this main drawback can be addressed by Talkative Power Conversion (TPC). TPC provides a communication link without additional infrastructure by encoding data into the dc-dc converter switching ripple. This communication link can be used to transmit the necessary control parameters between converters along the dc link.

The characterisation and optimisation of these mixtures were achieved by preparing samples with different types and concentrations of wax and varying concentrations of activated carbon. The electrical properties of the samples were measured using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) over a low-frequency range (1 kHz to 1 MHz). Standardised two-electrode measurement cells were employed to enable comparisons with literature data. PVA can be cross-linked via freeze/thaw cycles to form polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C), a hydrogel with mechanical properties similar to those of living tissue. The PVA-wax emulsions also formed a hydrogel after undergoing a freeze/thaw cycle. In the initial phase of this study, the properties of PVA-C were compared with those of PVA-C containing activated carbon, which was identified as a suitable candidate for mimicking the electrical properties of living fat. The subsequent phase focused on developing a PVA-wax emulsion to reduce the permittivity of the PVA-C at high frequencies, thereby approaching the permittivity of living fat. The mechanical properties of the resulting hydrogel were found to closely resemble those of living fat.Clinical Relevance—This established a methodology for developing an adipose tissue phantom for use in validating bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) sensors in medical applications."

    "abstract": "Solar and wind energy production systems have recently entered the market differently than traditional sources by adding power to electrical grids. These power sources gain and supply energy whenever environmental conditions modify or whenever they need to generate a specific amount of power because of their essential integration into the grid system. Network stability faces great challenges because wind and solar sources generate power sporadically. Rates of energy storage work as practical solutions that store surplus power generated in peak production times for later use when demand peaks or production falls. The study explores the most effective way to optimize energy storage technology through advanced optimization approaches and machine learning algorithms for better integration of renewable power in electrical networks. The study evaluates lithium-ion batteries as well as sodiumsulfur batteries and flow batteries alongside pumped water storage technology and compressed air energy storage (CAES) together with green hydrogen and thermal energy storage systems based on their technical features of efficiency and power density and operational life capability along with economic aspects such as investment costs and operations and maintenance expenses. The analytical system uses genetic algorithms (GA) together with Technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to perform a classification and comparison of the techniques. Each technology shows distinct capabilities and weaknesses which becomes evident from the research findings while demonstrating suitability criteria for different applications. Using machine learning algorithms within energy storage systems enables better optimization of charging and discharging cycles and produces significant improvements in energy storage strategies. The dual-purpose effect from this method simultaneously supports grid stability and renewable energy system sustainability in an economic and environmental perspective."

In contrast, the Republic of Moldova remains 65-70% dependent on imports, with a modest domestic capacity of less than 0.5 GW, but with growing demand (+9% in 2024). [8] The share of renewable energy in national consumption has reached 36% (665 MW installed), supported by policies aligned with the EU target of reaching a 30% share by 2030.

    "abstract": "The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However, instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce \"zero-overhead loop nests\" to remove control overheads, and a \"zero-conflict memory subsystem\", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and 8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider range of workloads."

    "abstract": "This paper presents novel Temperature Balancing Continuous and Discontinuous PWM methods (TBCM and TBDM, respectively) designed to enhance stall torque by achieving thermal balance among inverter switching devices. Conventional Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) is a widely used PWM technique due to its ability to produce low current harmonics in the low modulation region offering superior switching noise performance. In contrast, Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation (DPWM) is employed to improve inverter efficiency. However, in the low-speed region, the quasi-DC nature of phase currents causes both PWM methods to generate an uneven distribution of power loss across the power devices. This imbalance results in unequal thermal stress due to variations in device characteristics (such as IGBTs and diodes). The degree of thermal stress variation depends on the rotor position, resulting in a higher maximum inverter temperature and ultimately limiting the electric drive's torque capability. The proposed methods address this issue by adaptively redistributing power loss and heat using feedback from temperature estimation and rotor position, thereby improving torque performance at stall. Simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness of these PWM methods."

We utilized a dataset of over 900,000 Chinese reports and explored the effectiveness of prompt engineering and LoRA fine-tuning techniques on various LLMs. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly Qwen2.5-14B, achieved high accuracy in predicting standardized department and item detail names, significantly outperforming traditional methods like BERT. Notably, the model exhibits strong generalization capabilities, achieving high accuracy on unseen hospital data with an average accuracy of 98.34% in cross-validation experiments. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in medical data standardization, laying the foundation for automated processing and analysis of large-scale medical data."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a concept study of a week-long experimental protocol for controlling a lower-limb exoskeleton via a brain-machine interface. The system employed a neural network adapted from EEGNet that distinguishes motor imagery and resting states in a two-dimensional space under both static and movement conditions. Each day, the model was fine-tuned with that day’s training data as well as data from previous days. Daily closed-loop asynchronous evaluations were carried out to assess real-time exoskeleton control performance. The results indicate steady improvements in system accuracy over the week, likely due to the cumulative integration of additional data, which enhanced the neural network-based approach to cognitive state classification in a multi-day setting.Clinical relevance—Incorporating repetitive robotic therapies in which the patient can actively engage in rehabilitation is a core goal of neurorehabilitation. Developing non-invasive brain-machine interfaces that enable an increasingly effective mind-robot connection is of great importance. This work outlines a protocol for creating a brain-machine interface controlled by motor imagery."

The approach extends the nullspace-based residual filter design technique originally developed for linear time-invariant systems and previously adapted for fault detection in LTV systems. Fault isolation is achieved by treating certain faults as disturbances, enabling a significant extension of the detection scheme to isolate specific faults through residual decoupling. The method leverages symbolic nullspace computations to account explicitly for the time-varying nature of the problem. The proposed fault detection and isolation framework is demonstrated on a robotic manipulator example, where time variations arise from motion along a predefined trajectory. Simulation results based on a nonlinear model validate the effectiveness of the approach."

    "abstract": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive functional neuroimaging technique widely employed in brain-computer interface (BCI) research and diverse clinical applications. The key challenge in fNIRS applications lies in extracting nonlinear structures and complex patterns from one-dimensional time series data. Gramian angular difference field (GADF) transforms one-dimensional time series into two-dimensional images, providing effective feature representation for subsequent signal classification. However, most studies have not explored the combined effects of image features and time series features. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, VisiTempNet, which integrates both time series and GADF image features in a temporal-spatial fusion approach. The model first performs convolution on time series data based on delayed hemodynamic responses to highlight key features. It then separates the feature extraction process into two parallel modules, and normalizes and fuses these features with learnable weights, assigning greater importance to the most relevant information for classification. Experimental results show that our model achieved an accuracy of 76.65±2.43% on the open access fNIRS2MW dataset, outperforming all baseline models. This validates the effectiveness of combining image and time series features and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model."

    "abstract": "Human-machine interfaces based on Electromyographic (EMG) armbands are commonly utilized for gesture recognition using cross-sectional feature extraction (FE) schemes, those typically ignoring long-and short-term activity trends. This approach lacks the ability to capture the different movements’ context and often generates spurious decisions based on short windows of non-stationary EMG signals. The current study builds upon recent advances in spatial information extraction, as represented by our Phasor-based Multi-signal Waveform Length (MSWL) features, by encapsulating these features within a temporal context framework. Two streams of information are concatenated: a short-term memory component emphasizing partial correlation with previous analysis windows and a long-term component emphasizing the trend of the features belonging to the specific movements. The proposed method was evaluated on EMG datasets from: 1) twenty-two subjects using two simultaneously placed armbands with different sampling frequencies (200Hz MYO and 1000Hz 3DC), and 2) six transradial amputees following the NinaPro protocol and using the MYO armband for 17 movement classes. Our findings using the LibEMG toolbox show that context-aware EMG feature extraction achieves sampling frequency invariance in gesture pattern recognition. Despite literature favoring higher frequency armbands, our method delivers similar average accuracy (91%, p-value>0.05) across both high- and low-frequency armbands. Notably, our method outperforms 58 FE methods from the LibEMG toolbox, this is further supported by the findings on the amputees’ database highlighting its efficacy in context-sensitive EMG pattern recognition.Clinical Relevance— This study shows that context-aware EMG feature extraction achieves high accuracy in clinical gesture recognition, challenging the traditional preference for higher frequency devices."

    "abstract": "The rise of self-supervised learning (SSL) in medical imaging holds immense potential, particularly for leveraging unlabeled data and achieving surprising performance in scenarios with limited annotations. Our study shows that comparisons with traditional supervised learning (SL) are often confounded by differences in workflows, leading to potentially biased conclusions. The SL paradigm is typically employed with a one-stage training workflow, while the typical SSL linear evaluation workflow involves a two-stage process: pre-training a backbone with a projector, followed by fine-tuning a randomly initialized task-specific classification head replacing the projector. We show that the two-stage workflow, when applied to SL, can change the trained model performance. This is especially important when selecting the appropriate paradigm for medical imaging classification where the outcomes can have a clinical impact. We experimented with four medical imaging datasets, targeting age prediction and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis from brain MRI, pneumonia diagnosis from chest RX, and diagnosis of retina with choroidal neurovascularization from optical coherence tomography. For each dataset, we imposed different configurations of assumed label availability and class frequency distribution. For each configuration, we performed 30 experiments (5 for the larger dataset) and a robust statistical analysis of the results, which show that the different workflows can alter the trained model performance. This finding suggests that the typical comparisons between SL and SSL in literature may not solely reflect the learning paradigm itself but also the workflow, which is agnostic to the paradigm. In the field of medical imaging, where model performance directly impacts clinical decision-making and patient outcomes, ensuring fair and robust comparisons is critical. By addressing this overlooked bias, our work provides actionable insights to advance reliable methodologies, paving the way for more effective and trustworthy AI-driven solutions in healthcare."

While the IBRs with GFM control typically incur higher costs due to their reliance on energy storage and the most existing IBRs are based on Grid-Following (GFL) control, it is of great interest to know the minimum required amount of GFM converters, e.g. in a wind farm, for ensuring stability under contingent events without losing generation. This paper proposed a method of determining the ratio of GFM converters at an IBR connecting to the grid based on impedance analysis. The impedance of GFM converters, GFL converters and grid can be obtained through perturbation-based scanning using Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations, where detailed behavior of power electronics converters and controllers (including Blackbox controller) can be captured. The proposed procedure can calculate the mixed GFL/GFM system impedance and then determine the stability margin or the minimum ratio of GFM required to ensure stability, with no need to derive mathematical models of the grid or converters, which are often highly complex or unavailable."

    "abstract": "High-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG) signals have been extensively explored for decoding motion intent, but it is known to be susceptible to the relative position of electrodes and muscles. Previous studies have shown that changes in the position of subcutaneous muscles may have an effect on surface EMG signals. However, it is difficult to quantify relative displacement directly in many studies where electrode-muscle shift occurs. The study further investigates the effect of electrodes position offset caused by shifts on the HD sEMG signals by quantifying the quantitative relationship between subcutaneous muscle displacement and innervation zone (IZ) displacement. In this study, the displacement of IZ obtained by HD sEMG was used as the predicted value and the subcutaneous muscle displacement obtained by ultrasound images was the true value. A total of eight able-bodied subjects were recruited for the data collection phase of the test. The positive correlation between subcutaneous muscle displacement and IZ displacement of the flexor carpi radialis was demonstrated by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r=0.9383). This provides a new idea for indirectly measuring the amount of muscle displacement and it may be possible to use IZ displacement instead of electrode-muscle shift in future studies."

    "abstract": "Innovation often depends on transferring ideas across disciplines, yet finding relevant knowledge outside one’s field remains difficult and time-consuming. Conventional search tools typically emphasize keyword, semantic, or citation similarity rather than the deeper analogical or interdisciplinary connections that frequently drive breakthroughs. This paper presents FusionTRIZ, a framework that combines large-scale semantic literature mining with TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), a codified set of 40 inventive principles distilled from decades of patent analysis. FusionTRIZ operates in four steps: (1) retrieve in-domain solution papers from a large scientific corpus; (2) use a large language model (LLM) to extract each solution’s TRIZ profile; (3) retrieve highly interdisciplinary solutions from other domains; and (4) filter cross-domain papers by their TRIZ alignment with the in-domain profile. This process surfaces conceptually relevant ideas even when the technical language, terminology, or application area differs greatly. In a focused case study (neuromorphic imaging) on tracking rapid motion in low light, FusionTRIZ identifies a polarization-enhanced sensing design from space-target tracking research. This bioinspired approach matches multiple inventive principles found in domain literature. Results suggest that combining TRIZ principle extraction with automated retrieval expands the search space for analogies, reduces ideation effort, and accelerates systematic innovation across diverse fields."

However, the model-based SM acquired methods suffers from a non-negligible modeling error, while the measurement-based acquisition is time-consuming and often necessitates frequent repetition to ensure accuracy. In this paper, we introduced an anisotropic prior-guided transformer generative adversarial network(APT-GAN) for high-precision system Matrix generation in MPI. Specifically, a two-step strategy was adopted to eliminat the need for the repetitive measurement calibration process and ensure the generated SMs are not only realistic but also physically plausible. Fisrtly, we constructed the SM prior by improved anisotropy equilibrium model, then we developed the APT-GAN leveraging prior knowledge, featuring a generator with multiple cascaded generative transformer(GT) modules that include attention and feedforward mechanisms, and a discriminator based on an enhanced VGG architecture with integrated AvgPool2d layers. Experiments results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing magnetization model in SM generating and generates high-quality MPI images."

Deep learning models promise personalized patient prognosis, but they require large amounts of training data for good results. In healthcare, this presents a particular challenge as most datasets, especially tabular data, are manually entered by clinicians during trials. Missing data poses another significant hurdle. While deleting incomplete rows might seem logical, this further reduces the already limited sample size. A popular alternative is data imputation—estimating missing values using the dataset’s distribution—but this requires several assumptions to be valid and useful. Healthcare data also frequently contains non-numerical covariates like text descriptors, which require careful conversion to avoid introducing bias and noise.We propose a novel approach that sidesteps these issues by using large language models (LLMs) to create comprehensive sentences containing all relevant subject information. This approach offers several key benefits: patient data can be added directly without conversion, missing data becomes a non-issue as descriptions can be as detailed as needed, and the natural variability of clinical documentation is simulated through random masking. We demonstrate this method’s effectiveness by creating a simple network trained on our synthetic data that achieves comparable results to previous survival analysis research on the FLCHAIN, METABRIC, and SUPPORT datasets. Importantly, our approach is inherently intuitive, presenting a prognostic model that can stratify risk groups using human-like sentences. C-index: 0.857, 0.690, 0.985, IBS: 0.108, 0.188, 0.213"

This study computationally investigates the mechanisms underlying paresthesia reduction by evaluating activation thresholds and short-term fidelity across conventional, FAST, and burst waveforms. Using a modified McIntyre-Richardson-Grill (MRG) axon model implemented via the PyFibers python package, we simulated neural responses to bipolar stimulation with two pulse widths (0.2 ms, 1 ms) and charge-balancing methods (active and passive). Burst waveforms exhibited lower activation thresholds than conventional and FAST paradigms, particularly for smaller fiber diameters. However, fidelity increased gradually for burst stimulation, reaching only 43–53% fidelity at 150% of threshold amplitude, compared to 100% fidelity for conventional and FAST waveforms at amplitudes of 116% and 124% of activation thresholds, respectively. Voltage heat maps demonstrated irregular intraburst action potential patterns in burst stimulation, with bi- and uni-directional propagation and de-synchronized activation, compared to consistent, pulse-locked responses of conventional and FAST waveforms. These irregular firing patterns, coupled with lower fidelity, suggest a mechanistic basis for reduced paresthesia in burst SCS. The results underscore the trade-off between stimulation efficacy and neural synchronization, providing insights for optimizing waveform design to balance analgesia and patient comfort.Clinical relevance— Burst SCS reduces paresthesia by desynchronizing axonal firing, evidenced by lower fidelity and irregular activation. Although higher amplitudes are needed for activation, the burst responses may provide a paresthesia-free alternative for pain management."

Additionally, a time-by-time generalization approach indicated that neural representations of sequence complexity remained stable from the fourth visual stimulus onward, suggesting that the brain dynamically adjusts its oscillatory rhythms to accommodate the cognitive demands of the task. These findings provide new insights into the flexible nature of working memory and demonstrate how low-frequency oscillations coordinate memory representations across brain regions to support increasingly complex cognitive tasks."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of surgeons to perform solo laparoscopic anastomosis by introducing an innovative approach that uses feet-driven supernumerary robotic manipulation. This system allows surgeons to effectively and intuitively perform coordinated four-handed manipulation over two robotic arms. In a quasi-real-world medical scenario, a behavioral investigation is carried out to assess the feasibility and usability of the system during laparoscopic anastomosis performed by professional surgeons. The study compares the conventional dyad condition with the robotic-assisted solo condition regarding performance, usability, and workload. Eleven surgeons who possess expertise in laparoscopy, anastomosis, or both, have been involved in this investigation. The results demonstrate the system’s feasibility in performing supernumerary laparoscopic tasks, highlighting its capability for enhancing the procedures. Using our robotic solution, surgeons were able to perform the surgical task, on average, 5.18% faster than when using the traditional setup in a human-dyad team (dyad condition: 295.09 [s]; solo condition: 280.55 [s]). They, however, reported a significant increase in the perceived workload when performing the task in the solo mode as compared to doing it in dyads. They could control the proposed bipedal system within ten minutes of training. Yet, a longer training period might be necessary to improve arms and feet coordination."

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of EVs necessitates continuous advancements in battery system technologies, making accurate leakage current assessments of the overall system a crucial task. Direct measurement of total leakage current, including cell self-discharge and external circuit leakage, is technically challenging, due to the sophisticated internal current paths and self-discharging mechanisms. Existing methods require long observation periods to find distinguishable voltage drops, and the leakage current can only be calculated indirectly with the help of state-of-charge (SoC) curves, which are inaccurate due to different discharging rates. This paper proposes a time-efficient, direct measurement method based on controlled charge injection and determination of the time interval between identical SoC points, before and after the injection. To mitigate measurement noise affecting the same-SoC-point identification, a statistical cross-threshold-point detection method is introduced that operates on the unfiltered raw measurement data. Experiments verifying the measurement results are in-line with data found in literature."

In this paper, the influence of the temperature change at the rotor airflow outlet on the stator temperature distribution is investigated. Based on the coupled model of electromagnetic field, fluid field and temperature field, the fluid and temperature field distribution law of the 300-Mvar air-cooled synchronous condenser is computed to reveal the change of the temperature at the rotor airflow outlet with the operating conditions, and analyse its influence on the stator temperature rise. After that, the simulation results are verified experimentally based on a 300 Mvar synchronous condenser. On this basis, with lower temperature and more uniform distribution of the hottest point of the synchronous condenser as the optimization objective, the cooling gas airflow distribution of the synchronous condenser is optimized based on the multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm, and the cooling airflow distribution optimization scheme is formulated. The results can provide the reference for the accurate temperature calculation and the optimization design of the cooling systems for the large air-cooled SC."

    "abstract": "While the slotless Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs) exhibit numerous advantages compared to their slotted counterparts, they are adversely affected by significant winding eddy current losses attributable to their direct exposure to the rotating magnetic fields generated by permanent magnets. In this study, a design optimization methodology that incorporates a rapid and precise estimation of winding eddy current losses via a Fourier series-based field model is introduced. To alleviate winding eddy current losses while concurrently minimizing the mass of the winding, hybrid coil configurations comprising copper and aluminum strands are employed, with their efficacy assessed against conventional copper-only coil designs. By substituting the upper layers of the coils with aluminum, which possesses a lower electrical conductivity than copper, a reduction in eddy current losses can be achieved. The outcomes of single-objective optimization indicate that slotless PMSMs utilizing hybrid coils demonstrate enhanced efficiency in comparison to traditional slotless PMSMs within the same weight limitations. Furthermore, the analysis conducted on multi-objective optimization concerning both loss and weight suggests that the incorporation of aluminum wire for the upper layers of the coils represents a viable solution for achieving lightweight, high-efficiency slotless PMSMs."

The Contrast-Phys model was evaluated on the CAMVISIM_LAB data and the UBFC-RPPG and PURE datasets, as the latter two are among the most popular datasets for the performance assessment of rPPG methods.The initial evaluation of the heart rate estimation on CAMVISIM_LAB was conducted by training a Contrast-Phys model from scratch using k-fold cross-validation, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.7 bpm. This was improved by using a model pre-trained on the UBFC dataset for rPPG estimation, which improved the result to 5.8 bpm. The error was further minimised by fine-tuning the model with the pretrained weights from UBFC and using our dataset for a second training run. This resulted in an improved MAE of 1.0 bpm when fine-tuning and freezing the initial layers of the ContrastPhys model during training. This result outperformed the score achieved when using the same strategy on the PURE dataset."

If a primary-side switch fault occurs, the full-bridge LLC converter may transition into half-bridge mode to maintain continuous operation without interruption. Under this condition, robust fault detection and localization method is critical. The proposed method uses only a single voltage sensor to monitor the resonant capacitor voltage (RCV). OC faults in primary-side switches are first detected by analyzing the slope of the integral of the measured RCV signal, and then applies phase-shift modulation to induce additional slope variations for precise faulty-switch localization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally validated on a 125W/24V LLC converter."

Realtime data analysis for connected vehicles is a solution that uses the continuous data stream produced by vehicles, sensors in the infrastructure, and external sources. The goal of the proposal is to provide a framework where connected vehicle data can be analyzed in real-time to support smart city dynamic decision-making. The framework utilizes edge and cloud computing, machine learning, and predictive analytics to analyze data from various sources, thus providing insights that can help understand the flow of traffic, the prediction of accidents, and the development of optimal route plans. The research checks out how the suggested framework acts by simulations and real datasets, especially in areas like latency, scalability, and prediction accuracy. The findings show that such real-time analysis can effectively improve traffic management, shorten travel times, and generate better protection for pedestrians in an urban area.

An efficient gradient coil design for Halbach array scanners is desired to get high-quality magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, there is still a challenge in obtaining desirable linearity and efficiency at the target diameter of spherical volume (DSV) for axial gradient coils using target field methods. This work aims to investigate the discrete wire approach to design efficient gradient coils for Halbach array scanners. The coil turns of each quadrant of both transverse and axial gradient coils were parameterized using quasi-elliptic functions. The gradient coils are then optimized to maximize the coil’s efficiency while keeping the linearity error and the maximum field deviation less than 10% and lower than 5%, respectively. The coil geometric parameters, current, turn locations, center of a quadrant, and quasi-elliptic parameters are used as the design variables. Results showed that the designed Y, X, and Z (axial), gradient coils could achieve 2.84 mT/m/A, 2.40 mT/m/A, and 1.21 mT/m/A, respectively over a cylindrical volume with a length of 6 cm and a diameter of 6 cm.

    "abstract": "This study presents finite element modelling of a two-electrode standardised measuring cell filled with materials mimicking the electrical properties of biological tissues. Samples, prepared using various formulations, were characterised via bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) over a frequency range from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Impedance values were calculated as the ratio of output voltage to applied current. The standardised measuring cells were modelled in Ansys® Maxwell finite element software, using electrical parameters derived from experimental data. The results demonstrate that the finite element model closely mirrors the experimental measurement. Once the model will accurately replicate the electrical behaviour of these specific materials in simple geometries, more complex anthropomorphic models may be considered.Clinical Relevance— The clinical relevance of this study lies in its potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of bioimpedance-based diagnostic tools by offering a reliable numerical modelling approach for tissue phantoms. This could improve the understanding of tissue composition, tissue hydration, and cellular health in clinical settings."

    "abstract": "Late-onset sepsis affects between 10 to 25% of very premature babies, standing as a primary contributor to neonatal mortality. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that relies solely on the analysis of newborns’ motion, derived from the processing of videos acquired in neonatal intensive care units, for several consecutive days. Among a group of 16 very premature newborns, consisting of 8 sepsis and 8 control subjects, we initially extract 14 distinct motion features, in a total of 2636 hours of video recordings. These features are processed through a fusion of fuzzy spatio-temporal coding and smoothed principal component analysis. It leads to 16 trajectories, one per newborn, positioned differently in a 2D plane. They are then compared across parameters such as position, speed, and acceleration. Our findings underscore significant differences in 8 trajectory parameters between sepsis and control newborns. Finally, unsupervised classification was used to separate infected and healthy newborns using these parameters, achieving an accuracy of 81.3%.Clinical relevance— This approach offers a non invasive video-based motion method for early sepsis detection in premature newborns, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving neonatal outcomes."

    "abstract": "Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear. Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space, achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1 regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision pharmacotherapy.Clinical relevance— This study provides a fully data-driven framework for identifying key patient-specific factors influencing pharmacokinetics. By leveraging multiple techniques, the proposed methodology is highly adaptable, and applicable to multiple population pharmacokinetic studies, with the potential to improve therapeutic drug monitoring and patient treatment efficacy."

    "abstract": "Accurate identification of epileptogenic zones (EZ) is essential for effective surgical intervention in drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Traditional graph-based methods often fail to capture the higher-order functional interactions in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data, where such interactions reflect complex network-level dependencies among multiple nodes, beyond simple pairwise or localized connectivity patterns. To address this, we propose the Hypergraph-Regularized (HyRe) Dynamic Model, which integrates temporal dependencies and hypergraph-based connectivity for modeling seizure dynamics. We validate our method on three publicly available epilepsy datasets: CHB-MIT Scalp EEG, the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, and the HUP iEEG Dataset. Our results demonstrate that HyRe improves seizure stage classification. Additionally, we compute neural fragility and Source-Sink Index (SSI) for EZ localization using the estimated W from HyRe, comparing these results with those from existing methods. These findings suggest that hypergraph-regularized dynamic models offer a potential framework for precise modeling and understanding of seizure dynamics, which could aid clinical decision-making."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy is a common pathological condition characterized by calcium deposits within the rotator cuff tendons, leading to severe pain and restricted shoulder mobility. This pathology progresses through distinct stages, during which the hardness of the calcification gradually decreases. The gold-standard treatment is ultrasound-guided percutaneous irrigation; however, this procedure can only be performed once the calcification has softened sufficiently to allow calcium deposit removal via needling and saline solution lavage. For this reason, the timing between diagnosis and intervention is highly variable and unpredictable, necessitating a reliable method to assess calcification maturation and optimize treatment planning for improved clinical outcomes.Ultrasound imaging is highly operator-dependent, and its use as a monitoring tool in clinical practice is limited by the need for specialized expertise and restricted access to expert evaluations.In this work, we propose a proof-of-concept for two tele-ultrasound approaches that enable remote ultrasound acquisition: (a) a tele-guided procedure, in which a radiologist provides remote guidance during image acquisition, and (b) an offline remote monitoring, in which ultrasound images are acquired independently without real-time assistance. Both procedures were evaluated at two distinct time points.Four regions of interest were identified from the best frames selected by the radiologist, and quantitative metrics, potentially correlating with calcification maturation, were extracted (e.g., bone reflection index, contrast, roughness, skewness and kurtosis). An expert radiologist reviewed the results and deemed the ultrasound images acquired with both procedures clinically informative and suitable for guiding treatment decisions. Additionally, the quantitative metrics showed a strong correlation with clinical findings.Clinical Relevance— This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of two remote ultrasound monitoring approaches to support clinical decision-making in the management of rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy. In the long term, integrating automated processes could facilitate the extraction of quantitative metrics from patient-acquired images, providing an objective assessment of disease progression. This approach has the potential to revolutionize rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy monitoring by ensuring more timely interventions through a remote and quantitative framework."

Eccentricity faults, a common mechanical issue, can lead to further motor failures and permanent damage if not detected early. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is an effective technique for detecting such faults. However, when using switched amplifier PHIL-based emulation, the presence of switching harmonics in the frequency spectrum complicates MCSA. To address this challenge, this paper develops a voltage-behind reactance (VBR) model for eccentricity faults. The model is capable of emulating both axially uniform and more complex axially non-uniform eccentricity faults under various loading conditions. Experimental validation is performed using a micro-machine of a scaled-down 2.5 MW wound rotor induction motor with eccentricity faults."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)-based framework for generating realistic 2D ultrasound images conditioned on 3D ultrasound probe (US-probe) poses, including both spatial position and orientation. The dataset, acquired from a breast ultrasound phantom (BB-03), consists of 2,656 multi-view B-mode images paired with 6-degree-of-freedom US-probe parameters, providing diverse US-probe movements and orientations to ensure comprehensive multi-view coverage for training. The US-probe positions and orientations are encoded using a positional encoding scheme that enables the model to learn spatial relationships between probe placement and internal anatomy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model generates anatomically consistent grayscale ultrasound slices across diverse probe poses. Moreover, the results indicate that the proposed positional encoding method enhances the quality and realism of the synthesized images, showing improved alignment with US-probe position and orientation compared to a baseline approach. This is further reflected by consistently high Pose-Consistency Scores (PCS) ranging from 0.8766 to 0.8950. In addition, quantitative image quality assessments indicate that the synthesized images achieve performance close to the acceptable ranges across standard ultrasound evaluation metrics. Although further refinements are needed to enhance realism, these findings highlight the potential of CGAN-based frameworks for ultrasound image synthesis, where preserving both probe-dependent spatial positioning and anatomical structural consistency remains essential."

In this study, a novel model named CVCResNSFormer is proposed to enhance short-term PV power forecasting accuracy and efficiency. The forecasting framework is primarily composed of two modules: the CVC Module and the ResBG Module. In the CVC Module, leading variables and their lead times are accurately predicted at various time nodes, enabling effective utilization of forward-looking information by lagging variables. The ResBG Module incorporates a ResNet-like architecture where both linear and non-linear features are preserved, resulting in improved simulation of future curve characteristics. Experimental validation on real-world datasets confirms the superior performance of CVCResNSFormer compared to existing deep learning approaches, particularly in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. These results suggest strong potential for renewable energy applications, providing a reliable and scalable power forecasting solution for sustainable energy systems. The model's effectiveness is quantitatively verified through two performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), both indicating exceptional predictive accuracy and stability."

In the context of avian studies, miniaturized biologgers have proven instrumental in investigating flight dynamics, particularly in species such as homing pigeons (Columba Livia). While earlier research has principally classified pigeon flight as either flock or solo only based on release conditions, free-flight scenarios are more complex, involving variations in route choice, pausing behavior and different pooling in comparison to original release conditions. To address this gap, a novel instrumental approach is presented in this paper to automatically detect homing pigeons’ flight type and flock size and to take into account modifications of the previous characteristics over urban and extra-urban areas, by equipping homing pigeons with wearable sensors. To deeply characterize pigeons’ flight in flock or solo condition above urban and extra-urban areas, wingbeat frequency, peak-to-peak acceleration and ground speed were computed. In comparison to the original releases conditions, in approximately a half of the total releases solo-released pigeons joined the flock and vice versa, indicating a consistent pattern to deviate from the initial release configuration, which may lead to a realistic analyses of solo or pooling behavior during flight.The results show that pigeons flying in flock exhibit a higher wingbeat frequency compared to solo flight modality, while showing an inverse pattern for peak-to-peak acceleration. Comparing urban and non-urban environments, the results show that in extra-urban contexts pigeons exhibit a reduction in wingbeat frequency when flying in flocks. Additionally, they tend to form larger flocks compared to those observed in urban settings."

Traditional SOH estimation methods face significant challenges, including nonlinear battery degradation, sensor noise, and variations in operating conditions. Data-driven techniques, such as deep learning, offer high accuracy but require large datasets and high computational power, while Kalman filters are computationally efficient but suffer from lower accuracy. This paper is the first to apply neural network aided Kalman filter (KalmanNet) for battery SOH estimation, combining the adaptability of deep learning with the efficiency of Kalman filtering to strike a balance between accuracy and computational load. KalmanNet dynamically updates state estimates and noise covariance without requiring extensive training data or accurate battery models. The preliminary results demonstrate that KalmanNet achieves higher estimation accuracy compared to two conventional approaches, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Sigma-Point Kalman Filter (SPKF), highlighting its potential as a promising solution for real-time battery SOH estimation."

    "abstract": "Cognitive performance, particularly focus and attention, is critical for academic success, and lifestyle factors such as breakfast consumption significantly influence these functions. However, existing studies often rely on subjective measures, leaving a gap in objective, quantitative assessments. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Optimal Representative Selection via Earth Mover’s Divergence (ORS-EMD), which leverages Earth Mover’s Divergence (EMD) to objectively quantify the impact of breakfast on cognitive performance using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The ORS-EMD framework computes pairwise dissimilarities between EEG segments using EMD, identifies optimal representative segments for each group, and classifies new EEG segments as healthy (breakfast-consumed) or unhealthy (breakfast-skipped) based on a divergence thresholding rule. Our results demonstrate that breakfast consumption significantly enhances cognitive performance, as evidenced by faster task completion times (6.1 ±0.5 minutes for the breakfast group vs. 8.3 ±0.7 minutes for the no-breakfast group, p < 0.001) and distinct neural activity patterns. The ORS-EMD framework achieved an accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming traditional methods such as time-domain features (85.3%) and frequency-domain features (88.7%). This study provides a quantitative, evidence-based framework for understanding the impact of breakfast on cognitive performance, highlighting the potential of EEG-based analysis in real-world educational and healthcare settings."

These practices enable cheating, compromise fair assessment processes, and damage the credibility of educational institutions. The shift to online learning environments has exacerbated these challenges, as traditional methods of ensuring the security of exams are less effective in digital settings. This growing issue necessitates robust solutions to safeguard exam materials and maintain equity in the evaluation process. This research introduces a novel framework that integrates NLP-driven question generation with Shamir's Secret Sharing and multi-layer encryption, combining the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{T 5}$</tex> model and advanced cryptographic methods to securely and efficiently manage academic assessments. The system involves a pre-trained T5 transformer model for automated generating high-quality, contextually relevant questions, minimising work in preparing an examination. These questions have been divided into multiple shares with the help of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme, which has a predefined threshold to reconstruct them. Each share is encrypted with algorithms like AES, Blowfish, and ChaCha20 to enable robust multi-layer protection. Results showed strong performance for the system as indicated by BLEU and ROUGE1 competitive scores in question generation and efficient encryption/decryption times. Share generation took about 0.0005 seconds, while reconstruction took about 0.0056 seconds. This framework scales well, is secure, and efficient for protecting examination content by ensuring fairness and integrity when conducting online assessments."

    "abstract": "Next-generation networks, such as 6 G antenna designs, are focused on meeting the demands of future wireless networks. This study aims to design a system for controlling the temperature in microstrip antennas so that it can provide its best performance under changing environmental conditions. Due to the antenna's small size and simplicity of integration into PCBs, they can be integrated into mobile phones and satellite communications. However, they are sensitive to temperature changes. As a result of these changes, the resonant frequency will shift, and impedance mismatches will occur, leading to impacts on the antenna's performance. The substrate material chosen was Teflon due to its excellent dielectric properties. Simulations in MATLAB were carried out along with the Antenna Designer tool to comprehend a pseudocode algorithm on how temperature affects the dimensions and performance of an antenna. The simulations showed that when the temperature increased, there was a change in the dielectric constant, which in turn caused a decrease in both the width and length of the patch substrate. Adding a controller to adjust the height of the substrate helped keep a high antenna gain and achieve a 3 GHz resonance frequency at all times as the dielectric constant shifts. The results enabled the development of the proposed hardware implementation for the antenna design."

Therefore, minimizing harmonic electromagnetic fields (EMF) is crucial to comply with standards published by CISPR. A WPT system utilizing a flying-capacitor linear amplifier (FCLA) has been proposed to mitigate radiation noise. However, only low-power experiments had been conducted using the FCLA with the number of MOSFETs limited to two. This paper proposes a high-frequency FCLA with a controller configuration that allows function at high frequencies while minimizing voltage distortion through an open-loop control method that excludes feedback components. Moreover, the gate driver with digital input isolates multi-stage MOSFETs, enabling a high-power output from the FCLA. Experimental results show that the 3.1 kW WPT system employing a 30-series FCLA and a three-level rectifier achieves 91.3% DC-DC efficiency. Moreover, the prototype decreases the third-order harmonic component of radiation noise by 16.0dB compared to the conventional H-bridge-based WPT system with a square-wave output."

However, EMG signals are inherently nonlinear and susceptible to noise contamination, which poses challenges for traditional signal processing methods. In this study, we propose the use of entropy metrics to evaluate the dynamic complexity and irregularity of surface electromyographic (EMG) signals of patients assisted with mechanical ventilation. Shannon entropy and spectral entropy were computed to analyze EMG signals from two surface diaphragm channels recorded in mechanically ventilated patients during extubation preparation. According to clinical criteria, the patients were classified into the successful group (GE) – 19 patients with successful extubation after 48 hours, and the failure group (GF) – 21 patients who required reconnection to the ventilator within 48 hours. sEMG signals were recorded using 5-channel surface electrodes placed around the diaphragm muscle. Shannon and spectral entropies were calculated using a 0.5-minute window with an overlap of 80%. The results presented a greater complexity of the EMG signal in the SG group. This group shows higher peaks in Shannon entropy and elevated spectral entropy values compared to the FG group. Channels 2 and 3 presented the largest statistically significant differences.Clinical Relevance— Analyzing diaphragm EMG signals using entropy metrics could improve patient outcomes by optimizing the timing of extubation. These metrics would serve as a key indicator of readiness for extubation, providing an objective basis for more informed clinical decision-making."

The resulting design data was used to train an artificial neural network (ANN), enabling rapid prediction of machine performance without the need for repeated FEA simulations. Case study results indicate that values of torque constant can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy, even for designs of a different size from the simulated set used for training. The proposed ML framework can significantly reduce design time and computational burden, providing a practical tool for efficiently exploring the design space in the optimization process."

In terms of four time-domain BPV features, significantly stronger temporal BPV response occurred when increasing either PF or PA (p-value<0.05). And the PA demonstrated more pronounced effect on the BPV response compared to the PF and the interaction effect of PF and PA.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) challenges and synchronous rectifier (SR) issues that arise during boost operation in series resonant converters (SRCs). Resonant converters are widely adopted in electric vehicle (EV) charging systems due to their high efficiency and high-power density. As the EV battery voltage increases from 400 V to 800 V, the ability of resonant converters to support a wide output voltage range becomes a significant advantage. Among them, SRCs are preferred due to their inherently low primary-side circulating current resulting from a large magnetizing inductance. Optimal efficiency is achieved by operating near the resonant point. However, the SRC is fundamentally limited to a maximum voltage gain of unity. To extend the output voltage range while maintaining high efficiency, pulse-width modulation (PWM) control is employed. By reconfiguring the secondary-side full-bridge rectifier into a voltage-doubler structure, the voltage gain curve can be effectively doubled. This enables both wide output voltage range and high efficiency. However, under PWM operation, the inherently low magnetizing current of the SRC results in insufficient energy to achieve ZVS, which leads to increased switching losses and reduced efficiency. Furthermore, improper turn-off timing of the synchronous rectifier (SR) can cause additional power losses or even device failure. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a control strategy that enables full-range ZVS operation in PWM-controlled SRCs, thereby achieving high efficiency and robust performance across a wide output voltage range."

    "abstract": "Wrist fractures are common injuries among children, significantly impacting daily activities and contributing to prolonged wait times in emergency departments. Portable ultrasound is a safe, radiation-free, and cost-effective diagnostic tool with real-time imaging capabilities to identify these fractures. Ultrasound (US) videos offer dynamic, detailed views for fracture detection but can be lengthy and redundant, making interpretation time-consuming for clinicians. To address this challenge, we developed a novel video summarization and fracture detection method using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The DRL agent emulates a human expert by analyzing the entire video, selecting diagnostically relevant frames, and leveraging a CNN to classify these frames as either normal or fractured. The reward mechanism, which prioritizes feature similarity and frame dissimilarity, enhances the agent’s ability to identify the keyframes. Anisotropic diffusion is applied to US images to enhance bright bony regions, before feature extraction and representativeness calculation. Frame similarity calculations are parallelized to reduce computational complexity, storage demands and simplify the classification task by focusing solely on frames indicative of fractures. On a dataset of 114 patients, the proposed classification network achieved an accuracy of 88.8% with a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 86.6% using the RL-generated video summaries. Our primary focus is on enhancing sensitivity to ensure that no fractured cases are missed. This performance surpasses the 84.4% accuracy achieved with full video classification. AI-driven ultrasound, with its efficiency, and reduced computational demands, provides a promising solution for early disease detection in resource-constrained environments.Clinical relevance— This AI-driven fast, cost-effective ultrasound tool achieves high accuracy and sensitivity while reducing training time by 50%, making it suitable for real-time clinical use on low-power devices.

This work proposes a Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM) to address these challenges by modeling degradation data of aged battery cells as a weighted combination of Gaussian components, effectively capturing diverse degradation characteristics of multi-battery datasets. For SOH estimation of test battery cells, even at the beginning-of-life, Bayesian statistics is utilized to adaptively update the parameters of the trained GMM based on newly observed data. The proposed CGMM was trained and tested on a publicly available accelerated aging battery dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that CGMM outperforms benchmark models, showcasing its improved accuracy, adaptability, strong generalizability, and reliable uncertainty quantification."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of the operation of a photovoltaic (PV) inverter unit consisting of three voltage source inverters with synchronous pulse-width modulation (PWM). The inverters are controlled by flexibly adjusting their switching frequency based on the current magnitude of the dc voltage of the corresponding PV strings. Such smooth adjustment of the switching frequency of inverters allows for a reduction in harmonic distortion of the winding voltage of the power transformer. Continuous and discontinuous schemes of synchronous space-vector PWM for smooth regulation of inverters are investigated. Simulation results are provided to verify the analyzed control and modulation strategy."

    "abstract": "Batteries are essential components in various applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS), and they operate under a wide range of environmental conditions. These batteries are highly sensitive to temperature changes. At high temperatures, accelerated aging and reduced stability can occur, while at low temperatures, undesirable side reactions such as reduced output and slower diffusion may arise. To ensure optimal performance and safety, it is crucial to maintain battery operation within an ideal temperature range of 15-35°C. This study aims to quantitatively analyze the heat generation characteristics of batteries prior to designing an effective cooling system. To evaluate the initial characteristics of the battery, Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) tests were conducted. In addition, reversible heat generation—one of the key factors influencing thermal behavior—was analyzed to support the development of advanced thermal management strategies."

    "abstract": "Mechanomyography (MMG) is a promising tool for measuring muscle activity in the field but its sensitivity to motion artifacts limits its application. In this study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative noise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG signal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional band-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion recomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.907 and 0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts dynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional method. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the trunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached with great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though their exact quantity still needs to be quantified."

    "abstract": "Handrim propulsion is the main means of independent mobility with manual wheelchairs. Biomechanical studies have indicated that manual propulsion exposes the users to the risk of injuries due to the loads on the upper limbs. Wheelchair configuration and the use of accessories may affect propulsion efficiency by altering total mass and weight distribution. This study explores the effect of using wheelchair hanging storage bags on manual propulsion forces and kinematics. Twenty participants performed two mobility tasks – straight motion and circular trajectory – in four different wheelchair configurations: conventional; and with a hanging storage bag with 5kg in front of the seat, behind the backrest and on the rear wheel spokes. Propulsion forces and motion data were collected with the Smartwheel, an instrumented wheel that is attached in substitution of the regular wheel. In general, the results showed that the addition of a 5kg bag and the place it was installed both affected propulsion forces and kinematics. In the start-up phase of the straight motion, propulsion forces were higher with the bag attached in front of the seat (79.43N first push, 83.62N 3rd push) and lower in the standard (55N 1st push, 56.26N 3rd), while in the steady-state motion both average (45.60N) and peak (64.14N) forces were greater with the bag attached on the rear wheel rim. Kinematic data – propulsion frequency, velocity and push angle – were also influenced by the added mass and its place but with greater variation of the results. The current study provides additional knowledge on the effect of using accessories on manual wheelchair propulsion efficiency. Wheelchair users, provisioners and therapists should consider the potential effect that using – and where to attach - accessories on the wheelchair may impose on propulsion efficiency and the biomechanical loads for the user.Clinical Relevance— Understanding how weight distribution impacts manual wheelchair propulsion is important to optimize mobility performance and reducing physical strain of wheelchhair users. This study highlights how added weight position influences propulsion effort and maneuverability, providing knowledge that may support clinicians in prescribing and customizing wheelchairs."

    "abstract": "This paper assesses the operational performance of a mixed hybrid (ferrite + rare-earth (RE)) permanent magnet (PM) asymmetric (MHPMA) interior PM synchronous machine (IPMSM) against a benchmark REPM-based symmetrical IPMSM (S-IPMSM), considering the influence of different cooling strategies, including jacket cooling (JC) and oil spray cooling (OSC). The continuous torque capabilities of both IPMSMs are evaluated over the full speed range using finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics, accounting for thermal constraints of the REPMs and winding insulation, as well as PWM-induced losses. In addition to steady-state conditions, the thermal analysis is extended to transient operations to evaluate temperature profiles during city, freeway, and hybrid (city + freeway) driving cycles. It is found that significantly reduced RE PM eddy current losses in MHPMA-IPMSM allow for the relief of REPM thermal stress under steady-state operation, using only JC, whereas the S-IPMSM requires additional OSC for similar high-speed performances. Furthermore, across various driving cycles, the MHPMA-IPMSM maintains comparatively lower REPM and end-winding temperatures, effectively mitigating thermal stress in electric vehicle applications and suggesting a potentially longer operational lifespan and enhanced reliability."

    "abstract": "As the demand for ubiquitous connectivity and high-precision environmental awareness grows, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Intelligent metasurfaces (IMs) have also been widely adopted in ISAC scenarios due to their efficient, programmable control over electromagnetic waves. This provides a versatile solution that meets the dual-function requirements of next-generation networks. Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively studied for manipulating the propagation channel between base and mobile stations, the full potential of IMs in ISAC transceiver design remains under-explored. Against this backdrop, this article explores emerging IM-enabled transceiver designs for ISAC systems. It begins with an overview of representative IM architectures, their unique principles, and their inherent advantages in EM wave manipulation. Next, a unified ISAC framework is established to systematically model the design and derivation of diverse IM-enabled transceiver structures. This lays the foundation for performance optimization, trade-offs, and analysis. The paper then discusses several critical technologies for IM-enabled ISAC transceivers, including dedicated channel modeling, effective channel estimation, tailored beamforming strategies, and dual-functional waveform design."

    "abstract": "In last-mile logistics, robust delivery zone partitioning is critical for ensuring timely service and maintaining a positive courier experience. However, existing network-structured spatial partitioning strategies often fail to address heterogeneous uncertainties in both delivery demand and courier supply. In particular, two challenges remain: <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(i)</b> irregular demand patterns with weak periodicity, and <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(ii)</b> stochastic courier availability. To this end, we propose the Prediction and Sampling Then Optimization (PSTO) paradigm, which integrates hybrid uncertainty modeling with Monte Carlo optimization. Specifically, we implement a model named <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RobustDZP</monospace>, which combines time-series prediction with residual learning for demand estimation, a multi-agent RL sampler for supply estimation, and an iterative perturb-and-vote algorithm for partition optimization. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset from JD Logistics demonstrate that our approach improves delivery timeliness by over 16.3% and significantly outperforms baselines under stress tests. Furthermore, we present a real-world case study to validate the practical effectiveness of our framework and highlight key lessons for designing robust and well-received partition schemes."

    "abstract": "At present, deep face recognition models working on millions of images are confronted with the challenge that such large-scale datasets are often corrupted with noises and mislabeled identities yet most deep models are primarily designed for clean datasets. In this paper, we propose a robust deep face recognition model by exploiting the advantage of integrating the strength of margin-based learning models with the strength of mining-based approaches to effectively mitigate the impact of noises during training. By monitoring the recognition performances at a batch level to provide optimization-oriented feedback, we introduce a noise-adaptive mining strategy to dynamically adjust the emphasis balance between hard and noise samples, enabling direct training on noisy datasets without the requirement of pre-training. With a novel anti-noise loss function, learning is empowered for direct and robust training on noisy datasets yet its effectiveness over clean datasets is still preserved, sustaining effective mining of both clean and noisy samples whilst weakening its learning intensiveness over noisy samples. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) our proposed achieves competitive performances in comparison with representative existing SoTA models when trained with clean datasets; (ii) when trained with both real-world and synthesized noisy datasets, our proposed significantly outperforms the existing models, especially when the synthesized datasets are corrupted with both close-set and open-set noises; (iii) while the existing deep models suffer from an average performance drop of around 20% over noise-corrupted large scale datasets, our proposed still delivers accuracy rates of more than 95%.

    "abstract": "Phantoms are essential for assessing PET system performance, but most existing brain phantoms do not provide the anatomical fidelity required for the next-generation high-resolution PET systems. To address this limitation, we developed HYDRA-OL (HYDrodynamically filled Realistic Anatomy of the Occipital Lobe) phantoms using high-resolution 3D printing based on the BigBrain atlas. In this study, two phantom types were created, HYDRA-OLG (gray matter only) and HYDRA-OLGW (gray and white matter), enabling contrast modulation between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). Precise anatomical fidelity and repositioning accuracy were confirmed via CT. A custom closed-loop filling apparatus ensured efficient and reproducible phantom preparation. Residual air in the phantom after 15 minutes was estimated to be less than 0.01% of the fillable space. To compare spatial resolution between scanners, the HYDRA-OLG phantom was imaged on four different PET systems (NeuroEXPLORER (NX), HRRT, Vision, and Focus220), with NX and Focus showing superior spatial resolution compared to the other two systems. To generate variable GM:WM contrast, list mode datasets obtained on the NX for both HYDRA-OLG and HYDRA-OLGW phantoms were down-sampled and merged to form one list mode data. Reconstructed images were successfully produced with GM:WM contrast ratio of 4:1, 2:1, and 4:3. Overall, the HYDRA phantom platform is a versatile tool for accurately representing human brain anatomy. It is likely to be more useful than previous phantoms for evaluating image resolution and optimizing reconstruction parameters for next-generation brain PET systems."

    "abstract": "In Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) cooperative localization (CL), due to the variation of sensor performance with the environment, it is difficult to determine the accurate noise covariance, and the measurement noise may be time-varying with heavy tails. At the same time, in underwater acoustic communication, delays and packet loss occur randomly, which limits the reliability and accuracy of the CL system. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new robust CL filtering algorithm that can handle time-varying delays/losses measurements and unknown non-stationary non-Gaussian noise. First, a new integrated framework for measurement loss detection and compensation in CL system has been established. Then, the probability density function (PDF) of the measurement likelihood with measurement loss/delay and non-Gaussian noise is modeled as a mixture of two skewed Gaussian (MTSG) distributions. Furthermore, a VB(Variational Bayes)-based method was proposed to achieve the state estimation of the system, treating the state, noise covariance matrix, and auxiliary random variables as estimation variables, while using the inverse Wishart distribution to model the unknown noise covariance matrix, addressing the impact of imprecise noise statistical information on the system. Finally, real lake experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm."

This study addresses two fundamental limitations of MRI-based diagnosis: the inherent class imbalance and resolution variations. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-refining framework that integrates three key innovations: (1) panoptic segmentation for unified representation of tumors and brain anatomy, (2) patch-wise cross-modality attention enabling adaptive feature fusion from multi-modal MRI, and (3) a dynamic loss function that automatically rebalances learning to prioritize rare tumor subtypes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, demonstrating consistent superiority over existing architectures while maintaining robustness to varying image resolutions. These technical advances can translate to clinical benefits, including improved detection of diagnostically challenging cases, anatomically plausible tumor segmentation for surgical planning, and reduced dependence on uniformly high-resolution scans, making the framework particularly valuable for real-world clinical deployment."

However, the effectiveness of MMT heavily depends on the availability of extensive collections of bilingual parallel sentence pairs and manually annotated images, which poses a challenge due to the scarcity of such pairs. To address this issue, we propose incorporating the Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) for data augmentation in MMT. By utilizing MMKG as an additional source of knowledge, we can overcome the limitations of existing sentence-image pairings. This allows us to expand the original parallel corpus and generate corresponding images, creating new synthetic data pairs that facilitate effective data augmentation. Experiments conducted on two translation datasets, Multi30k and IKEA, demonstrate that the proposed MMKG enhancement method significantly improves performance across multiple baseline methods, ultimately outperforming all baseline approaches. Additionally, experiments under low-resource conditions reveal that our method achieves exceptional enhancement effects in low-resource corpora, surpassing other data augmentation baseline methods. These results indicate the efficacy and potential of the proposed method for enhancing the performance of multimodal models across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) captures 3D hyperspectral images (HSIs) in a single shot by encoding incident light into 2D measurements. However, recovering the original hyperspectral data from these measurements is a severely ill-posed inverse problem due to significant information loss during compression. Recent deep learning methods, especially deep unfolding networks, have demonstrated promising reconstruction results by embedding learnable priors into iterative optimization frameworks. However, most existing approaches use a single network to jointly estimate spatial and spectral priors, limiting their ability to handle the distinct properties of HSIs. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Prior Decoupling Model (SSPD), which reformulates HSI reconstruction as a prior absorption problem, enabling independent modeling of spatial and spectral priors with specialized network architectures. To achieve this, we design two attention mechanisms tailored for hyperspectral data: one for capturing spatial correlations and another for preserving spectral signatures. Additionally, we develop a hybrid loss function that combines convergence constraints and cross-prior interactions, ensuring accurate prior fusion and stable reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that SSPD outperforms existing methods in spectral snapshot compressive imaging."

    "abstract": "Despite demonstrating superior Rate-Distortion (RD) performance, Learning-based Image Compression (LIC) algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to malicious perturbations in recent studies. However, the adversarial attacks considered in existing literature remain divergent from real-world scenarios, both in terms of the attack direction and bitrate. Additionally, existing methods focus solely on empirical observations of the model vulnerability, neglecting to identify the origin of it. These limitations hinder the comprehensive investigation and in-depth understanding of the adversarial robustness of LIC algorithms. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper considers the arbitrary nature of the attack direction and the uncontrollable compression ratio faced by adversaries, and presents two practical rate-distortion attack paradigms, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>, Specific-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (SRDA) and Agnostic-ratio Rate-Distortion Attack (ARDA). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct joint rate-distortion attacks on LIC algorithms.

    "abstract": "This article treats the problems of the stability, boundedness, and stabilizing control of discrete-time semi-Markov jump systems (SMJSs) with fragmentary semi-Markov kernel (SMK) under persistent disturbances. Since the statistical characteristics of stochastic processes are difficult to describe precisely and comprehensively, the available SMK information may be fragmentary, and only a portion of the information is known. Regarding this problem, we propose new approaches that leverage all the known SMK information and derive new criteria for analysis and control. The feasibility therein can be enhanced compared to the existing approaches with inadequate utilization of the known SMK information. Additionally, a polytopic approach is proposed to approximate the unknown portion of the SMK information to enrich the information available for subsequent analysis and control design. This is achieved through constructing a polytopic quadratic Lyapunov-like function (LF), which further improves the feasibility. In this way, both the available information and the approximated unknown part about the SMK are incorporated. Meanwhile, the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop semi-Markov jump linear system (SMJLS) is ensured in the mean-square sense without requiring the deviation between the state and its nominal one to converge at all times. We illustrate the validity and superiority of the proposed approach through a numerical example and a simulated chemical process example using a machine learning-based surrogate model."

However, their increasing complexity has resulted in enormous processing and memory requirements. Although most optimization attempts have been on linear calculations, non-linear functions such as Softmax, and the massive memory footprint of dense weights are increasingly taking over inference speed, particularly for lengthy sequences and multi-dimensional inputs. In this letter, we address this gap and propose an optimal FPGA implementation of a Transformer network by utilizing (i) axial-wise parallel attention computation to minimize buffering and maximize parallelism, (ii) a hardware-efficient SoftMax unit implementing PLA-based exponent approximation, and (iii) binary masking to minimize memory footprint and energy consumption. Our analysis shows that model efficiency is maintained while computational complexity is reduced. This method greatly increases computing and energy efficiency by 3.95% to 62.1% compared to similar FPGA-based solutions."

    "abstract": "To suppress transient voltage spikes across the ac-side MOSFET in cycloconverter-based dc–ac converters, this article proposes a secondary-side modulation (SSM) method that synchronizes MOSFET turn-<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">off</small> with the channel current zero-crossing. This synchronization minimizes body-diode conduction time, thereby suppressing the transient voltage spikes. The method enhances design flexibility by enabling the use of Si MOSFETs with lower breakdown voltage and lower on-resistance, while relaxing constraints on transformer leakage inductance—all without additional clamping circuits. Experimental results on a 300 W prototype demonstrate a 110 V reduction in peak transient voltage with a 950 V Si MOSFET. The suppressed voltage stress further allows for the adoption of a 650 V Si MOSFET, achieving a peak efficiency of 94.18% at 110 V/50 Hz output. Thus, the proposed SSM offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for cycloconverter-based dc–ac converters in photovoltaic and other industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major electricity end-use with a substantial potential for providing grid services, such as demand response. Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, a difficult task because nonlinear heat transfer and recurring daily cycles make historical data highly correlated and insufficient to generalize to new weather, occupancy, and control scenarios. This paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. Unlike traditional training approaches that minimize prediction errors, we employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) to learn the NN parameters with the objective of directly improving the HVAC cost performance. However, the discrete nature of MIQP hinders DFL, as it leads to undefined and discontinuous gradients, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. We leverage Stochastic Smoothing (SS) to enable efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional identify-then-optimize (i.e., the thermal dynamics model is identified on historical data then used in optimization) and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-aware building control."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the consensus-based distributed secondary control problem for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) under False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). To solve this issue, the proposed solution consists of a novel Digital Twin (DT) framework, which introduces a key innovation: a unique design where the control equations of the Physical Entity (PE) and the Virtual Model (VM) converge to the same state under normal conditions but diverge in the presence of an attack. Based on frequency and voltage amplitude, residual indices are leveraged to identify discrepancies between the PE and VM. These indices are computed locally by the local controller (LC) placed in each DER that comprises the isolated AC microgrid (MG) considered in this research effort. The main characteristic of the proposal is that only the residual indices associated with the attacked DER units differ from zero, which enables the diagnostics of the attack and the isolation of the affected DER units. This design enables the system to isolate compromised consensus variables—used for active and reactive power-sharing— without interference during normal operations. These proposed residual indices are robust to disturbances such as load changes, ensuring false-positive-free diagnostic signals. Extensive simulations under various attack scenarios, including isolated and coordinated attacks, validate the residual generation framework, demonstrating precise isolation of the attacked DERs."

Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) is a method that uses list-mode positron emission tomography (PET) data to localize moving particles non-invasively inside opaque systems. However, while the application of this method to <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> cell tracking has previously been evoked, its implementation has been limited to tracking one cell at a time. This study investigates the feasibility of tracking multiple cells simultaneously using a recently developed expectation maximization (EM) algorithm called PEPT-EM. The primary challenge to the translation of this algorithm towards biomedical applications is the low radioactivity of the cells being tracked. We experimentally demonstrated the performance of the PEPT-EM algorithm using a preclinical PET scanner for tracking droplets and cells with activities ranging from tens to hundreds of Bq, in phantoms and in a murine model. We found that while background and multiplexing effects impact static source tracking, sensitivity is critical for dynamic tracking of moving sources. We successfully localized multiple single cells in a murine model, moving at speeds up to 25 mm/s, marking the first use of PEPT-EM for such applications. Our findings highlight the exciting potential of PEPT for real-time, high throughput tracking of multiple single cells <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>, paving the way for studying cell tracking in biological systems."

The proposed hexagonal-shaped HFT is constructed using multiple U26/22/16 ferrite cores and is designed to operate at high switching frequencies. Unlike conventional designs, both the primary and secondary windings are wound around the central limbs, enabling precise control of leakage inductance and eliminating the need for bulky auxiliary inductors in DC-DC dual active bridge (DAB) converters. In addition, the design integrates SiC MOSFETs, gate drivers, and a heat sink directly within the magnetic assembly, thereby reducing packaging volume and achieving a more compact converter structure. The electromagnetic characteristics of the HFT are analyzed using three-dimensional finite-element simulations in COMSOL, with results showing close agreement with design predictions. A prototype has been fabricated and experimentally validated, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for high-power converter applications."

    "abstract": "In learned image compression (LIC), most existing methods process spatial domain information through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformers. However, they struggle to model frequency-domain correlations, particularly high-frequency detail correlations across regions. They suffer from high-frequency detail redundancy and inefficient uniform bit allocation, neither of which adapts to regional complexity. To address these issues, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Transformer Network (SFTNet) for LIC, which models cross-domain correlations between spatial structures and frequency components to enable region-adaptive bit allocation. To model these correlations, the Frequency-aware Transformer Block (FATB) employs dual attention mechanisms to collaboratively process spatial and frequency components. Specifically, its intra-block frequency attention enhances high-frequency details within each block by using low-frequency components as local structural guidance. Meanwhile, its inter-block spatial attention captures global consistency by modeling cross-block dependencies among low-frequency components. Building on this, the Feature Re-weighting Strategy (FRS) evaluates block importance via joint analysis of spatial dependencies and high-frequency energy. This enables dynamic alignment of the spatial-frequency features modeled by FATB for adaptive bit allocation, prioritizing structurally complex regions and compressing smooth areas to reduce redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our SFTNet outperforms VVC by −6.55% and −6.18% in BD-Rate on Kodak and CLIC datasets while achieving better reconstruction quality of the high-frequency details compared to recent LIC methods."

To exploit the favorable propagation condition and inherent sparsity of massive MIMO channel induced by antenna array enlargement and sporadic user activity, we develop a covariance-based compressed sensing framework, in which a generalized truncated spike-and-slab prior is formulated to model the covariance signal, and two low-complexity Gibbs sampling (GS) strategies are proposed to numerically approximate the hyperparameters. First, a block GS (BGS) algorithm is developed by splitting the target signal into multiple sub-blocks and performing block-wise sampling in low-dimensional spaces. Then, a covariance-free BGS (CoFe-BGS) algorithm is proposed to reduce the complexity of matrix inversion in the block sampling procedure. The computational advantages of BGS and CoFe-BGS are supported by complexity analysis. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the standard GS method and other counterparts."

Currently, high spatial resolution SSM estimation primarily relies on machine learning methods. However, in heterogeneous environments, the challenges associated with hyperparameter optimization, computational efficiency and uncertainty control compromise the robustness of these methods. To address this issue, this study introduces and evaluates an integrated strategy that combines Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimization (GP-BO) with machine learning for high-resolution SSM retrieval. The results demonstrate that the combined method significantly outperforms conventional optimization methods evaluated by the test sets from Heihe River Basin, Naqu, and Shandian River basins. Notably, the integration of GP-BO with XGBoost turned out to be the optimal combination, improving R² by 0.01–0.19 and reducing ubRMSE by 0.02–1.71 percentage points relative to conventional optimizers, while requiring the least training time for ensemble models. Furthermore, vegetation-specific GP-BO-tuned XGBoost models achieve varying degrees of accuracy improvement and reduced uncertainty across various vegetation, particularly in barren and grassland regions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GP-BO hyperparameter optimization algorithm in reducing the uncertainties of SSM estimation in heterogeneous environments."

Participants completed the Heel-To-Shin test (HST) for CA evaluation while using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) incorporated in the BioKin™ system affixed to their leg to capture the movement. The resultant kinematic parameters were quantitatively analysed to identify movements that are characteristic of each phenotype.

Several feature subsets were explored for two sets of phenotypic groupings to generate a classification model to correctly identify each phenotype. The performance was evaluated based on macro-averaged F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve. The MLP classifier model performed best in classifying the CA+BV+SS phenotype, with a class-specific F1 score of 0.67 and an overall F1 score of 0.74 and ROC-AUC score of 0.81.

In Romania, preschool teachers face increasing demands to provide inclusive, innovative, and child-centered learning, yet opportunities for systematic continuing professional development (CPD) remain uneven. CPD has the potential to not only enhance professional knowledge and skills but also to strengthen teachers' sense of self-efficacy and psychological wellbeing. This study examines the impact of CPD programs on three interrelated outcomes: professional performance, wellbeing, and self-efficacy. Guided by human capital theory, Bandura's self-efficacy framework, and the Job Demands-Resources model, the research investigates whether participation in CPD yields measurable professional benefits for preschool teachers. A mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative data were collected from 65 preschool teachers using validated Likert-type scales that measured professional performance, wellbeing, and self-efficacy. Statistical analyses included Pearson correlations and multiple regression models. The qualitative component involved a thematic analysis of open-ended responses, focusing on teachers' perceptions of CPD relevance, support mechanisms, and barriers to effective implementation in practice. Teachers reported attending an average of four CPD programs in the last three years, with workshops and mentoring sessions being most valued. Quantitative analysis revealed significant positive associations between CPD and professional performance, wellbeing, and self-efficacy. Regression analysis confirmed self-efficacy as the strongest predictor of performance, explaining 58% of the variance in performance outcomes. Thematic analysis highlighted the importance of training relevance, opportunities for collaborative reflection, and leadership support in maximizing CPD benefits."

In recent years, Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FCS-MPC) has been investigated as a potential solution to mitigate these challenges. Nevertheless, for <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8 / 6$</tex> SRMs, conventional implementations employ an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha \\beta$</tex> transformation that does not preserve power invariance, leading to non-uniform vector distributions in the control plane.

    "abstract": "Purely mechanically driven haptic feedback systems utilise hydro-mechanical forces applied to a fingertip sensor to increase internal fluid pressure, activating the membrane of a feedback actuator and generating tactile sensations. This paper presents the design, fabrication, as well as verification, and validation of an integrated haptic feedback system in a body-powered partial hand prosthesis. We implemented the mechano-tactile haptic feedback mechanism in a Naked Prosthetics device, specially fabricated for a patient with small finger and ring finger amputations. Verification experiments were conducted to characterise the physical interaction between the custom-designed fingertips and the soft membrane of the feedback actuators. We also validated the haptic feedback system in a clinical trial setting with an amputee, demonstrating its practical application and effectiveness. The evaluation included objective performance metrics, such as task completion time, alongside subjective assessments of the tactile haptic feedback experienced by the user. The results demonstrate that the integration of mechano-tactile feedback into the body-powered prosthesis was perceptible to the user and moderately improved the time required to complete daily tasks."

    "abstract": "Music playing engages the autonomic nervous system and affects the cardiovascular system. Understanding the interaction between playing and cardiovascular response requires measuring cardiovascular signals in ways that do not limit musicians’ actions. Noise due to movements and nonstandard electrode placements may also constrain the analysis of ECG signal morphologies, requiring methods that eliminate the need for precise fiducial point annotation. One promising approach is the Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) method, which converts periodic time series into a two-dimensional map called an attractor. This study applies the SPAR method to musicians’ ECG signals, enabling visualisation and classification of signal morphologies. A professional trio—violinist, cellist, and pianist—rehearses Schubert’s Trio No. 2, Op. 100, Andante con moto nine times. Their ECG signals are segmented based on the musicians’ annotated prosodic structures. The results show clear differences between attractors during prosodic structures and those during the baseline. Hierarchical clustering of attractor density profiles first separates the data by musician, then by performance state (baseline vs. music), and finally by the type of musical action. When comparing performances over time, a significant negative correlation is found between baseline and music states in string players. This suggests a reduction in attractor distance, indicating physiological adaptation over time. Our study introduces SPAR as a robust way to analyse ECG morphology during music performance and link attractor patterns with prosodic action types.Clinical relevance—Music-based interventions present valuable potential as safe, adjunctive cardiovascular treatment to conventional therapies. Music engagement, both active and receptive, modulates the autonomic nervous system. Robust methods for representing and understanding the physiological dynamics of music making is an important step towards applying music-based interventions in real-world settings."

Typically, each sensor system possesses its own dedicated and sometimes limited units for data logging and communication. To improve versatility, we introduce a platform capable of interfacing with a broad spectrum of external or implanted sensors, providing real-time signal processing and wireless transmission. The system’s versatility stems from its modular design. This paper describes this platform, outlines the prototype’s characteristics, and illustrates its potential application with a variety of physiological sensors. We further show that this compact device can be either used externally or as a subcutaneous implant after encasing it in the appropriate material.Clinical relevance— While this prototype is not intended to be a medical device, it has substantial clinical potential provided further development. It could offer a replacement for bulky and wired systems, thereby improving the working conditions of healthcare personnel. Furthermore, the in vivo animal experiments demonstrate the potential of this system for implantation, either as a short- to medium-term diagnostic device or possibly as a more permanent solution for continuous monitoring."

Most existing studies on stealthy attacks focus on CPS with linear plants. This paper investigates a kind of stealthy attacks called mirror attacks on CPS with nonlinear plants. The idea is to replace the true sensor output signals with the simulated outputs computed based on the adversarial nonlinear plant model and the control input signals calculated by the controller. It is demonstrated that, with the help of joint state and parameter estimation, a mirror attack can manipulate the states of nonlinear plants while remaining stealthy, even with an inaccurate plant model. To illustrate the threat of mirror attacks, experiments have been carried out on the well-established nonlinear three-tank system."

It employs a six-segment space vector modulation technique, where two nonzero vectors and one zero vector are symmetrically arranged. By varying the vector application sequence, four candidate synthesized vectors are formed. The optimal candidate vector is adaptively selected by minimizing current trajectory tracking errors. The effectiveness of the proposal is validated via comparative experiments."

    "abstract": "Stroke can lead to changes in the structure and functional brain networks, severely affecting patients' daily lives. Electroacupuncture, a combination of traditional acupuncture and electrical stimulation, can serve as an alternative therapy for stroke rehabilitation. Assessing the neurophysiological changes associated with electroacupuncture in patients helps to explore the mechanisms by which electroacupuncture affects stroke. However, current studies mainly rely on static EEG features for evaluation, which may lose relevant information in the temporal dimension. To fill this gap, we used EEG microstate analysis to comprehensively assess the changes in brain activity of stroke patients before, during, and after electroacupuncture. The results showed that, compared with before electroacupuncture, the duration, occurrence, and coverage of EEG microstates B and E changed during and after electroacupuncture. In addition, the observed-expected transition probability from microstate B to E was significantly different before and during electroacupuncture, and the observed-expected transition probability from microstate D to A after electroacupuncture was significantly higher than before electroacupuncture. Taken together, the microstates B and E may serve as objective biomarkers of electroacupuncture.Clinical Relevance— EEG microstates can serve as novel biomarkers to reflect the neuromodulation effects of electroacupuncture on stroke patients."

Our study utilized a VR system (combining a virtual acoustic environment with an omni-directional locomotion device) to evaluate blind football players' auditory spatial cognition and walking accuracy.Experiments confirmed that blind football experience significantly impacts both auditory spatial awareness and movement accuracy. Experienced players (sighted and visually impaired) demonstrated superior movement into auditory-cued spaces compared to novices. Notably, experienced visually impaired players maintained high accuracy without real-time auditory information, suggesting robust internal spatial representations. Conversely, experienced sighted players showed significantly smaller walking errors with real-time auditory cues, indicating their reliance on continuous spatial updating.These findings are crucial for understanding movement in visually impaired individuals. The VR evaluation method holds potential as a new standard for DX-era sports training. We aim to leverage these insights for individualized training support systems for blind football players and rehabilitation programs aiding independent mobility for visually impaired individuals."

The proposed architecture, built on the C2C ladder structure, enables runtime adjustment of the multiplier bit weights from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB), allowing for flexible implementation of mixed-precision ML models. By adjusting the bit position weights of learnable neural network weights, the representable numbers can be tailored to the required precision for a given node or filter in the ML model. To determine the optimal bit weights for our proposed multiplier, we propose a non-uniform quantization-aware training algorithm that trains the multiplier bit weights and fine-tunes the pre-trained ML model weights to utilize the suggested multiplication engine efficiently. We implemented the proposed multiplier in 12nm technology and evaluated its performance on low-bit-width BERT and GPT2 models for eight natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The results show that the 32×32 crossbar of the proposed 4-bit multiplier achieves 100 TOPS/W energy efficiency. Moreover, our proposed analog multiplier achieves scores comparable to those of FP32 models when using 4-bit models, demonstrating its efficacy."

ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, is not prone to convergence issues, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training. A fewshot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available."

The actuator kinetic model was established for the swing and stance phase, and simulation and bench experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of CEA. Compared with the rigid actuator(RA), the simulation results show that the CEA reduces the peak power by 56.56% and the average power by 64.22%, the bench test shows that the CEA reduces the peak power by 47.97% and the average power by 56.33%, providing a reference for the miniaturization and lightweight design of exoskeletons."

    "abstract": "Grid-following converters (GFLCs) play a crucial role in integrating renewable energy sources (RESs) into modern power systems. However, a high penetration of GFLCs can challenge the stability of weak grids with low short-circuit ratios (SCRs), necessitating the installation of grid-forming converters (GFMCs) to improve the grid strength. Although the grid-support capabilities of GFMCs have been well demonstrated in the existing literature, the optimal GFMC capacity configuration for improving stability in hybrid GFMC-GFLC systems remains relatively under-explored. Moreover, GFLCs operating under different reactive power control (RPC) schemes exhibit distinct small-signal behaviors, and it is still unclear how they affect the optimal GFMC capacity required to ensure system stability. To fill this gap, this paper identifies the main causes of instability caused by two GFLC RPC schemes—constant reactive power control (CRPC) and AC voltage control (AVC)—and explains how GFMCs address the source of instability in each case. Furthermore, a GFMC/GFLC capacity configuration strategy is proposed to determine the minimum GFMC capacity required to enhance the small-signal stability of a microgrid. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through real-time simulations."

This increased sensitivity leads to higher current harmonics, resulting in increased machine losses, current distortion, and mechanical vibration. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the high-frequency harmonic losses induced by PWM in a voltage-fed electric machine. A circuit-level simulation framework is performed to evaluate the voltage excitation and the resulting current responses of the motor-inverter system under various PWM strategies. The analysis incorporates field-oriented control (FOC) with the synchronous frame PI current controller, ensuring consistent computational effort and control fidelity across all modulation schemes. To maintain a balanced trade-off between simulation accuracy and computational efficiency, the study combines finite element analysis (FEA) for machine loss estimation with a circuit-based approach for predicting PWM-induced current ripple. An in-depth electromagnetic loss breakdown is carried out to pinpoint the dominant sources of high-frequency losses. Two well established PWM techniques, known for their distinct current distortion profiles, are evaluated across a range of switching frequencies, machine operating speeds, and modulation indices. The analysis emphasizes their impact on current waveform quality and high-frequency loss behavior in the context of aerospace propulsion systems."

The proposed motor achieves two distinct forms of force enhancement through the control of four airgap harmonic fields. First, the motor's force capacity is increased by regulating an additional harmonic, optimizing iron utilization and enabling higher force creation. This approach enhances the force capacity by approximately 40% compared to conventional six-phase designs. Second, force regulation is improved by utilizing two additional harmonics to create suspension forces, enabling independent suspension and motoring operation. A multi-objective optimization is conducted to identify a high-performance design, followed by prototyping and simulation and experimental validation.

However, previous studies have only explored the effectiveness of temporal and spatial neural networks individually. In this study, we compare the performance of spatial and temporal neural networks to identify MU activities in real time. Both neural networks comprise the convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting spatial information and the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) module for extracting temporal information, respectively. We further explored their performance under different training samples. Both simulated and experimental HD-sEMG recordings with an 8 × 8 electrode array from abductor pollicis brevis muscle were used to validate the methods. The MU spike trains identified offline using the automatic progressive FastICA peel-off algorithm were employed to train the neural network, which can then perform the online HD-sEMG decomposition on the unseen HD-sEMG data. Results demonstrated that the Bi-GRU method outperformed CNN method, achieving higher matching rate in both simulated and experimental data. Moreover, both methods achieved poor performance with less amount of training data. This study highlights the importance of exploiting temporal information of HD-sEMG and the amount of training data for DL-based MU identification, providing valuable insights into optimizing model design and improving decomposition performance."

    "abstract": "Previous work has found that simple linear time varying (LTV) models constructed using Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) can recreate intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals from complex epileptogenic networks. However, depending on a variety of factors such as the network size, the preprocessing techniques applied, and the dynamics captured within a window, these models may frequently contain unstable eigenvalues, resulting in diverging reconstructions even within short windows of interest. In this paper, we compare four alternative model construction methods to OLS with the aim of both stabilizing the models and improving the signal reconstruction quality. We found that these alternative methods decreased the percentage of diverging reconstructions, but that some methods require careful parameter optimization to prevent over stabilization and converging reconstructions. Through systematic comparison of the effects of the model construction method on both the network connectivity estimates and the model reconstructed iEEG time series, we can now tailor the LTV model construction method for specific applications and use the models generated in downstream analyses to assist with seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization.Clinical Relevance— The use of computational models to model brain network connectivity and reliably reconstruct intracranial neural signals without requiring extensive invasive recordings has the potential to further advance our understanding of epileptogenic networks, improve SOZ localization accuracy and efficiency, and thus improve treatment outcomes for drug-resistant epilepsy patients."

    "abstract": "In high current power electronics applications, power transistors are often connected in parallel to enhance the efficiency and achieve higher system power. When connecting power transistors in parallel, resonant circuits caused by the parasitic parameters of the printed circuit board (PCB) and the transistor itself occur. These resonant circuits cause oscillations, resulting in higher switching losses or even damage to the device. This paper describes an approach to detect and suppress oscillations when connecting two gallium nitride (GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs) in parallel. The analytical model shows the influence of parameter variation of source- and gate inductance on system stability. The simulation model verifies that parameter variation can strongly influence the oscillation behavior of the system. Finally, a hardware demonstrator is used to evaluate the analytical model and the simulation model."

    "abstract": "In industrial lubrication systems, oil serves as the primary lubricant, protecting components from damage. Accurate oil flow monitoring, including precise drop counting, is essential for optimizing lubrication, preventing machinery damage from under-lubrication, and reducing costly and environmentally harmful oil wastage. Previous methods addressing counting oil drops either relied on manual counting, which is error-prone and inefficient, or flow meters, which, while automated, are often costly and require frequent calibration. Camera-based systems offer a promising alternative with benefits in both cost and accuracy. In this paper, we present an automated approach for counting drops in industrial lubrication systems using video input. Our method employs convolutional template matching for the initial detection of oil cans within each frame and optical flow to track motion and count oil drops. We evaluate the method on a set of videos, demonstrating a 22% error rate in drop counting. The results show that while the system achieves reasonable accuracy, further improvements are needed to reduce the error rate and enhance reliability across varied video conditions."

    "abstract": "Litz wire is used in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems due to its low losses and high quality factor. However, with the bundling and twisting architecture of litz strands, estimating the AC resistance with high accuracy becomes chal-lenging. The 3-dimensional finite element analysis (3D-FEA) is one of the accurate methods to calculate the AC resistance of the WPT coils, but requires high computational cost and simulation time. Analytical models are an alternative method for fast estimation of the AC resistance of WPT coils. However, existing analytical models for the Litz wire ignore the twisting and bundling effects, leading to high computational errors. This paper presents a semi-analytical model to calculate the AC resistance of the WPT coils with good accuracy and low computational time. The proposed model can predict AC resistance with errors up to 8% and is validated with different prototypes of WPT coil hardware results."

A promising approach to enhance dietary monitoring in everyday life involves automated detection of food intake gestures. This study introduces a skeleton based approach using a model that combines a dilated spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) framework, as called ST-GCN-BiLSTM, to detect intake gestures. The skeleton-based method provides key benefits, including environmental robustness, reduced data dependency, and enhanced privacy preservation. Two datasets were employed for model validation. The OREBA dataset, which consists of laboratory-recorded videos, achieved segmental F1-scores of 86.18% and 74.84% for identifying eating and drinking gestures. Additionally, a self-collected dataset using smartphone recordings in more adaptable experimental conditions was evaluated with the model trained on OREBA, yielding F1scores of 85.40% and 67.80% for detecting eating and drinking gestures. The results not only confirm the feasibility of utilizing skeleton data for intake gesture detection but also highlight the robustness of the proposed approach in cross-dataset validationClinical relevance—This skeleton-based intake gesture detection system can serve as an automated annotation tool for nutritional experts, facilitating the analysis of participants’ eating behaviors."

This paper focuses on unraveling the best preprocessing scheme to be used when dealing with the classification of uterine muscular contraction signals. In addition, the study discusses the impact of several EHG denoising techniques on the prediction outcome. Hypergraph neural network (HGNN) is employed to evaluate the different preprocessing steps. The results show that it is better to start by segmenting the contractions and concatenating them, then standardizing the resulting signal or normalizing it between -1 and 1, and finally segmenting the contractions again in order to characterize them by a set of features that are used to finally train the classifier. The accuracy achieved by the HGNN given this methodology was 89.2%. Moreover, the use of the conventional EHG denoising methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and their combination (EMD-CCA) did not improve the prediction results. As a conclusion, proper preprocessing of the EHG signals would lead to a great improvement in the prediction process.Clinical Relevance— This study presents a new effective approach for preprocessing EHG signals to improve the prediction of delivery term."

However, non-isolated DC excitation sources are vulnerable to overcurrent and overvoltage impacts from the AC side. Additionally, a larger DC bias magnetomotive force reduces the core magnetic flux within the linear region of the actual operating range, thereby impairing the transient current limiting performance. The novel contribution of paper lie in proposing a saturated core fault current limiting technology based on control and protection cooperation (CPCFCL). This CPCFCL features advantages such as steady-state power flow control, the transient function of cutting off DC excitation. Firstly, the topology and operating mechanism of the CPCFCL are established, followed by an analysis of key transient parameters of its excitation system. Subsequently, a 500 kV simulation model is constructed using finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, the advantages and disadvantages between CPCFCL and SCFCL are compared, and the technical challenges in 500kV HVAC system practical application of CPCFCL are analyzed."

    "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a common disorder characterized by episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) cessation of breathing during sleep. Apneas may result from upper airway obstruction (obstructive apnea) or reduced respiratory effort (central apnea). Although expert scoring is the clinical standard, significant inter-and intra-rater variability has spurred the development of automated detection methods. In this work, we propose a method to segment respiratory modalities from nocturnal polysomnography into individual breaths and to classify each breath as obstructive apnea, central apnea, hy-popnea, or normal. Using recordings from 1,315 subjects in the MESA sleep study, we developed a Hilbert transform–based segmentation algorithm to segment individual breaths from polysomnography data, then we trained a model for per-breath apnea classification. Our results demonstrate that individual breaths can be reliably segmented and that apneic events are detected with an F1 score of 0.47, while normal breathing is classified with an F1 score of 0.95.Clinical relevance: By using breath-specific windowing and thus providing apnea features on a per-breath basis, this approach enables interesting physiological modeling of sleep-disordered breathing. Such detailed analysis may yield novel insights into the underlying pathophysiology of sleep apnea, potentially leading to improved, personalized treatment strategies and better prediction of clinical outcomes."

However, due to unequal irradiance and module mismatches, PV modules generate different amounts of power, leading to a power mismatch among the phases of the CHB converter. If not addressed, this mismatch results in an imbalance in the grid currents. To mitigate this issue, a novel multiport DC-DC converter is proposed for power balancing among CHB converter phases. The proposed converter features zero current switching, minimizing switching losses and provides a multilevel voltage, enhancing power quality. Furthermore, it requires no additional control mechanisms for power balancing, simplifying implementation and reducing operational complexity.

The learned weights from ResNet50, obtained through feature-extraction and knowledge-distillation, are then transferred to the Modified Dense Convolutional Network (MDCN) to enhance its ability to extract meaningful features and improve classification performance. To further optimize the model, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used for automatic hyperparameter tuning. Instead of manually adjusting parameters like batch-size and learning-rate, WOA selects the best values, reducing training time and improving overall accuracy. Results from experimental-simulations suggest that the proposed method achieves 99.45 % accuracy in 40 epochs, outperforming the benchmark algorithms such as proposed algorithm with Grid Search, proposed algorithm without WOA, Dense-Net 121, Resnet50 and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The combination of transfer-learning and optimization helps speed up training while reducing errors."

    "abstract": "In recent years, induction motor drives have often operated at high fundamental-to-switching frequency ratios due to the contradiction between high-speed operating requirements and switching frequency limitations. In such conditions, increasing discretization phase error degrades current control performance due to inaccuracies in conventional discrete-time model. Thus, the phase-error-free discrete-time model has been proposed to address this issue. However, the impact of approximation order on control performance remains unexplored. This study analyzes pole-zero migration in open-loop systems under varying approximation orders and derives an optimal design strategy to balance dynamic performance and computational efficiency. The closed-loop system analysis, simulations, and experiments are carried out to verify the analysis and optimal design strategy."

The multilevel converter is composed of series-connected H-bridge circuits, which can supply a multilevel voltage with reduced voltage ripples. On the other hand, the linear circuit is anti-series MOSFETs operated in a linear mode to eliminate the voltage ripples from the output terminal voltage of the DC-to-AC converter. New control methods are described to regulate the DC-capacitor voltage of each H-bridge circuit for the multilevel converter and to adjust the output current for the linear circuit. Experimental results are shown by using a 100-V 1.6-kW prototype DC-to-AC Converter to verify the validity of the proposed control strategy."

The system is adaptive and intended to be applicable to any patient without prior calibration. We employ an augmented integrated glucose insulin (IGI) model to simulate 278 virtual patients for a virtual trial of the proposed system.

    "abstract": "Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to deliver out-of-hospital care by deploying specialized resources to treat patients. To optimize EMS operations, various models are proposed in literature to predict demand and allocate resources more efficiently. Demand patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including demographics, territorial characteristics, and environmental conditions. In Lombardy region, Northern Italy, the public agency responsible for managing emergency services (AREU) relies on a digital twin of the EMS system, developed in collaboration with the Polytechnic of Milan. While this tool offers significant insights, it involves time-intensive processing, especially for simulating future emergency demand, and does not incorporate critical temporal patterns, such as environmental conditions. This highlights the need for a more efficient model. Hence, this study proposes enhancing the existing digital twin with machine learning techniques to improve demand forecasting, integrating external time-variant factors and reducing processing time. Multiple models are tested and compared, and the performance of the selected one is evaluated, considering error metrics, against real historical emergency data and baseline model. Results demonstrate that the machine learning-enhanced model significantly improves predictive accuracy, reducing RMSE from 8,7 to 2,5 events/hour. This approach also substantially reduces computational time, enabling day-by-day predictions and real-time decision making for EMS deployment and resources optimization. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning to provide valuable insights for policy development, aiming to better align EMS resources with demand dynamics and to ultimately improve emergency response outcomes.Clinical Relevance— This quantifies the expectable benefits from the application of machine learning methods in predicting the demand for emergency medical services, which is instrumental in optimizing the service and delivering better out-of-hospital care for patients."

Moreover, high-efficiency collapse method for the multiple supply-dependency networks remains blank. Combining the centralities of degree, betweenness, closeness, and H-index, a assessment method of the comprehensive importance of node is proposed. This method considers the four centralities, and the scoring results formed by the Copeland method are used as the measurement of node importance. In addition, a novel collapse strategy for multiple supply-dependency coupled networks is proposed. Simulation experiments show that the proposed network collapse strategy has better effects on multiple supplydependency coupled networks compared to other strategies."

By analyzing the attribute changes that an attacker may trigger in real time during malicious operations, this paper identifies multi-dimensional and multilevel key attribute sets that better correspond to attack scenarios and then redefines the attribute quantification and privilege assignment rules by combining them with the Web identity. Experiments show that the proposed model is able to dynamically, efficiently and continuously assess the trust value of the subject according to the specific interactions of the subject's identity and behavior and realize a fine-grained punishment mechanism for malicious behaviors in combination with the identity marking, thus achieving a fine-grained minimization of authorization."

To achieve this, the proposed method includes an optimal active NP potential balancing mechanism that ensures minimal NP potential ripple and equal utilization of the switching devices.

    "abstract": "In recent years, 3D stacking has emerged as a promising technology for high-performance CPUs, as it offers higher yield and improved inter-die bandwidth. However, 3D CPUs are more vulnerable to thermal problems than conventional 2D CPUs due to increased power density and limited heat dissipation capabilities. In this paper, we analyze the thermal characteristics of off-the-shelf 2D and 3D CPUs, comparing them in terms of performance and on-chip temperature. In addition, to mitigate the thermal vulnerability of 3D CPUs, we introduce two thermal-aware scheduling techniques: 1) floorplan-based thermal-aware scheduling, and 2) adaptive voltage scaling (AVS)-based thermal-aware scheduling. Floorplan-based thermal-aware scheduling primarily assigns tasks to cores that are advantageous for heat dissipation based on the floorplan to mitigate thermal hotspots. AVS-based thermal-aware scheduling prioritizes the allocation of tasks to cores with lower power consumption, considering different power consumption due to process variation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that floorplan-based and AVS-based thermal-aware scheduling reduce energy consumption by 10.3% and 12.4%, respectively, compared to the legacy Linux scheduler, while maintaining performance."

In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology.

    "abstract": "The generation of high - fidelity and complex text to image data has consistently posed a significant challenge. Although pre - trained autoregressive and diffusion models have achieved remarkable realism, they are still confronted with three primary issues: (1) the requirement for massive amounts of training data and parameters to achieve optimal performance; (2) poor consistency in the alignment between generated images and text semantics; (3) the difficulty in controlling the generated visual features, which usually depend on complex prompts. To address these issues, we present MCG, an innovative framework that integrates variable masking rate image modeling with CLIP's strong text - image alignment capabilities. MCG introduces a new paradigm for text to image synthesis generation. In contrast to previous models, MCG is capable of synthesizing high - quality images. The core of this method is the utilization of quantization labels and variable masking ratios, enabling smooth adaptation to the generation task. MCG has demonstrated improvements on challenging datasets.Furthermore, current large models have been pre - trained for either generation or understanding tasks. In our work, we incorporated the CLIP understanding model into the generation model and attained impressive results. This suggests certain commonalities between understanding and generation models, which may potentially spur the development of applications for general - purpose large models. For future work, we intend to extend MCG to video generation and other multimodal tasks, capitalizing on its robust text - image alignment capabilities. We are convinced that MCG unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high - quality cross - modal generation."

The scheme is suitable for low-speed range and the amount of data stored offline is small. The unsaturated inductance with different current is fitted linearly with saturated inductance as independent variable and unsaturated inductance as dependent variable. In order to reduce the storage capacity of offline data, the regression coefficients at different currents are fitted three times, which greatly reduces the amount of stored data. Then, the residual sum of squares between the unsaturated inductance and the Fourier model is used as the cost function, and the NewtonRaphson method is used for iterative solution to obtain the position. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by experiments on 750 W SRM platform."

Multiple EDA features, including phasic components and time-varying index of sympathetic activity, were analyzed. Among the five models, the parallel 1-dimentional CNN with a stacked bi- and unidirectional LSTM demonstrated the best performance in detecting four different pain intensity levels with an M-RMSE of 0.925 and an R-squared score of 0.498. The robustness of the model was tested with 37 independent subjects from the BioVid Heat Pain Dataset, achieving an M-RMSE of 0.957 and an R-squared score of 0.495.

    "abstract": "In recent years, remote monitoring (RM) where stored pacemaker’s information is sent from home to hospitals, has become widespread. This leads to reduced burden of outpatient visits, and it is also possible to obtain useful information by analysing the large amounts of data stored with RM. However, two issues exists; the data format for RM is provided in different types of document data, which is time consuming to extract and aggregate the data manually by the clinical staff. In addition, RM reports are done once a month, resulting in only 12 reports a year, so as they are scarce, we need to unify reports for various types of patients. However, the data aggregation would require excessive workload for the healthcare professionals, therefore it is difficult to unify different types of patient data with the current RM.To solve these critical problems for the pacemaker, this study developed a pacemaker battery level estimation using a large language model (LLM) and remote monitoring historical data. With the aid of LLM, no coding is required as a relational database could be run fully automated, which should be a strong merit for non-engineers, namely, doctors and clinical staff. Based on the interactions through the LLM-based system, we can find similar patient data from the relational database easier, without the need for any technical skills. For evaluating the developed system, RM files were created for 30 people, simulating the discharge characteristics of pacemakers, and a high-order approximation curve of the characteristics was calculated from the RM history information using the OpenAI’s generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs). The optimal order approximation curve was then selected using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and a pacemaker battery remaining capacity prediction system was created. As a result, gpt-4o-latest showed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE), with a median value of 0.0124mV, which demonstrated that data analysis integrating RM and LLMs could become feasible in future pacemaker condition monitoring."

Reliable forecasting of nursing demand can optimize resource utilization and support preemptive hiring strategies; however, the use of advanced machine learning approaches to address this challenge has been limited thus far. We propose a probabilistic forecasting approach for predicting nursing workforce demand across multiple hospital units using DeepAR, an autoregressive recurrent neural network algorithm. We analyzed 5-year historical workforce data from a large US-based health system in New York, encompassing both full-time and temporary nurses across multiple specialties and hospital units. Our implementation leverages DeepAR’s ability to create a single global model for heterogeneous time-series, incorporating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, through binary feature encoding. The model was trained on 38 business unit-specialty combinations, each containing over 100 employees, with a 12-month context and prediction length. The model successfully captured complex temporal patterns, with most ground truth values falling within the 90% prediction intervals and accurately predicting both gradual trends as well as sudden magnitude changes. The model achieved consistent performance across multiple test sets through rolling window analysis, with only 9 out of 38 combinations showing significant temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, validation on 91 smaller business unit-specialty combinations (with 15-100 employees) showed no statistically significant performance degradation, indicating strong generalizability. This approach provides healthcare administrators with a reliable tool for probabilistic workforce demand forecasting, enabling more informed staffing decisions across diverse hospital settings."

Nonetheless, the rising threat of detrimental attacks on machine learning models presents significant privacy issues that may impede their extensive use. Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) approaches, such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE), have been developed to mitigate these risks and safeguard sensitive data. Notwithstanding its potential, conventional HE encounters inefficiencies, especially in applications requiring great scalability. This study introduces a unique methodology, Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE), which integrates symmetric cryptography with homomorphic encryption to rectify these inefficiencies. We present the Guard ML framework, engineered for end devices, to enable encrypted data categorization while safeguarding the privacy of both the input data and the machine learning models. Employing a case study on heart disease categorization through sensitive ECG data, our technique demonstrates the practical use of HHE. Our methodology is viable because, although there is a minor reduction in accuracy relative to unencrypted inference, both analysts and end devices have minimal communication and computational costs. Our research establishes a foundation for a future of machine learning that prioritizes safety and privacy, particularly on resource-constrained end devices, by the successful integration of HHE into PPML."

    "abstract": "Manned spacecraft as a safe system, the safety of astronauts in orbit, the normal operation of key links of the system and the smooth implementation of key tasks are the basic requirements of safety assurance. The safety design of manned spacecraft and real-time emergency response in orbit are important issues for manned spacecraft in orbit. This paper establishes the event sequence for the systemic-level hazardous events of space debris impact and sealed cabin fire, analyzes the risk transmission path, identifies the key links of safety control measures, and puts forward the design of the key links from three aspects: autonomous disposal, safety status monitoring and emergency disposal procedures. The in-orbit engineering practice of manned spacecraft shows that the research results of this paper can be used to achieve safe operation through the autonomous disposal of spacecraft platform combined with the operation of in-orbit spacecraft under the premise of minimum resource cost."

    "abstract": "This study investigates a rotor design of a consequent-pole bearingless motor with a 24-slot/8-pole combined winding configuration for high-speed applications. A bearingless motor is defined as a motor that integrates magnetic bearing functionality in a single unit, enabling the magnetic levitation of the rotor through actively regulated radial suspension forces. To generate the suspension force, two current components for torque and suspension force generation are superimposed in a single three-phase winding, called a combined winding configuration. Several rotor designs have been investigated by two-dimensional finite element calculation to have a sinusoidal magnetic flux density distribution in an air-gap to reduce suspension force ripple and core loss. For the final model, the total harmonic distortion, suspension force ripple, and core loss at 100 krpm were reduced by 30 pt, 46%, and 16%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Dysphonia, a prevalent medical condition, leads to voice loss, hoarseness, or speech interruptions. To assess it, researchers have been investigating various machine learning techniques alongside traditional medical assessments. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity for their success in audio classification and speech recognition. However, the limited availability of speech data, poses a challenge for CNNs. This study compares the performance of CNNs with standard convolutional layers, CNNs with random nonlinear convolutional layers (RANDOM models), and a novel hybrid quantum-classical architecture, Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs), which are well-suited for small datasets. The audio data was preprocessed into Mel spectrograms, comprising 243 training samples and 61 testing samples in total, and used in four experiments. A total of six models were developed: two CNNs, two RANDOM models, and two QNNs, with the second models incorporating additional layers to boost performance. The angle encoding method was employed within the quanvolutional layer, which is the quantum transformation layer of the QNNs, to enable the representation of more complex features of Mel spectrogram. The experimental results demonstrated that QNN models consistently outperformed the CNN models in both classification accuracy (ranging from 82.22% ± 4% to 89.26% ± 2%) and convergence speed across all four experiments.Clinical relevance— This work investigates the potential of quantum-based approaches for medical data classification and their promising role in enhancing dysphonia assessment."

In this paper, we investigate the performance discrepancy between evaluations based on idealized geometric channel models and those using channel state information derived from a shooting-and-bouncing ray (SBR) simulation. We propose a lightweight framework for producing realistic channel state information (CSI) that captures multipath effects such as scattering and diffraction, which are often neglected in simplified geometrical models. We focus on a 60 GHz wearable scenario, where near-body propagation effects may significantly alter link behavior. We outline the end-to-end workflow and present empirical evidence of a non-negligible performance gap between idealized and SBR-based channel assumptions. We observe the gap to be up to $2-4 \\mathrm{~dB}$ in the average array gain and 15 dB in signal variance. With our dataset and pipeline, we offer an insight into the importance of high-fidelity channel models for modern beam management methods, including compressed sensing and data-driven beam prediction."

    "abstract": "Cross-subject electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition faces significant challenges due to inter-subject variability in muscle anatomy, electrode placement, and signal characteristics. Traditional methods rely on subject-specific calibration data to adapt models to new users, an approach that is both time-consuming and impractical for large-scale, real-world deployment. This paper presents an approach to eliminate calibration requirements through feature disentanglement, enabling effective cross-subject generalization. We propose an end-to-end dual-branch adversarial neural network that simultaneously performs pattern recognition and individual identification by disentangling EMG features into pattern-specific and subject-specific components. The pattern-specific components facilitate robust pattern recognition for new users without model calibration, while the subject-specific components enable downstream applications such as task-invariant biometric identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves robust performance on data from unseen users, outperforming various baseline methods in cross-subject scenarios. Overall, this study offers a new perspective for cross-subject EMG pattern recognition without model calibration and highlights the proposed model’s potential for broader applications, such as task-independent biometric systems."

Some investigators have suggested that larger resections lead to greater chance of seizure freedom, while others report no relationship. In this study, we examine the relationship between resection size and seizure freedom through (i) total volume analysis and (ii) a mass univariate regional approach.Patient demographics and resection volumes were collected for 283 patients who underwent subsequent ATLR, and seizure freedom was measured after 12 months. Additionally, the percentage resection of each Desikan-Kiliany parcellated region was calculated. We computed the AUC to measure effect sizes and used Wilcoxon ranksum tests to assess significance.Total resection volumes were larger in males than females, and larger in right than left ATLR. However, when scaled to percentage of brain tissue resected, only the hemisphere difference remained. There was no significant association of total or regional resection volume with post-operative seizure freedom.Larger resections in males are due to their larger total brain volumes. Smaller left-sided resections reflect the more conservative surgical approach in the language dominant hemisphere. Within the normal ranges of a typical ATLR, larger resection volumes do not increase chance of seizure-freedom. Future studies should investigate the details of the resection of gray matter, such as piriform cortex, and white matter tracts that can form epileptogenic networks."

Simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC evaluate two key scenarios: PSH for system performance improvement and PSH for consistent power supply. In the first scenario, PSH significantly improves voltage stability during faults, showing a 0.2 p.u. voltage increase and recovery within three seconds. Tripping events reveal that PSH enables faster system recovery, supported by timely load shedding. The second scenario highlights the impact of PSH on frequency and voltage stability. Despite non-critical load shedding, frequency falls outside Indonesia's allowable range (49–51 Hz), indicating PSH's dominant role in active power support over diesel generation. The results underscore PSH's potential to improve microgrid performance. Future integration of battery energy storage systems (BESS) is proposed to further enhance frequency response and system resilience during transients."

This decline prompted a study on the language learning strategies and their relationship to the students' English Proficiency Test (EPT) performance. The study focused on Grade 11 students selected via stratified random sampling, which was utilized as a quantitative research design, using questionnaires and the EPT as main instruments. EPT results revealed satisfactory performance in vocabulary and verbal ability but indicated areas for improvement in correct usage and error identification. In terms of language learning strategies (LLS), the data revealed that the respondents often employed cognitive strategies, with 62.5 percent of the respondents, followed by 59.4 percent often employed metacognitive strategies, and 57.8 percent often employed social affective strategies. The frequency application of the different strategies shows that there is an equal number of respondents who always employ metacognitive and social affective strategies, while there is a lesser number of respondents who always employ cognitive strategies. A significant difference was found in the EPT performance of the respondents when they were grouped according to demographic profile with older students, females, STEM learners, and those from private schools performing better in most areas than those from public schools specifically in vocabulary (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$p$</tex>-value <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=.010$</tex>).

The numerator and denominator polynomials of the model's transfer function are decomposed into components containing the zeros in the left and right half of the complex plane. Based on the object models order and the conditions for solving the algebraic equation system, physical realizability of the control algorithm, and system robustness, the desired polynomial of the synthesized system is constructed. This polynomial is composed of two polynomials with unknown coefficients, and the degrees and unknown polynomials, as well as the degree of the desired polynomial, are calculated. The dominant poles of the synthesized system are determined from the imposed damping ratio and settling time, and based on them, the closed-loop system's characteristic polynomial is constructed. If necessary, additional real poles are added, placed as far as possible from the dominant poles to meet system performance requirements. From the equality of polynomials, by matching the coefficients of like powers of the variable s from both sides of the equation, an algebraic equation system is obtained, from which the unknown coefficients and polynomials are determined. Based on the stable components of the object model and the unknown polynomials, the transfer function of the control algorithm is constructed. Examples of controller tuning for one zero and one to fourth poles models using the polynomial method are analyzed. The synthesized systems exhibit high performance and good robustness."

To address data scarcity, we employ transfer learning with pretrained speech foundation models, originally developed for automatic speech recognition but capable of capturing rich acoustic representations beyond linguistic content. By analysing temporal attention weights in the extracted HuBERT embeddings, we demonstrate that these models effectively capture respiratory patterns. Our findings suggest that repurposing speech foundation models for sleep staging provides a scalable, non-contact alternative to PSG, with promising applications in home-based and clinical settings.Clinical Relevance—This demonstrates the feasibility of a non-contact, sound-based approach to sleep staging, potentially improving access and adherence in clinical and home settings."

Yet, owing to the striking resemblance in the cellular morphological traits of HABs, prevailing image categorization networks confront considerable hurdles when it comes to the accurate differentiation of such algal blooms. To tackle this predicament, the present research introduces a deep learning framework (FDIR) tailored for marine hazard identification, which hinges on multi-scale feature merging and inverted residual encoders, with the goal of boosting the precision of HABs classification. This framework is structured with a dual-branch design: the first branch is anchored by the inverted residual encoder module, primarily tasked with extracting and depicting the global semantic characteristics of images; the second branch, through the seamless integration of convolutional neural networks and a dual-channel attention mechanism, realizes the accurate acquisition and amplification of critical feature data related to HABs. Contrastive trials were carried out utilizing the public HAB dataset provided by AICO Labs. The outcomes indicate that, in comparison with prevalent classification network frameworks, the FDIR framework reaches a top-tier classification accuracy of 90.22%, and also demonstrates superior competitive capabilities in aspects such as model training duration and convergence efficacy."

A structural-acoustic coupling analysis is carried out on a typical composite plate-acoustic cavity coupling system, and the accuracy and effectiveness of the method were verified by Monte Carlo numerical simulation.

Although our previous method suppressed the noise spectrum by estimating the noise in the direct current (DC) spatial frequency bin by subtracting it from non-DC spectral components, the proposed method treats the DC bin of the observed amplitude spectral image as a missing area and estimates the noise spectrum by restoring it through image inpainting and then subtracting it. By retraining for Stable Diffusion, the model acquires restoration capabilities tailored to acoustic signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated under conditions in which the speech of competing speakers was treated as noise. The proposed method demonstrated high noise suppression performance for both known and unknown speakers, indicating the effectiveness of applying the high versatility and adaptability of the diffusion model to acoustical signal processing."

    "abstract": "Inertial motion tracking (IMT) refers to technology that uses wearable inertial sensors to track the motion of robots or humans, and it has become fundamental to various applications. To achieve a detailed, location-independent analysis of movement patterns, IMT of kinematic chains (KC) is performed. Current IMT-KC methods require expert knowledge of the joints’ degrees of freedom (DoF) and their corresponding axes, limiting the applicability of IMT-KC to professional settings. This paper introduces a plug-and-play, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based model for IMT-KC. It is designed to estimate the relative orientation between adjacent inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on segments that are connected by rotational joints with arbitrary DoF, without requiring prior knowledge of the joint axes or DoF. The model was trained solely on simulated data, and zero-shot estimates the relative orientation of the IMUs placed on 3D-printed real-world KCs with a mean error of less than 9° for all joint types (1 DoF, 2 DoF, and 3 DoF). Although the proposed method may not always match the absolute accuracy of specialized techniques, it stands out for its flexibility, robustness, and ease of deployment. Furthermore, we show that, once it converges, the model stays highly stable and is inherently resilient to variations in IMU placement. By significantly reducing the need for detailed prior knowledge of joint configurations and offering broad adaptability across different joint types, the proposed model simplifies the deployment of inertial motion tracking systems, making them more accessible to non-experts. This represents a significant step toward applying IMT-KC in biomedical fields such as rehabilitation and everyday motion analysis outside of clinical or laboratory environments, where ease of use is crucial."

    "abstract": "Nanocrystalline toroidal cores have high saturation capability, enabling smaller sizes and reduced volumes in electronic components. However, its original high permeability poses a challenge of saturation under small excitation magnitude when applied as a power inductor. This paper investigates and compares three permeability reduction methods-stress annealing (SA), physical crushing (PC), and magnetic annealing (MA)-and identifies their feasibility for power inductor applications. Loss performance under various excitation frequencies and magnitudes is presented. The results indicate that when the excitation frequency is within tens of kHz, the SA-core has the lowest core loss, exhibiting six times lower than ferrite (N87). Additionally, the permeability of the SA-core can be modulated by applying different stress intensities, and the core loss will first reduce slightly and then increase as the permeability varies from 500 to 3000."

Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have significant applicability in various medical and non-medical industries, including stroke rehabilitation, wheelchair control, and drone operation. However, the practical application of EEG remains limited by the decoding performance and generalization ability of MI signalsThis study introduces a multi-branch self-attention network for motor imagery (MI) signal classification. Each branch independently processes EEG signals decomposed into distinct frequency bands through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanisms, enabling the extraction of both fundamental and discriminative spatial-temporal features. To further capture dynamic temporal dependencies, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are integrated. We systematically evaluate three signal decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), and brain rhythm-based decomposition—to optimize feature representation. Extensive experiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with subject-dependent and subject-independent accuracies of 84.04% and 71.67%, respectively. Comparative analyses against benchmark models (EEGNet, EEGTCNet, ShallowConvNet, etc.) validate the superiority of our approach in classification accuracy and generalization capabilityClinical relevance— This study investigates the methods for decoding motor imagery EEG signals and establishes the positive role of each module in classification.

    "abstract": "Early infancy is a crucial period for brain development, during which fundamental functional and structural frameworks are established. Understanding the maturation of large-scale brain networks during this stage is essential for characterizing normative neurodevelopment and identifying potential deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated developmental changes in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in infants using a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset comprising 137 scans from 74 low-likelihood developing infants aged 0–6 months. We applied independent component analysis to extract large-scale brain networks and utilized advanced spatial metrics, including network-averaged spatial similarity (NASS) to assess alignment with group-level patterns, network strength to quantify neural engagement based on voxel intensities, and network size to examine spatial distribution. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in NASS across multiple networks, indicating greater consistency in functional organization over time. Additionally, most networks demonstrated increased network strength, reflecting heightened neural involvement, while network size exhibited distinct developmental trajectories, with some networks expanding and others remaining stable. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of functional brain architecture during early infancy, providing critical insights into neurodevelopmental processes.Clinical Relevance— This study provides critical insights into early brain network development, which is essential for identifying biomarkers of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. By mapping typical maturation patterns using advanced spatial metrics, our findings offer a foundation for early detection of atypical development.

Ranging from image classification to text generation, Transformer-based models have demonstrated unprecedented performance. However, they suffer from a significant computational complexity and a large memory footprint, leading to memory-bound issues. While previous research on NAND flash-based neural network computation has been performed, these studies often encounter accuracy problems, as analog processing-in memory (PIM) operations typically lead to inaccurate results. Moreover, studies on NAND flash using single-level cell (SLC) are unable to fully leverage the advantages of efficient storage density on the multi-level cell (MLC) memory. We propose an E-Flash hardware architecture with an energy-efficient DNN mapping method. E-Flash introduces a state-switching algorithm to perform data movements between flash memory and host device in an energy-efficient manner. By reallocating the data in triple-level cell (TLC) NAND flash memory, we reduce the energy consumption during the data read operation. Experimental results demonstrate that E-Flash achieves improved energy consumption compared to baseline under significantly small area overhead for quantized BERT and Llama 2 weights by 37.73% and 16.74%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Mental disorders, such as anxiety and depression, affect approximately 900 million people worldwide, posing severe challenges to healthcare systems and society. Accurate classification of mental disorders is crucial for effective treatment. However, current diagnostic methods primarily rely on behavioral observation and self-reported questionnaires, which are highly influenced by patient subjectivity and physician expertise. Sleep provides a stable physiological state largely unaffected by subjective emotions. Sleep-related vital signs, such as respiration and heart rate, offer valuable insights into mental health conditions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel method for mental disorder classification by monitoring physiological signals during sleep. We utilize a millimeter-wave radar to monitor respiratory and body movement patterns, along with a pulse oximeter to acquire photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Statistical features extracted based on medical prior knowledge are then input into a deep neural network together with raw physiological signals for mental disorder classification. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of 447 participants validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. This study provides a portable and objective solution for mental disorder classification, contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and facilitating broader access to mental healthcare resources.Clinical Relevance— This study provides an objective and portable method for classifying mental disorders, which is of significant importance for improving diagnostic accuracy and promoting the decentralization of healthcare resources."

    "abstract": "Ripple-based V2 adaptive on-time (AOT) control has been widely used in single and multi-phase buck converters for voltage regulators (VR) due to its compact structure, high system bandwidth, and good light-load efficiency. The fast dynamic transient response performance can address high load current and high slew rate changes with a low output voltage fluctuation. However, the stability issues of V2-AOT control with and without phase overlapping pose critical challenges for varying duty ratios and component tolerance. In this paper, a hybrid V2-AOT control architecture with both triangular and sawtooth ramp injections is proposed. The sawtooth ramp slope varies smoothly in accordance with duty ratio to enhance system phase margin at low duty ratios and ensure system stability at high duty ratios. Theoretical analysis and practical design implementations are presented to mitigate subharmonic instability within a wide duty ratio range. The proposed control architecture is verified using experimental results from a fabricated two-phase buck converter chip. Compared to conventional fixed sawtooth ramp schemes, a balancing design between the stability with phase overlapping and high phase margin at low duty ratios can be achieved by the proposed duty-related hybrid structure."

In traditional three-stage SST architectures, a large number of components is typically required, which impacts the system cost and complexity. Multiwinding-based SSTs can reduce the number of semiconductors and transformers. However, such solutions often compromise system modularity and increase the complexity and cost of implementing redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel CHB-based SST topology that retains the benefits of multiwinding SSTs while preserving high modularity. The system design and the control strategy are described in detail and validated through a 1.5 MVA system simulation. The design shows that this architecture requires 336 semiconductors and 12 transformers, while the conventional architecture would require 432 semiconductors and 36 transformers. Fault-tolerance capabilities are also demonstrated via a unit fault scenario, highlighting the enhanced availability enabled by the high modularity obtained in this architecture. Experimental results from a single unit further validate the proposed architecture."

Not only does it facilitate remote work and telecommunication which are critical remote services such as telemedicine and distance education, they are also essential in supporting sustainable practices like the application of IoT in monitoring environmental conditions and energy usage. To ensure that these networks work optimally, it is essential that the datasets used in their development are not only accurate but are also distinct. This study contributes to this end by analyzing the datasets generated by the COST 2100, a model that is used extensively in wireless communications. Using ANOVA, the researchers determined if the dataset are indeed distinct as signals bounce about multiple clustering which use Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) Technology similar to modern wireless systems like 5G. Results show that the different variables or dimensions are distinct from each other. Thus, the datasets generated by COST2100 are suitable to be utilized in further preprocessing methods of wireless multipath clustering, ultimately contributing to building a more sustainable wireless communication system."

However, both signals also exhibit aperiodic characteristics, such as self-similarity and 1/f-like behavior. Recently, a novel model has been proposed to account for both the periodic and aperiodic components of biosignals. In this preliminary study, we investigate the functional coupling between the aperiodic components of EEG and heart period (HP) time series, hypothesizing a link between specific generators of functional aperiodic activity. Experimental results were obtained from the analysis of multimodal data collected from 20 healthy volunteers in a resting supine position. Our findings suggest the presence of significant functional coupling between the exponents of the 1/f components derived separately from EEG and HP time series. We conclude that a functional relationship exists between brain- and heartbeat- related aperiodic components in specific brain regions. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological mechanisms and implications of this newly defined BHI dimension."

    "abstract": "Split Federated Learning (SFL) is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning framework suitable for resource-constrained clients. It splits the neural network model between client and server such that most of the computations are offloaded to the server, without sharing private client raw data to server. One drawback of the system is the large communication cost caused by frequent activations/gradients exchanges between client and server. Previous SFL works have focused on reducing the communication cost of homogeneous clients without considering communication heterogeneity due to variations in channel conditions. In this paper, we focus on a more realistic scenario, where clients have to communicate under different channel conditions and also handle non-iid data. We address the heterogeneity in the channel conditions of different clients by applying different degrees of compression on the data to be communicated and also adding an auxiliary network at the client-end to facilitate local training during times when the clients cannot communicate to the server. The experimental results on VGG11 and ResNet18 show that our method significantly reduces the training time and energy consumption with very little accuracy drop, compared with other competing methods."

Ultrasound and tactile imaging experts analyzed 16 images—both cadaveric and phantom—identifying them as real or synthetic, rating confidence levels, and noting distinguishing features. A confusion matrix was used to calculate the true positive rate (TPR), which reflected the correct identification of cadaveric images, and the false positive rate (FPR), which indicated instances where a phantom was misclassified as real. The mean TPR values were 0.46 for ultrasound and 0.4 for tactile imaging, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing between the two. Experts identified key features, such as noise, smoothness, and structural irregularities, but often struggled to confidently differentiate real from synthetic tissue.Clinical Relevance— This study introduces visual observation as a valuable evaluation method, expanding training phantom development beyond material property measurements.

It is crucial to restore natural and smooth daily movements, and continuous force control is one of the most important kinaesthetic functions. However, the complex continuous force decoding and limited relevant public datasets greatly challenge this field. How the brain coordinates the motor command or sensory feedback during the force control behaviour also remains to be discussed. This work investigated these questions through a novel experimental setup by isolating the motor intention and sensory feedback and combining both components flexibly for hand grip. We applied functional electrical stimulation to induce passive gripping and collected grip force with multi-modal brain signals. Significant neural pattern differences were found in EEG time-frequency representation by comparing the brain responses under different task conditions, including voluntary movement, motor imagery, and passive perception status. Additionally, we present a multi-modal graph fusion model fusing both EEG and fNIRS for continuous bimanual grip force decoding. These contributions are beneficial to developing neural interfaces for rehabilitation and assistive devices that involve force manipulation or operate in isometric schemes."

    "abstract": "The Vector group phase displacement (also referred to as phase shift) is one of the main parameters of the three-phase transformer. Its property plays a fundamental role in the field of electrotechnical engineering. For its determination, the traditional theoretical methods utilize the phasor diagrams of the transformer windings-a geometric analysis-based approach. This research article presents an algebraic calculation method-a novel theoretical approach-that utilizes a generalized algebraic equation expressed as a function of the ‘angular connection variables of the three-phase windings’-a concept also herein introduced and applied to star, delta, and zigzag configurations."

    "abstract": "The old saying goes: “Two heads are better than one”. Properly synthesizing multiple controllers may achieve better performance than using a single controller. This paper proposed a controller synthesis strategy with the principal component regression (PCR) method. First, the training data is derived from controllers designed in different ways. The input features are then formed from the historical data. Then the high-dimensional features are projected to a low-dimensional orthogonal subspace, eliminating correlations between features. The regression in the orthogonal subspace improves efficiency, robustness, and generalization. This paper utilizes PCR to synthesize model predictive control (MPC) and proportional-integral (PI) controllers. Experiment results show that the synthesized controller outperforms the MPC and PI controllers in steady-state and transient conditions, respectively. Besides, the low computation complexity of the PCR, i.e., O(1), makes it implementable in a digital signal processor (DSP)."

    "abstract": "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a powerful tool for studying brain function but presents challenges due to high dimensionality and variability. We propose a self-supervised transformer-based foundation model using a masked autoencoder to learn generalizable representations of fMRI time series. Trained on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 dataset, the model is evaluated on cognitive task classification and neuroticism prediction using linear, MLP, and ConvLSTM probes under zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Our model outperforms training from scratch, exceeding 90% accuracy in cognitive task classification and improving correlations in neuroticism prediction. Architectural enhancements, including contrastive loss and spatiotemporal attention, further refine representations. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised transformers for fMRI analysis, enabling scalable, generalizable models for neuroscience and clinical applications."

    "abstract": "Analyzing cell - cell adhesion at the single - cell level is of paramount importance for deciphering the fundamental mechanisms underlying various diseases, particularly those characterized by cell - cell interactions, such as atherosclerosis. This level of analysis enables the early identification of disease - specific cellular behaviors, which is pivotal for the development of more targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, existing single - cell analysis tools are plagued by limitations. For instance, they often have restricted force ranges and lack the precision required to accurately differentiate between different cell subtypes. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel acoustic evaluation platform that leverages hypersonic streaming jet technology. This innovative platform integrates a microscale acoustic probe with an advanced robotic arm. This combination allows for highly precise and non - invasive measurement of the adhesion forces between monocytes and endothelial cells at the single - cell level. The force range of this platform can be precisely tuned from a few piconewtons to hundreds of nanonewtons, and it achieves single - cell - scale spatial precision. Employing this platform, we conducted an in - depth investigation into the impact of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. Our experimental findings demonstrate that as the concentration of LPS increases, the adhesion strength of U937 monocytes to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) rises significantly. These results not only provide valuable insights into the role of LPS in modulating monocyte - endothelial cell adhesion but also highlight the potential of our platform in accurately assessing this crucial biological process.Clinical Relevance— The innovative application of acoustic methods to detect monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells offers novel insights into the initial stages of plaque formation and underscores the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis. This advancement significantly propels the field of cardiovascular medicine forward."

    "abstract": "Software defect prediction is an essential method in software engineering because it makes it feasible to identify flaws and weaknesses in software systems early on. This work proposed three machine learning (ML) approaches (Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost). This paper proposed a good technique for software failure prediction. First, the JM1 dataset from the PROMISE repository is preprocessed and balanced. After that, those features are recovered, and the data is separated into 30-70% for testing and training. The primary technique contains the RF, GB, and XGBoost models, which have been meticulously tuned for maximum performance. These models are then put on a rigorous performance test that includes characteristics like recall, precision, accuracy, and the F1 score. With an accuracy of 83.06%, the XGBoost model outperformed the other two models, demonstrating its robustness and usefulness in software defect detection tasks. Furthermore, the model's prediction accuracy is improved by employing the Gain Ratio (GR) for feature selection and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for data balance. This work enhances the domain of software defect detection via three ML models and throws light on their characteristics and applications."

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of neurons in the brain is used routinely in neuroscience and has numerous clinical applications. In contrast to invasive neural stimulation using invasive probes inserted in the brain, transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) is a safe and non-surgical neuromodulation modality. TES is generally performed using individually positioned large electrodes, which limits its precision and control. In this paper, we utilize high density surface electrode arrays to precisely control the location of TES in the human motor cortex. Current pulses of 100 µs duration and 50 to 150 mA amplitude were injected across electrodes chosen from within an array of 64 electrodes (7 mm pitch) placed above the motor cortex while recording high resolution electromyogrpahic (EMG) activity in the contralateral arm and hand muscles. Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude quantifies the changes in activity across the different muscles as a function of the stimulation electrode position. A map of motor responses to TES for six muscle groups in the arm is presented, showing that moving the injected electric field by sub-cm distances changes the activation profile of arm and hand muscles. This work demonstrates the potential of TES to elicit precisely controlled motor activity.Clinical relevance—Precision TES could replace invasive stimulation in some clinical applications, as well as improve the precision of intraoperative monitoring of muscle function"

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel multilevel inverter topology, the pack U-clamped cell (PUCC), which enables to provide single DC source multilevel inverter by different graph structure compared to the cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverters. This structure by providing a clamped connection can bring opportunities that do not exist in CHB-MLIs. By replacing a couple inductor or transformer in clamped connection this topology can integrate multilevel inverter energy storage to exploit the exceed power of renewable energy sources to charge batteries. The transformer does not make any disturbances in multilevel inverter function. In this study a flexible vector-based modulation technique called one-dimensional space vector modulation OD-SVM has been considered to charge battery storage through zero-voltage crossing of multilevel inverter. Simulation and experimental results show the performance of the PUCC and it OD-SVM modulation technique."
