    "abstract": "This study presents a novel IoT-enabled fitness tracking device intended to improve patient care through the capture of real-time physiological records and predictive analytics. The system uses a variety of sensors, including an Arduino UNO, an LM35, a MAX30100 pulse charge and SPo2 sensor, and a stress sensor, to continuously gather health data from ten different patients. Proactive health assessments and early intervention are made possible by the combination of cloud-based analysis and advanced system learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Tested on real-world datasets, the experimental results show how effective the device is at making accurate and timely predictions. Notably, SVM is the most accurate variant, closely followed by ANN, KNN, and RNN. The confusion matrices ensure accurate and thorough examination of each version’s performance, aiding in selecting the most relevant set of rules for real-time health monitoring to be used by clinicians. The present study, as groundbreaking work, demonstrates a major leap in merging IoT with device expertise in the healthcare sector that usages new possibilities in proactive and personalized treatment strategies.

    "abstract": "GPS spoofing poses a critical threat to maritime autonomous surface ships, compromising navigation integrity and situational awareness. Existing research is limited by the lack of realistic datasets and reproducible evaluation environments. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for GPS spoofing detection, combining a modular simulation of spoofing attacks(ghost vessel, gradual drift, location jumps, replay and meaconing), machine learning-based detection, and an automated response module. Our simulator generates over 950 labeled spoofed AIS points merged with normal data to create a ground-truth dataset suitable for model training and evaluation. Among the evaluated models, a GRU-based approach achieved the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.98, high recall, and only six false negatives. The integrated response module applies debouncing logic to classify suspicious events and triggers email alerts for confirmed spoofing, enabling real-time operational monitoring. These results demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable and effective reproducible solution for enhancing maritime navigation security."

    "abstract": "The integration of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with Internet of Things (IoT) devices has driven the need for efficient, low-complexity multiple access techniques. However, most approaches based on the Slotted Aloha protocol rely on the ON-OFF channel model, which oversimplifies the physical channel phenomena and neglects critical fading effects. To overcome this limitation, the present work develops a precise closed-form analytical model for instantaneous throughput, outage, and data collision probabilities of a direct-to-satellite IoT (DtS-IoT) network operating over Nakagami-m fading channels while employing the Slotted Aloha technique. The analysis accounts for the presence of multiple satellites in orbit, each with different channel loads and elevation angles, thus providing a more realistic representation of fading conditions and inter-satellite variability. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed analytical expressions and show that they exhibit excellent agreement with theoretical predictions under Nakagami-m fading. Furthermore, the results indicate that dynamically adjusting the transmit power and channel load, especially when satellite position information is available, can significantly increase system throughput and provide actionable insights for system optimization in terms of energy efficiency and overall performance."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a dual-mode isolated dc-dc (DMIDC) converter for wide input voltage range applications. Under the fixed-frequency circulant duty cycle modulation, the two operation modes of the converter and the output voltage regulation can be achieved by only controlling the total duty cycle of all lower switches of the half bridge modules (HBMs) in each bridge arm as a single control variable. Also, self-balancing of HBM capacitor voltages and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of all switches can be realized. The interleaved parallel structure based on series-connected HBMs reduces input current ripple and lowers the voltage stress of switches. Compared with the LLC resonant converters with variable structure and variable frequency control, the proposed scheme only needs to control the total duty cycle without the need for other control variables and additional input voltage sampling circuit to achieve mode transition within a wide input voltage. Moreover, compared with other wide voltage range resonant converters, the proposed DMIDC converter not only has better load characteristics but also has lower voltage stress on primary devices. Finally, the performance of the proposed DMIDC is validated through experiments on a 400 W prototype with 75–300 V input and 330 V output."

    "abstract": "The interest in the healthcare industry is increasing due to changes in the healthcare system, an aging population and the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, the advances in deep learning technology have shown excellent performance in various fields, and this includes rapid application and dissemination in healthcare services. However, deep learning models, which consist of neural networks with multiple hidden layers, have a black-box problem due to their complexity and numerous computation processes. This paper proposes a deep learning model that applies optimized explainable artificial intelligence based on multi-stream for identifying arrhythmia signals. First, the Variational Mode Decomposition was applied to detect the characteristics of arrhythmia signals which have non-linear features. Next, the decomposed signal was used to identify arrhythmia signals using a multi-stream convolutional neural network consisting of four single networks. Lastly, to analyze the optimized arrhythmia signal identification results from each single network, the importance results were visualized by fusing the Grad-CAM algorithm, an explainable artificial intelligence. As a result of the experiment, the identification results of arrhythmia signals using the multi-stream based four single networks proposed in this paper showed accuracies of 94.6%, 94.7%, 95.9%, and 96%, respectively, with differences in accuracy ranging from 0.1% to 1.4% depending on the intrinsic mode function. Additionally, the optimized identification and analysis results of arrhythmia signals were obtained by using explainable artificial intelligence based on a multi-stream approach, even in cases where there were differences in identification results between the single networks."

    "abstract": "The cross-regional interconnections of the power system complicates the network topology behind it, which undoubtedly brings great computational challenges to the related simulation analysis. To address this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for power grid topology renormalization based on the Louvain community detection algorithm. This framework aims to coarse-graining the original power grid into a smaller-scale network, thereby significantly simplifying its topology while preserving key properties. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted extensive simulation experiments on a class of synthetic power grids and six real-world power grid datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can nearly perfectly retain the critical structural characteristics and power flow properties of the original power grid during the renormalization process. From a practical application perspective, our findings provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the structural evolution and dynamical behavior of large-scale power grids."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) has become an effective strategy for enhancing multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) by breaking down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps. Despite its interpretability benefits, MCoT often encounters difficulties with fine-grained semantic grounding, particularly when reasoning involves small objects, subtle attributes, or visually complex scenes that can lead to inaccuracies. Existing attempts to address these issues primarily fall into two categories: fine-tuning, which depends on large annotated datasets and costly parameter updates; and in-context learning (ICL), which achieves few-shot or zero-shot reasoning without model modification. Although ICL provides flexibility and adaptability, it is prone to semantic drift caused by an unstable prompt quality. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an entity-level evidence generation and verification framework using the ICL paradigm. This approach first produces MCoT from multimodal inputs, followed by extraction of key entities with enriched evidential descriptions. These entities were then cross-validated through adversarial checks using multiple MLLMs, and the verified evidence was integrated back into the reasoning chain. Experiments demonstrated consistent performance gains: on ScienceQA, the accuracy improved from 82.39% to 86.04%(+3.65%) with GPT-3.5, 84.96% to 89.37%(+4.41%) with Gemini; on MathVista, the accuracy increased from 43.1% to 43.6%(+0.50%) with GPT-3.5, and from 44.7% to 45.6%(+0.90%) with Gemini. These results establish newstate-of-the-art baselines and confirm the robustness and generalizability of the entity-level verification for multimodal reasoning."

    "abstract": "With large-scale renewables integration in different voltage levels, operational flexibility in hierarchical power grids has become increasingly important. Embedded high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, with their flexible control modes, offer significant potential for enhancing flexibility support across different regional power grids. However, in existing scheduling studies, embedded HVDC is often simplistically treated as an adjustable power node, neglecting its multiple control modes and dynamic switching behavior, which may lead to overly optimistic results. This paper proposes a hierarchical scheduling approach for grid flexibility improvement considering embedded HVDC control modes. First, a detail mathematical model of embedded HVDC considering its control modes is established and integrated into the scheduling problem. Next, a hierarchical scheduling method is proposed to enhance grid flexibility considering inter regional power changes, equivalent ramping capability and the control characteristics of embedded VSC-HVDC. Finally, an adaptive convergence robust optimization (RO) algorithm is introduced to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling approach more accurately and practically considers the control characteristics of embedded HVDC, enhancing grid flexibility while preventing potential risks of voltage over-limit in regional grids."

    "abstract": "In sports analytics, tactical visualization is widely used to convey valuable insights. However, due to the complex domain knowledge and contextual information involved in tactical visualizations, it is challenging for users to connect high-level tactical insights to corresponding visual patterns. This requires users to engage in a reasoning process to interpret insights within game contexts, which remains insufficiently supported in existing visual-text linking studies. In this work, we propose InsightChaser, a novel approach to bridge tactical insights and soccer visualizations through visual-text linking and visual reasoning enhancement. InsightChaser constructs knowledge graphs to represent both visual elements and contextual game information. Integrating large language models (LLMs), our approach retrieves relevant visual elements and establishes explicit links with insights. Moreover, InsightChaser utilizes LLMs to enhance these visual-text links by providing reasoning explanations and visual effects. We further develop an interactive visualization system that supports navigation and explanation of enhanced visual-text links. Users can explore linked tactical insights interactively and reason through enhanced visual explanations. We conduct two case studies using real-world soccer data and a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach"

    "abstract": "When a seller sells its product through both direct and platform channels, it is faced with the decision of selecting a supporting service for each channel—either the platform service or third-party service. This study investigates whether the platform owner allows the seller on it to use third-party service and further explores which service portfolio should be adopted by the seller. Our results show that the platform never allows the seller to use third-party service if the platform service has a quality advantage or only a slight quality disadvantage. Interestingly, such platform behavior does not necessarily lead to lower consumer surplus or diminished social welfare. In addition, the seller's choice of service portfolio depends on the quality difference between platform and third-party services. When the platform service has a significant quality disadvantage, the seller may adopt either the PT (platform service on the platform and third-party service in the direct channel) or the TT (third-party service in both channels) portfolio. Conversely, if the disadvantage is relatively low or if the platform service has a quality advantage, the seller chooses either the PT or the PP (platform service in both channels) portfolio. Moreover, the seller may opt for a service portfolio that maximizes its profit at the expense of total consumer demand. Notably, service differentiation in the channels (PT or TP) consistently results in higher commission price charged by the platform and greater total consumer demand."

SPSS-based univariate and multiple regression analyses showed a low average GOHAI score (38.03 ± 10.21), indicating poor oral health. Univariate analysis suggested that education, chronic conditions, and oral hygiene practices significantly correlated with GOHAI (P &lt; 0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that occupation and denture use independently influenced oral health (P &lt; 0.05). These findings highlight that the targeted behavioral interventions, particularly for less-educated individuals or denture wearers—could notably enhance elderly oral health."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "A transmission-level vacuum circuit breaker (TVCB) is a high-tech power device that major companies have been competing to develop in recent years. The technical bottleneck for the development comes mainly from the more severe electric field stress (E-stress) in the working scene and the dynamic insulation deterioration. The saturation effect of the breakdown voltage on the vacuum gap separation forces the electrode structure design to be magnified geometrically, causing new technical problems in the multi-physical field. In terms of enhancing the dynamic insulation level of TVCB, it is necessary to focus on the weak-point of breakdown (WP) to form a mechanism for strengthening the dielectric recovery. Combined measures to restrain WPs includes: re-examining the selection of contact materials and the structural design of the interrupter for intercepting WP, defining WP states parameters, forming a closed-loop control of deep conditioning, and finally, expanding dynamicconditioning procedures and in-service maintenance requirements.The tolerance of E-stress is the underlying logic from the perspective of the field source. Along the path of E-stress sharing, the traditional TVCB electrode system can be converted to a back-to-back series structure of a vacuum interrupter pair (VIP), with each separation of the pair set in the linear growth region of the breakdown/separation curve. So the axial E-stress sharing of the main gap can be completed under the unchanged spatial scale. Several floating potential shields are set up, together with the main shield, formed an auxiliary gap channel parallel to the main gap. It can further share the E-stress radically. In addition, the finely designed floating shields can also balance the distribution of TRV inside the VIP.Taking the VIP electric field design of 252kV-TVCB as an empirical research case, the modeling and simulation of the VIP equivalent electrical network were completed. By the analysis of the VIP dual-ended drive and the discussion of the multi-break synchronization control, the module framework design and VIP prototype for 252kV-TVCB have been completed. The high-voltage test device for the factory inspection of the vacuum interrupter is used to test the voltage parameters of the VIP prototype.The empirical research results show that, the E-stress sharing is a practical strategy to increase the working voltage of TVCB. The comprehensive management of WP can make up for the technical shortcoming of TVCB relative to SF6 in dynamic insulation. The vacuum interrupter pair form can increase the working voltage and dynamic insulation level. Unlike the conventional double-break VCB, the pair structure shares a break-node, which reduces the influence of the distribution parameters, so as to obtain higher series efficiency. Furthermore, the discrete welding of VIP can also significantly reduce the manufacturing difficulty and production cost of TVCB."

    "abstract": "Surface discharge mechanisms in vacuum and suppression methods should be understood to enhance vacuum circuit breaker performance. In the present study, using a cylindrical vacuum sample with modified electrode shapes and barrier installation, the effects of changes in electric field distribution on an insulator surface on discharge characteristics were analyzed. Measurements under an impulse voltage showed that the onset of flashover (FO) progression was delayed, while FO development time was shortened in the reshaped samples. This indicates that the increase in the perpendicular electric field component suppressed the secondary electron emission avalanche (SEEA) and reduced the arrival of electrons to the anode. The barrier effectively hindered the progression of secondary electrons on the insulator. Furthermore, we calculated the secondary electron emission coefficient (SEEC) and confirmed that increasing the vertical component of the electric field on the insulator surface effectively reduced the SEEC value. These findings provide insights for optimizing electrode design and barrier placement to mitigate vacuum surface discharges and improve circuit breaker reliability."

The characteristics of the vacuum arc are crucial in determining the performance of the vacuum circuit breaker. The inter-electrode plasma in the vacuum arc is generated by multiple cathode spots on the cathode surface. The plasma jet produced by each cathode spot merges at a certain distance from the cathode, forming a plasma column. Therefore, investigating the mixing process of high-current vacuum arc jets generated by multiple cathode spots is essential for advancing the understanding of vacuum arcs. In this study, based on a steady-state threedimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, the vector magnetic potential equation was used to replace the magnetic transport equation, enhancing the accuracy of the magnetic field calculation. The mixing processes of vacuum arc jets produced by a single cathode spot and multiple cathode spots were simulated and analyzed. The simulation results provide insights into ion density, ion pressure, ion temperature, axial ion velocity, and axial current density, and the influence of a uniform axial magnetic field on the mixing characteristics of cathode spot vacuum arc jets was studied. This work provides a theoretical foundation for further research on vacuum arcs and for enhancing the interruption capabilities of vacuum switches. It also offers guidance for the future improvement and development of vacuum circuit breakers."

    "abstract": "Encoding historical traffic scenarios is critical for autonomous driving trajectory prediction. However, existing methods face two fundamental challenges. First, neglecting future interactions leads to myopic predictions. Second, although query-centric paradigms capture multimodal interactions, their typically static query design may limit the adaptability of cross-temporal context fusion. To address these limitations, we propose Miformer, a trajectory prediction model that enhances historical–future spatial–temporal context interactions. First, we introduce a time query mechanism that transforms static agent interactions into dynamic temporal modeling by enabling cross-timestep information exchange between different agents and road geometry. Building upon this temporal foundation, we design a historical–future spatial–temporal interaction module (HF-STIM) that leverages iTransformer to model bidirectional dependencies between past and future contexts. To address the redundancy inherent in inverted embeddings, we further propose the minus-inverted Transformer (Mi-Transformer), which incorporates a dynamic residual learning mechanism to eliminate irrelevant dependencies while preserving critical bidirectional information flow. Finally, we employ a DETR-like decoder to generate diverse multimodal trajectory predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that Miformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION dataset and exhibits competitive performance on the Argoverse dataset. These results highlight its effectiveness in real-world motion prediction.

    "abstract": "For the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, achieving high-performance integrated localization and communication (ILAC) is critical to unlock the full potential of wireless networks. To simultaneously enhance wireless localization and communication performance cost-effectively, this paper proposes sparse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based ILAC with nested and co-prime sparse arrays deployed at the base station (BS). Sparse MIMO relaxes the traditional half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint to enlarge the antenna aperture, thus enhancing localization degrees of freedom (DoFs) and providing finer spatial resolution. However, it also leads to undesired grating lobes, which may cause severe inter-user interference (IUI) for communication and angular ambiguity for localization. While the latter issue can be effectively addressed by the virtual array technology, by forming sum or difference co-arrays via signal (conjugate) correlation among array elements, it is unclear whether the similar virtual array technology also benefits wireless communications for ILAC systems. In this paper, we first reveal that the answer to the above question is negative, by showing that forming virtual arrays for wireless communication will cause destruction of phase information, degradation of signal-to-noise ratio and aggravation of multi-user interference. Therefore, we propose the so-called hybrid processing framework for sparse MIMO based ILAC, i.e., physical array based communication while virtual array based localization. To this end, we characterize the beam pattern of sparse arrays by three metrics, i.e., main lobe beam width, peak-to-local-minimum ratio, and side lobe height, demonstrating that despite of the undesired grating lobes, sparse arrays can also bring benefits to communications, thanks to its narrower main lobe beam width than the conventional compact arrays. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance gains of sparse MIMO based ILAC over that based on the conventional compact MIMO."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving technology is becoming a significant trend in the development of public transportation. A critical task in autonomous driving perception is 3D object detection, which provides essential data support for downstream applications. Most mainstream 3D object detection methods rely on the Cartesian coordinate system, where they construct object queries to interact with image features and position embedding. However, these methods have the following problems: 1) Sensor-captured detail information diminishes with increasing distance, while pixels represent the same space in Cartesian coordinates, preventing the model from fully leveraging details in closer regions. 2) Multi-view images suffer from spatial misalignment due to overlapping fields of view. 3) The performance of existing single-branch depth prediction networks lacks the necessary accuracy. These issues hinder the feature interaction and affect detection performance. We propose an innovative framework PRTF. Based on Polar space, we design the Two-Stage Transformation Encoder: in the first stage, Dual-DepthNet is used to improve the accuracy of depth prediction. In the second stage, Polar points are generated to address spatial misalignment, enabling effective encoding of details at close distance. In the Temporal Decoder, object queries are leveraged to integrate temporal information, effectively compensating for ambiguous information. By enhancing spatial information at both near and far distances in Polar space, the overall performance of multi-view 3D object detection is significantly improved. PRTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes Test with 56.1% mAP and 63.9% NDS, exceeding multi-modal frameworks that combine image and radar data."

Our method uses GCN to embed words’ points and [CLS] point in a sentence, applies template to fuse the sample and residual data to extract features in LLM and attends embedding and feature for In-Context Learning. We evaluated our approach on five Chinese and cross-lingual datasets (Wiki-zh, Stories-zh, News-zh, News-ja, News-ko) under varying data settings (4∼128 shots) and LLM scale (0.5∼7B) settings.

    "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of elastic wave detection mechanisms (WDMs) by an electro-magnetic-acoustic transducer (EMAT) in ferromagnetic media. While various works have focused on elastic wave generation mechanisms (WGMs), WDMs in ferromagnetic materials have received little attention. This study derives a model of these detection mechanisms, by assuming the elastodynamic problem due to the wave passage as a linear perturbation of the initial static equilibrium. The passage of the wave is represented by the induction of three currents, whose origins are identical to those responsible for WGMs: eddy currents, magnetization, and magnetostriction. Maxwell’s equations are solved considering these currents, providing an expression for the induced electromotive force in the EMAT coil. The expression is subsequently reformulated using reciprocity arguments, leading to a result involving only the currents from both generation and detection problems. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze WDMs in relation to various model parameters: 1) the material properties, by examining three ferromagnetic materials (Ni, 30MnB5 and Z20C13), 2) the polarization orientation and magnitude of the permanent magnet, and 3) the lift-off. Simulations reveal a strong dependency of WDMs on these parameters, mirroring the dependencies observed in WGMs."

    "abstract": "This paper tackles indoor receiver localization as a regression task using visible light positioning (VLP). This technology has gained prominence as an alternative to conventional indoor positioning. Traditional systems such as WiFi and ZigBee face notable drawbacks: electromagnetic interference, added infrastructure, limited accuracy, and high deployment costs. In general, classical positioning approaches—lateration, triangulation, proximity, and least squares—typically infer location from measurements like received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), or angle of arrival (AOA). However, in real-world VLP scenarios, these methods face difficulties since they depend on ideal signals, which means unaffected by physical obstacles and perfectly aligned between transmitters and receiver. Our work proposes the application of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, its regularized version (R-ELM) and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA), to predict the receiver’s position based simply on the light signals emitted by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and captured by a photodiode (PD). To evaluate the overall performance of these models, two experimental datasets were used: one in a 2D environment with 7344 RSS samples and another novel in a 3D environment with 27000 training records and 18000 testing samples by analyzing power spectral densities. To assess performance and analyze parameter optimization of ELM, R-ELM, and LMA, metrics such as root mean square error (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE</i>), correlation coefficient (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>), training and testing times were used. By considering the state of the art, the LMA model proved to be the most accurate in the 2D environment (RMSE less than 10 cm), although its training time was excessive (over one hour), incompatible with for real-time applications (time variant channels). In contrast, the R-ELM achieved an accuracy of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE</i> = 12.4806 cm and completed its training in 31.2 ms (real-time learning), positioning it as a much more efficient alternative compared to LMA. For the 3D dataset, the R-ELM also showed the best overall performance, with an average RMSE close to 22.4784 cm and a training time of 1.0250 s. Incorporating both the dominant frequency and power as inputs into the ELM enhanced the model’s accuracy compared to using each input separately. Lastly, RMSE was evaluated as a function of the distance from the center of the room of each data set, concluding that the R-ELM is more stable in areas with weak signals or missing data, which is particularly valuable in real environments where the signal is not always homogeneous. Finally, the results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a precise and fast positioning system based on VLP using the R-ELM, as this model generally achieves higher accuracy and computational efficiency."

This paper presents a wideband pixel-based fluid antenna system (PB-FAS) designed as a general-purpose antenna solution for smart city infrastructures, addressing fundamental challenges in wideband operation, spatial adaptability, interference mitigation, and scalable deployment. The proposed PB-FAS integrates parasitic elements for enhanced bandwidth (6.0-7.0 GHz) and a compact 6-PIN-diode pixel surface enabling 64 distinct fluid states, achieving optimal cost-performance balance.

Visual Graph Querying (VGQ) streamlines this process by enabling users to construct and execute queries via an interactive interface without resorting to complex coding. However, current VGQ tools only allow users to construct simple and specifc query graphs, limiting users' ability to interactively express their query intent, especially for underspecifed query intent. To address these limitations, we propose Envisage, an interactive visual graph querying system to enhance the expressiveness of VGQ in complex query scenarios by supporting intuitive graph structure construction and fexible parameterized rule specifcation. Specifcally, Envisage comprises four stages: Query Expression allows users to interactively construct graph queries through intuitive operations; Query Verifcation enables the validation of constructed queries via rule verifcation and query instantiation; Progressive Query Execution can progressively execute queries to ensure meaningful querying results; and Result Analysis facilitates result exploration and interpretation. To evaluate Envisage, we conducted two case studies and in-depth user interviews with 14 graph analysts. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in constructing, verifying, and executing complex graph queries."

To address the limitations of conventional approaches that rely on tire models and slip angle approximations, a physically grounded tire model is developed that features load-dependent cornering stiffness, relaxation dynamics, and time-varying parameter adaptation. Cornering stiffness is estimated via a regression-based method using only measurable signals, and a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is introduced to estimate the front-rear cornering stiffness. The resulting estimates are integrated into an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) observer for robust sideslip angle estimation under nonlinear and transient conditions. The framework is experimentally validated using a full-scale vehicle equipped with in-wheel motors (IWMs) and lateral tire force sensors. Results confirm that the proposed UKF-based observer achieves accurate and stable sideslip angle estimation during aggressive maneuvers and across varying road surfaces. This approach enables high-fidelity, real-time state estimation for advanced driver-assistance and automated driving applications."

    "abstract": "Fetal brain MRI has become indispensable in prenatal diagnosis, offering unique soft tissue contrast to evaluate cortical development and detect neurological abnormalities. While high-resolution 3D imaging can provide valuable anatomical information, clinical acquisitions are often inadequate for reliable volumetric reconstruction due to unpredictable fetal motion and thick-slice protocols. Conventional iterative reconstruction methods, though effective, are computationally intensive and struggle with severe motion artifacts, limiting their feasibility in fast-paced clinical workflows. At the same time, the scarcity of authentic 3D fetal brain volumes prevents supervised learning approaches from developing generalizable reconstruction models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAFFRON, a physics-informed, label-free self-supervised framework for efficient and high-fidelity 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction. SAFFRON eliminates the need for ground-truth 3D volumes by combining physics-driven slice acquisition modeling with data-driven deep learning, thereby bridging model-based and learning-based paradigms. The reconstruction task is decomposed into two modules: (1) multi-stack motion estimation via an SVR network that aligns slices into a canonical space, and (2) 3D volume reconstruction via an SRR network. Reconstruction quality is further enhanced by two targeted constraints: a stack-level contextual consistency loss to guide more accurate alignment and a slice-level adversarial loss to promote anatomically realistic structures. Extensive experiments on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that SAFFRON substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction accuracy while delivering up to a 60× acceleration in processing speed."

However, existing research typically utilizes only a single sensing channel or performs a simple aggregation of multi-channel data to infer user behavior, without sufficiently leveraging rich spatiotemporal information embedded in the diverse sensing channels. Such a narrow focus of existing works fails to exhibit the real risk of user privacy leakage. To bridge this research gap, we propose HiddenSpy, a comprehensive study assessing the smartphone usage snooping associated with multiple sensing channels, such as accelerometers and magnetometers. We start by examining the relationship between the data gathered from each channel and daily usage behaviors, highlighting information volume differences across channels. Building on this analysis, we propose a multi-layer attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the importance of spatiotemporal information from different channels and time frames, facilitating the efficient use of multi-channel data for behavior inference. Importantly, our work marks a pivotal shift from addressing information leakage in single channels to managing information exposure throughout the smartphone sensing system, laying the foundation for more comprehensive protective measures. To validate our approach, we collect data from forty widely-used applications and evaluate the corresponding usage behavior snooping performance. The results show that HiddenSpy improves accuracy in three common snooping tasks, while its defense mechanism reduces accuracy to a low level, effectively preventing information leakage."

    "abstract": "Cloud-based data sharing has emerged as a prevailing solution for enterprises and end users, supporting various online services in our daily lives. However, the current cloud security solutions are vulnerable to the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat imposed by future quantum computers. To encounter the threat, lattice-based cryptographic solutions for supporting cloud data encryption and search have been extensively investigated by both academia and industry. Despite these efforts, existing lattice-based schemes fall into a trilemma: (1) lack of efficient access control for data retrieval; (2) inadequate protection of keyword privacy in both ciphertext and search token; and (3) difficulty in realizing forward secrecy to safeguard historical data. These limitations result in a substantial burden for lattice-based solutions to be adopted in real-world cloud data sharing. To our knowledge, no prior work has comprehensively addressed these issues at the same time, motivating us to design a more flexible, efficient, and secure lattice-based solution. In this paper, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving, and forward-secure data sharing framework centered around a novel primitive called Forward-Secure Authenticated Searchable Encryption (FS-ASE). Specifically, we first construct an Authenticated Searchable Encryption (ASE) scheme based on ideal lattices, enabling efficient one-to-many search functionality and ensuring keyword privacy in both ciphertext and search token. On top of this primitive, we present the FS-ASE scheme, which achieves forward secrecy through a highly efficient key evolution mechanism, thereby keeping the confidentiality of historical data even if the current secret key is compromised. Finally, the security of our construction is proven under the Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) assumption, and experimental results show that it achieves performance improvements of 158× in data retrieval and 350× in token generation over state-of-the-art approaches, indicating its practicality in real use."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional pose estimation plays a crucial role in fingerprint recognition by facilitating global alignment and reduce pose-induced variations. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory when handling with large angle or small area inputs. These limitations are particularly pronounced on fingerprints captured by under-screen fingerprint sensors in smartphones. In this paper, we present a novel dual-modal input based network for under-screen fingerprint pose estimation. Our approach effectively integrates two distinct yet complementary modalities: texture details extracted from ridge patches through the under-screen fingerprint sensor, and rough contours derived from capacitive images obtained via the touch screen. This collaborative integration endows our network with more comprehensive and discriminative information, substantially improving the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. A decoupled probability distribution prediction task is designed, instead of the traditional supervised forms of numerical regression or heatmap voting, to facilitate the training process. Additionally, we incorporate a Mixture of Experts (MoE) based feature fusion mechanism and a relationship driven cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy to further strengthen feature extraction and fusion capabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets and two private datasets. The results indicate that our method is significantly superior to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and remarkably boosts the recognition ability of fingerprint recognition algorithms.

    "abstract": "The field emission current is a critical factor leading to vacuum gap breakdown, which should be influenced significantly by the materials properties, the electric field distribution and the distance between the vacuum gaps. The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of the materials and the electric field distribution on the field emission characteristics in long vacuum gaps. A two-dimensional axial symmetry simulation model of cathode micro-protrusion was established. Three typical contact materials, including Cu, Cr, and W, were selected. Factors such as electric field, micro-protrusion geometry, and temperature were considered for their influence on emission characteristics. The results reveal that the material properties have a significant influence on the field emission current. For the field emission current density, the order is $\\mathrm{Cr}\\gt \\mathrm{Cu}$ and W, while Cu and W exhibit similar field emission current densities. For the maximum temperatures, the order is $\\mathrm{Cr}\\gt \\mathrm{W}\\gt \\mathrm{Cu}$. Then, the field emission current density, and maximum temperature of the cathode micro-protrusions increase with the rise of the voltage value and increase with the increasing of the aspect ratio of the micro-protrusion."

    "abstract": "Leakage or long-term outgassing can lead to a degradation of the vacuum level within the vacuum interrupter chamber (VIC), thereby compromising the current interruption capability of the vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs). To detect the vacuum level within VCBs, this research analyzes the prebreakdown theory in vacuum gaps and the HFPC methodology for detecting vacuum level within interrupter chambers. Furthermore, it presents an improved experimental method based on the traditional HFPC technique for detecting VCB vacuum level. This approach offers operational simplicity and improved accuracy in vacuum level detection. A key component of this method is a high-frequency high-voltage pulse (HFHVP) power supply featuring adjustable voltage amplitude and frequency. In this study, the circuit design for such a power supply was realized using methods including PWM control, and a prototype HFHVP power supply delivering waveforms meeting experimental specifications was successfully constructed and tested in the laboratory."

In this study, we analyze whether a combination of these metrics can better approximate human evaluation scores. Using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs), we model the relationship between aggregated metric scores and human ratings. While individual metrics show weak alignment with human preferences particularly regarding semantic adequacy and contextual relevance, our results suggest that learned combinations offer modest improvements. Importantly, the interpretability of KANs provides insight into how these metrics interact. Rather than proposing a definitive new metric, this work offers a step toward understanding the limitations of current metrics and motivates the development of more human aligned evaluation methods for code summarization."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for recording brain activity and studying functional connectivity. Since brain electrophysiology is altered in mental disorders, improving health state classification is crucial for better diagnosing conditions like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Given the high dimensionality of EEG signals, effective feature selection is essential for optimizing machine learning models in EEG-based MDD classification. This study evaluates three feature selection methods—variance-based filtering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and LASSO—to enhance classification accuracy. It focuses on EEG-derived functional connectivity metrics, including Pearson’s Correlation (Corr), Phase Locking Value (PLV), Phase Lag Index (PLI), and the Imaginary Part of Coherence (iCoh), across different frequency bands. Results show that variance-based filtering and LASSO significantly improve model performance, particularly in the gamma band (30.0-40.0 Hz) when paired with PLV. Random Forest (RF) outperformed Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, achieving an accuracy of 87.5%. The highest AUC (96.7%) was observed for PLV features selected with LASSO in the gamma band, followed by PLV with variance-based selection (AUC = 92.0%) and Corr with LASSO (AUC = 87.0%). In summary, variance and LASSObased selection methods consistently led to high accuracy and AUC scores, particularly for features extracted using Corr and PLV. RF models performed best across different frequency bands, with the highest accuracy and AUC achieved using PLV features selected with LASSO in the gamma band. PCA-based selection was effective only in specific frequency bands, making it less reliable than variance and LASSO."

    "abstract": "Calculating arc flash incident energy (IE) in battery systems can be significantly improved in both accuracy and practicality. Annex D of NFPA 70E has referenced the maximum power transfer method since 2012, which tends to overestimate IE and has led to the overprescription of personal protective equipment for over a decade. Many alternative methods have been proposed but have been either impractical or inaccurate. This confluence of factors means that many battery systems either do not have arc flash labels or are labeled with an arc flash hazard that, if true, would make regular maintenance tasks impractical. This paper develops a practical battery arc flash model that accounts for electrode erosion and self-extinguishing phenomena in different configurations to predict IE. Self-extinguishing time is predicted by modeling the arc length as a random variable and assuming that the arc will extinguish whenever it exceeds a maximum threshold. The probability distribution of the arc length depends on the electrode configuration and the voltage. The proposed method is substantially more accurate than estab lished methods when they are used to predict the IE measured in 228 battery arc flash tests from published literature. This achievement represents a milestone in battery arc flash modeling that will enable appropriate safety controls to be applied to battery work."

This study examines the influence of training data availability, forecast horizons, and ensemble learning techniques on the accuracy of regional PV power forecasting. A sliding window approach is employed to evaluate model performance over an entire year, capturing the effects of seasonal variations and diverse data conditions. The results show that the amount of available training data, the selected forecast horizon, and the specific combination of base models within ensemble methods substantially influence forecasting accuracy. Crucially, the findings reveal that the effectiveness of an ensemble model is shaped by the learning algorithm and the degree to which its base models are well-suited to the characteristics of the input data and the forecasting timeframe. These insights highlight the need for adaptive ensemble configurations tailored to both data context and prediction objectives, providing practical guidance for the development of more reliable and flexible PV forecasting solutions."

    "abstract": "Metal implants introduce severe artifacts in CT images, compromising diagnostic reliability. Supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) models trained on simulated data are effective but often fail due to domain gaps when applied to real clinical data. Unsupervised methods trained on real images avoid such gaps but suffer from weak artifact suppression and training instability. To address these challenges, we propose d-MAR, a novel MAR framework that performs diffusion-driven domain transformations between simulated and real image domains. Specifically, real image domain (RID) data is transformed into the simulated image domain (SID), processed by a MAR model trained on simulation-paired data, and transformed back into RID. We harness diffusion models as a transformation bridge and introduce two targeted conditional sampling techniques-conditional input and sampling enhancement-based on Fourier-extracted low-frequency image components. This enables domain alignment without random generation, ensuring consistent anatomical fidelity. The proposed d-MAR can reduce real metal artifacts originating from different scanning protocols and devices with a MAR model trained with simulated paired data. Evaluations on Clinical Head, Clinical Body, and dental CBCT datasets show that d-MAR consistently outperforms conventional MAR methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

However, current BCI models face two challenges for motor-impaired patients: 1) prolonged EEG data collection from patients is difficult; 2) differences in brain functional structures and motor behaviors between healthy individuals and patients limit the generalizability of models trained on healthy individuals' EEG data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a transfer learning-based model, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TL-ME</i>, to bridge the gap between healthy individuals' and patients' EEG data and improve movement decoding accuracy for patients. TL-ME integrates an attention-based feature extractor, adversarial domain discriminator, multi-source selection, and movement classifier to transfer knowledge from healthy individuals' EEG data (source domain) to patients' EEG data (target domain). Temporal and spectral visualizations are used to inspect brain activation patterns for shared motor tasks between healthy individuals and patients. Experimental results show a 10.8% improvement in upper-limb movement decoding's accuracy using TL-ME, with each module contributing to performance gains. Visualization analyses also demonstrate similar brain activation patterns across domains, validating the transferability of healthy individuals' EEG data to patient-specific models. This work introduces a novel cross-population transfer learning approach that leverages healthy individuals' EEG data to enhance neural decoding for motor-impaired patients, bridging the gap between experimental studies and real-world applications in BCI-based neurorehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis investigates how the functional interactions between brain regions change over time by identifying recurring connectivity patterns, known as dFC states, and tracking transitions between them. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been used in dFC analysis because it produces non-negative dFC states and coefficients, interpreting dFC states and their transitions straightforwardly. However, existing NMF-based methods are limited to processing dFC data with exclusively positive values, failing to align with the functional correlations and anti-correlations between brain regions. This paper proposes an orthogonal semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (OSemiNMF) method, extending NMF to directly handle mixed-sign dFC data. Furthermore, an orthogonality constraint on the bases (i.e., dFC states) is incorporated to enhance the uniqueness of dFC states. For 10 simulated datasets with varying properties, our method outperforms comparison methods, supporting its superior ability to capture dFC states and state transitions. Using four resting-state fMRI datasets consisting of 708 healthy controls (HCs) and 537 schizophrenia patients (SZs), our method identifies reproducible dFC states and state transitions across datasets. Further, our findings reveal that SZs spend less time in high-connectivity states compared to HCs. Our study identifies meaningful and reproducible biomarkers of schizophrenia, mainly involving the connectivity associated with the sub-cortical domain. In summary, the OSemiNMF method facilitates the dFC analysis for understanding brain dynamics."

    "abstract": "Fetal anatomical structure segmentation in ultrasound images is essential for biometric measurement and disease diagnosis. However, current methods focus on a specific plane or a few structures, whereas obstetricians diagnose by considering multiple structures from different planes. In addition, existing methods struggle with segmenting fuzzy regions, which leads to performance degradation. We propose a real-time segmentation method called Class-aware Multi-structure Instance Segmentation (CMIS), designed to segment 19 key structures in 3 fetal brain planes to support brain-disease diagnosis. We extract instance information and generate class-aware attention for each class instead of dense instances to save computing resources and provide more informative details. Then we implement cross-layer and multi-scale fusion to obtain detailed prototypes. Finally, we fuse global attention with local prototypes cropped by boxes to generate masks and randomly perturb the boxes during training to enhance robustness. Moreover, we propose a new fuzzy region-based constraint loss to address the challenge of structures with varying scales and fuzzy boundaries. Extensive experiments on a fetal brain dataset demonstrate that CMIS outperforms 13 competing baselines, with an mDice of 83.41<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula>0.03% at 37 FPS.

However, diverse building morphologies and similar backscattering characteristics in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery pose significant challenges for multi-category built-up area classification. To address this, we established the Built-up Area Classification Dataset (BACD) using Ku-band AIRSAT-01 satellite data, which includes three categories: low-rise, high-rise, and metal-roofed structure areas. Based on BACD, we propose an Attention-enhanced Multi-scale Feature Fusion Network (AMFFNet) for classification. The model incorporates a Dual Attention Inverted Residual Block to enhance building feature extraction. In the decoder, an Atrous Spatial Pyramid and Pyramid Pooling Module is combined with attention mechanisms to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate that AMFFNet achieves 73.53% mean Intersection over Union on BACD, significantly outperforming mainstream segmentation models including U-Net, Fast-SCNN, OCRNet, PSPNet, and SegFormer, and exceeding the second-best model by 6.3 percentage points. Generalization experiments on geographically distinct regions further confirm the robustness of AMFFNet across diverse urban environments. This study validates the feasibility of SAR imagery for multi-category built-up area classification and provides both a valuable dataset and a high-accuracy model for urban monitoring and land management applications."

However, compared with isolated chargers, they inherently suffer from higher leakage currents, raising safety concerns. To address these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage non-isolated bidirectional on-board charger in which both stages collaboratively suppress leakage current. The proposed architecture employs a Bidirectional Clamping Highly Efficient and Reliable Inverter Concept (BDC-HERIC) topology as the AC/DC stage and a symmetrical buck converter as the DC/DC stage, achieving substantial leakage current reduction. The control strategy ensures unity power factor and enables Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) operation. By maintaining a constant common-mode voltage, the proposed system achieves approximately a tenfold reduction in leakage current. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed topology are verified through both MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware experiments, confirming its superior efficiency and compliance with safety standards."

    "abstract": "The intricate structure and frequent online reconfiguration of low-voltage distribution lines result in massive, multi-version dynamic topologies that are challenging to acquire and analyze for operational applications. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic topology characterization method for distribution grid based on a graph-relationship hybrid model. A mapping strategy between line topology and graph models is designed to construct a static topology graph of the distribution grid. The calculation logic for node connection weights is defined by considering the distribution characteristics of switches between devices, thereby generating a graph node similarity matrix. Spectral clustering algorithms are employed to segment the topology graph to reduce the complexity of dynamic topology graph updates. The adaptive generation of connecting edges between dynamic topology nodes is achieved by decomposing the measurement state sequence features of switch-type devices. The graph-relation model incorporates a trade-off between the computational performance across topological versions and the storage efficiency of massive measurement data, thereby resolving the challenge of representing dynamic topologies under highfrequency, large-scale data influx. The efficiency of the proposed method in topology analysis scenarios is validated using low-voltage topology data from a regional distribution grid, with analysis cases including topology version backtracking, power supply range analysis, and real-time connectivity. For these scenarios, the topology computation time has been compressed to below the low-voltage equipment’s measurement interval, which enables real-time updates and rapid calculations of dynamic topologies."

However, in large-scale, complex, and dynamic 3D environments, uncertain sensor information and unexpected obstacles pose serious challenges to UAV flight safety, thereby necessitating robust and fast-responding trajectory optimization methods. This study presents a hierarchical trajectory generation and optimization scheme for UAV-assisted MEC in complex environments. Different from existing works, our scheme incorporates constraints from the UAV’s realistic dynamics model and a communication-computation energy consumption model. A global trajectory is first generated using an improved cost-function-based rapidly-exploring random tree star (RRT*) algorithm, followed by refinement via nonlinear model predictive control for high-precision smoothing. In addition, an attention-enhanced double deep Q-network (DDQN) module is employed as the high-level controller within the hierarchical trajectory optimization framework, providing optimized obstacle avoidance strategies in the presence of uncertain obstacles. Simulation results show that: 1) Compared with traditional approaches, the proposed scheme generates trajectories that demonstrate improved smoothness while rigorously satisfying physical and safety constraints, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of flight operations; and 2) in scenarios involving uncertain obstacles, the proposed framework effectively balances multiple objectives, including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance safety, and energy consumption, leading to more robust and cost-effective aerial operation performance."

    "abstract": "Understanding haptic interactions between fingers and piano keys is essential for uncovering the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying piano performance. In the present study, we developed a sensor-integrated piano keyboard capable of monitoring three-dimensional (3D) forces applied to the keys, achieved by embedding MEMS sensor devices in both white and black keys spanning an entire octave (C4 to C5). The system captures both vertical (depressing) and horizontal (frictional) forces, offering novel insights into how pianists utilize friction to execute complex finger movements in playing note sequences and chords. We describe the system's design and functionality, and present representative results demonstrating its capabilities. Our findings reveal that the temporal profiles of both vertical and horizontal forces contain rich information about physical mechanisms underlying pianistic skills. Moreover, we report novel observations of the dynamic force interaction between the fingers and key surfaces. This system offers a valuable tool for analyzing the sensorimotor foundations of pianistic skills and for providing objective data to support piano pedagogy."

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development of a high-efficiency computational model for predicting the magnetic field of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which is crucial for the design and optimization of HTS-based devices. A fast-computational model for magnetic field was proposed, leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of the deep residual neural network (ResNet). To validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model, a prototyped HTS magnet system was employed for experimental verification. The comparison between the calculation results and the experimental data demonstrated a high degree of consistency, confirming the practical applicability of the model. Subsequently, an enhanced linear adaptive genetic algorithm was introduced for the optimization design of a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet utilizing REBCO superconducting tapes. The optimized magnet is composed of 60 double-pancake coils, operating at a cryogenic temperature of 30 K and featuring a coil inner diameter of 600 mm. An active shielding technique was adopted, which involves the strategic arrangement of additional coils to counteract the stray magnetic fields. Through this approach, the fringing field was effectively suppressed. In terms of field homogeneity, the magnet achieved 74 ppm within a 250 mm diameter spherical volume (DSV)."

These magnets often include multiple demountable joints, which typically incorporate low temperature solder either in the joint itself or in the cable. Such solders usually contain elements that diffuse readily in copper, raising concerns about the aging effects. This study investigates the impact of the InterMetallic-Compound (IMC) growth on the joints properties through room-temperature aging and annealing. Eutectic indium-tin solder joints stored for nine months in a desiccator did not exhibit any significant change in their properties. Given the strong temperature dependence of the IMC growth, annealing at 100°C was performed to simulate long-term effects. After 6 to 8 days of annealing, critical current degradation was measured in all samples containing solder, indicating that the IMC had grown to the REBCO layer deteriorating it. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses revealed that even after 20 days, solder elements reached the REBCO layer only in regions where the solder was abundant."

    "abstract": "Urban mobility systems are growing increasingly complex due to rapid urbanization, evolving transportation demands, and rising congestion levels, which lead to travel delays and increased environmental impact. These challenges underscore the importance of developing advanced modeling, monitoring, and management approaches that can capture the dynamics of urban mobility systems and support more efficient, sustainable and adaptive transportation solutions. Mobility Digital Twin (MoDT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for monitoring, managing, and predicting urban mobility by maintaining a synchronized digital replica of the transportation system and enabling feedback to the physical infrastructure. However, most existing MoDT implementations remain fragmented, and tightly bound to specific use cases, limiting scalability, reusability, and broader applicability. This paper presents FlowTwin, a comprehensive methodology and software framework for developing a MoDT for traffic flow monitoring. The proposed approach introduces a dual-phase methodology: an offline phase for modeling and calibration using macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models to capture both aggregate and fine-grained driver dynamics; and an online phase that enables simulation, monitoring, and feedback generation. The presented architecture is aligned with the capabilities proposed by Digital Twin Consortium, ensuring structured design and extensibility. The feasibility and effectiveness of FlowTwin are validated through its instantiation in the Italian city of Bologna, resulting in BoMoDT. BoMoDT operates on traffic flow streams generated by a city-scale emulator built from real-world mobility data, enabling continuous monitoring, simulation, and feedback within a realistic but controlled environment. Quantitative evaluations confirm BoMoDT’s capability to support accurate traffic simulation and responsive monitoring under diverse traffic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to be susceptible to imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Many studies aim to interpret adversarial examples in the frequency domain. However, existing research often relies on a limited number of datasets, models, and adversarial attacks, leading to incomplete conclusions. Moreover, a quantitative interpretation of adversarial examples remains lacking. This paper proposes a quantitative frequency-based framework to comprehensively investigate adversarial examples, where six kinds of attacks against naturally and adversarially trained models across three datasets are adopted. Initially, our framework visualizes the distributions of successful adversarial perturbations in the frequency domain to locate their target regions. Subsequently, we characterize the importance of perturbations contained in different frequency bands and define adversarially effective frequency bands (AEFBs). Furthermore, we leverage the identified AEFBs to enhance two query-based black-box adversarial attacks. Our experimental results uncover the varying characteristics of adversarial perturbations, which are analyzed from dataset-level, model-level, and attack-level perspectives. After reordering frequency bands and identifying AEFBs, we further demonstrate that adversarial attacks guided by AEFBs can achieve superior performance, verifying their effectiveness and generalization. These significant findings contribute to a deeper understanding of adversarial examples and provide valuable insights for future research."

    "abstract": "Miniaturization of electronic devices and the consequent reduction in pitch can increase the risks of short circuit failures due to electrochemical migration (ECM). Water drop test (WDT) is one of the most widely used methods for ECM studies. However, the volume of the electrolyte used in WDT has not been standardized yet. This work investigates the effects of varying electrolyte volume on the ECM of tin (Sn) in WDT, using a two-probe semiconductor characterization system (SCS). The volume of the electrolyte was varied from 5 μL to 100 μL. The electrolytes used for this study are NaCl solutions (0.1, 1, and 10 mM), which are commonly used electrolytes for ECM studies. Results show that the electrolyte volume does not affect the time to failures (TTF) of Sn at low and medium Cl-. concentrations (0.1 mM and 1 mM). However, at a high Cl-. concentration (10 mM), the TTF increases as the electrolyte volume increases. Results further show that the electrolyte volume and Cl. concentration influence the hydrodynamic conditions of the electrolyte during WDT. The synergistic effects of the electrolyte volume, Cl-. concentration, and hydrodynamic conditions in the electrolyte on the ECM behavior of Sn are elucidated."

    "abstract": "In Visual Sensor Networks (VSNs), the generation and transmission of a large quantity of image data lead to huge network traffic. As a result, their lifetime is short and their delay is long. Therefore, reducing their traffic is critical to prolonging their lifetime and shortening their latency. Since the feature data of an image is much smaller than raw data, deploying processing nodes near camera nodes to extract the features of their images for transmission can greatly reduce network traffic. Moreover, installing camera nodes of multiple types can also help, since their use can decrease the total size of images. This work comprehensively utilizes these two measures and investigates how to deploy a heterogeneous VSN to satisfy sampling frequency requirements of targets and gather features of their images while minimizing the network deployment cost and meeting the network lifetime requirement. We formulate this important and new problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program and propose a separate node deployment algorithm and a joint one to solve it. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that both success rate and solution quality of the latter are higher than those of the former at the expense of computational time."

    "abstract": "Bearing fault detection is essential for machinery health management. An issue of existing work is that the network trained with a publicly available dataset (source domain) often has a large accuracy drop when applied to a target machine (target domain), since the source domain and target domain originate from different machines, and thus exhibit significant differences in data distribution. Besides, in real industrial processes, collecting large amounts of fault data from the target machine is unrealistic. To address the above issues, a target domain one-class learning bearing fault detection framework (TDOCL-BFDF) is proposed in this article inspired by the distribution discrepancy between the normal and the fault data. Firstly, a new three-stage training-initializing scheme, which fully utilizes data from source and target domains, is designed for the TDOCL-BFDF to extract features from the target normal data and increase the distribution discrepancy between the normal and the fault data. Secondly, a Gaussian fault detector (GFD)—serving as a critical performance-enhancing module of the TDOCL-BFDF model is proposed to mitigate the scale imbalance across the dimensions of latent features. The proposed framework is evaluated using four bearing datasets (three public and one in-house dataset) and achieves an accuracy of 0.990-1.0 in all the fault detection tasks. The results show that the TDOCL-BFDF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and manifests the great potential of the proposed TDOCL-BFDF for real industrial application scenarios."

Various frequency transmission technology has a broad application prospect in the different power systems. The objective of this paper is to investigate the anode erosion, deformation and temperature distribution in high-current vacuum arcs under various frequencies. The model incorporated heat transfer from arc plasma to anode surface and phase change of anode materials. The simulation results indicate that lower frequency results in delayed crater initiation, slower early-stage development, ultimately leading to larger final crater dimensions. During the arcing process, the maximum temperature on the anode surface reaches 1920 K at $50 \\mathrm{~Hz}, 2860 \\mathrm{~K}$ at 20 Hz, and 2880 K at 15 Hz. Under lowfrequency arc erosion, craters exhibit a saturation trend in dimensions over time during later stages of development, with lower frequency leading to a more pronounced saturation trend and longer duration."

The results indicate that breakdown energy significantly influences the conditioning effect, with an optimal energy range existing for achieving the best conditioning performance.

    "abstract": "The complexity of brain anatomy and the scarcity of annotated data pose significant challenges to detecting pathologies in the brain scans using supervised deep learning approaches. In contrast, unsupervised anomaly detection is not constrained by annotated requirements by leveraging generative models to construct healthy references for pathological images and identifies anomalies through pixel-wise comparisons. Nevertheless, existing generative models still suffer from insufficient accuracy in reconstructing the fine-grained anatomical details of the brain. Inspired by the image restoration model DIffIR, in this study we propose AnoDiffIR, a novel hybrid unsupervised anomaly detection architecture, which synergizes diffusion priors with generative reconstruction. Specifically, AnoDiffIR consists of Dual-Domain Masking CutMix (DDMC), Hierarchical Feature Extraction Network (HFENet), Dynamic IR Transformer (DIRformer), and a denoising network. Our method employs a two-stage progressive training strategy. In the first pre-training stage, pseudo-lesion data generated by DDMC prompts HFENet to extract and decouple healthy prior features, which can constrain the reconstruction process of DIRformer. In the second stage, the diffusion model inversely derives healthy priors from pathological inputs, which are jointly optimized with DIRformer outputs to refine anomaly maps. We evaluated our method on brain tumor and multiple sclerosis datasets, and the result demonstrates the superiority of our method compared to existing baseline approaches."

The proposed methodology of the DCMG components preserves dynamics, dimension, and structure as that of the individual components of the DCMG. The aggregated model would be helpful to analyze the dynamics of the DCMG clusters connected to the grid through bidirectional power electronic interface and its effects during disturbances. With more penetration from solar photovoltaics, batteries, and loads, the aggregate model is computationally less intensive than the detailed model. The paper proposed different scaling parameters for the DCMG components and shows that the detailed and aggregate models have identical structures and dynamics, which have been mathematically proved via necessary and sufficient theorems. Further, extensive simulation studies have been carried out in MATLAB/Simulink to validate and compare the effectiveness in terms of computational time and applicability of the aggregate model with respect to the detailed model. The results have also been verified in real-time using an EMT-based Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) on a standard IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 34-bus network with multiple DCMG clusters."

    "abstract": "2D X-ray radiography is a widely used medical imaging technique due to its low cost, rapid acquisition, and low radiation exposure. However, X-ray images are limited to the 2D plane, making it difficult for physicians to visualize and assess the 3D anatomical information. We present Pixel2Voxel, a method to reconstruct 3D volume from a limited number (1 or 2) of 2D X-ray images for the visualization of 3D anatomical structures. Our approach backprojects the local image features onto their corresponding voxels and aggregates the 2D features from the images to get the 3D geometry-aware volume features. To address the inherent ambiguity stemming from sparse input data, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model that seamlessly integrates with the 3D volume features. This integration significantly enhances our model's ability to generate high-fidelity and geometrically consistent 3D volumes. Furthermore, we propose an iterative refinement method that substantially improves the reconstruction quality. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on real patient datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in 3D reconstruction compared to recent methods. Besides, we evaluate our method's capabilities in 3D organ shape reconstruction and volume measurement. Our promising results showcase its great potential across various medical applications, augmenting 2D X-rays by enabling assessment and visualization of 3D anatomical information, such as organ shape, size, and location, with lower cost and lower radiation exposure of X-rays."

Based on lateral heat flux and transient thermal simulations, a parameter extraction method for solving circuit partial differential equations has been proposed, which leads to determination of lateral thermal capacitance. It has been validated that lateral thermal capacitance is independent of loss and environmental temperature but is related to the convective heat transfer coefficient <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">htc</i>.

By establishing an accurate two-dimensional axisymmetric model of the VI, the influences of the main shield length, intermediate shield length, and corrugated tube shield length on the floating shield electric field strength, porcelain surface electric field strength, and maximum electric field strength in the VI were systematically analyzed. It was demonstrated that the maximum electric field strength is concentrated in the contact area, with the vicinity of the contacts being the weak point of insulation. Furthermore, the optimal shield dimensions for the 126kV VI were determined: the main shield length is 298 mm, the intermediate shield length is 80 mm, and the corrugated tube shield length is 85 mm."

Simulations using a Mo cathode-Al anode vacuum ion source show that in cathode arc discharge mode, cathode-generated plasma forms discharge circuits to the anode and emits through the anode aperture as products. Off-center cathode discharge induces discharge path shift and arc parameter changes. In cathode-anode collaborative discharge mode with active anode vapor generation, anode-generated particles participate in discharge and contribute to multielement ion source products."

Experimental deployment in a real-world multi-storey building environment confirmed the system robustness in the presence of electrical and mechanical noise, validating its suitability for practical condition monitoring applications. Furthermore, simulation-based fault injection using synthetic signals confirmed that the system’s lightweight rule-based logic could successfully identify abnormal signal patterns associated with common mechanical and electrical faults. These findings support the claim that fault prediction workflows typically confined to high-resource settings can be adapted and validated on minimalist embedded platforms."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-scale service resilience optimization (MSSRO) method for SIN based on distributed agent self-healing. Our method solves the problem of relying on ground network control to achieve failed nodes and service recovery, and innovatively achieves autonomous service recovery capability through the remaining performance of satellite systems. Compared with traditional manual recovery methods for satellite system services, this method can improve the system service recovery effect by 31% after node failure, and shorten the service recovery time by 30.7% compared to random recovery methods. MSSRO significantly enhances the service resilience and adaptability of SIN in scenarios involving random interference or malicious attacks."

    "abstract": "This study proposes an innovative temperature measurement technique for flowing water, which uses the sound of pouring water to determine its temperature, thereby providing a non-contact temperature sensing technology. It is found that when water is poured from one container into another, different water temperatures cause subtle differences in the pouring sound. Therefore, we can use a microphone to record the sound generated during the pouring process and then determine the temperature of the water as it falls based on the recorded sound. Compared to most contact-based temperature sensors currently used to measure liquid temperature, this technique has the advantage of not causing contact contamination or affecting the water temperature. It can also be designed as an App on a handheld mobile device, where the built-in microphone records the sound to recognize the water temperature, thus eliminating the need for additional hardware costs. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of pouring sounds across three temperature classes (cold, warm, and hot) and extracted acoustic features such as MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) and Mel-spectrograms. A deep learning model, ATRNet (Audio-based Temperature Recognition Network), was proposed and benchmarked against CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network), VGGish architecture, and SVM (Support Vector Machines) using different input durations and noise conditions. Experimental results show that ATRNet with combined MFCCs and Mel-spectrogram features achieves state-of-the-art performance, up to 100% accuracy on clean post-full segments and strong robustness under noise. Even with short audio segments (3s and 5s), the system maintains competitive accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real-time and embedded applications. These results confirm the feasibility of using impact sound during water pouring for practical, non-contact temperature recognition."

    "abstract": "Speech enhancement is crucial for reliable communication in noisy environments. However, the lack of a priori knowledge about target speech characteristics in conventional systems often leads to erroneous extraction of interfering speech as desired signals during noise suppression, significantly compromising system performance. Recently, researchers have proposed to use the side-channel signal as an assist to denoise noisy speech. This paper proposes BoneSE, a multimodal speech enhancement approach using bone conduction. The basic idea of BoneSE is to perceive the bone-conducted sound with an IMU sensor embedded in the Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) earphone and then leverage the correlations between the bone conduction signal and audio signal for speech enhancement. However, the lack of high-frequency components in the IMU modality brings data imbalance and hinders data fusion. To address this challenge, we explore and model the relationship between multimodal signals and design a fusion module according to the time and frequency correlation. Moreover, to balance fast processing and denoising performance, we propose bone conduction-based noise level metrics to measure the noise level. To accommodate different noise levels, we propose an adaptive model selection approach based on reinforcement learning to select the proper denoising model, thereby optimizing the latency. Experiments on two datasets show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods and can enhance speech in low SNR scenarios."

To address these challenges, this paper presents an adaptive coordination exploration approach for multi-UAV systems. In the proposed approach, dynamic region allocation, entropy-guided local planning, and direction-consistent frontier selection are integrated to achieve efficient and collaborative exploration. The system first partitions the environment adaptively based on workload and regional complexity. It then prioritizes high-information-value areas for exploration. Directional constraints are further applied to improve path continuity and reduce turning redundancy. Extensive experiments in indoor maze and pillar environments, and outdoor forest and urban environments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the necessity and complementarity of each module. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for multi-UAV exploration in structured and unstructured environments."

    "abstract": "Due to the thermal imaging mechanism, infrared images are inevitably contaminated by thermal radiation bias fields. Correcting this low-frequency non-uniformity is challenging because the bias field is difficult to separate from the low-frequency scene content. Existing methods fit parametric surface models to estimate bias fields. However, variations in camera operating states and environment often lead to irregular bias field that such surface models cannot accurately capture. This paper proposes a novel model-free method for irregular bias field correction. The proposed method utilizes the normalized deconvolution module to restore the clean image in the probability density function (PDF) domain, in which the PDF of the bias field can be approximated by a series of specific Gaussian kernel functions. Accordingly, the complete bias field could be obtained gradually in the PDF domain by incremental updating. To transform the image PDF back to the intensity domain, the corresponding conditional expectation is computed in this paper. Note that the proposed method does not require any explicit parametric modeling of the bias field. Therefore, the proposed method is able to correct irregular bias fields effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model-free method outperforms existing methods in synthesized and real infrared images."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of multimodal medical images with missing modalities remains a critical challenge due to incomplete data often encountered in clinical practice. Lack of modality-specific information often leads to significant performance degradation in scenarios with severely missing modalities. To address this problem, we focus on modeling the relationships between modality-specific features. We propose a joint representation learning framework, named as Cyclic Contrastive Latent Representation Segmentation (CLRS), which incorporates cyclic modality-specific representation generation and contrastive feature alignment for robust 3D medical image segmentation under missing modality conditions. CLRS first extracts feature from available modalities using a unified encoder, then generates missing latent representations conditioned on the encoded features via an elaborately designed synthesis strategy. Meanwhile, a channel-wise attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the specific features of the modality. In addition, modality-specific contrastive learning enforces cross-modal discrimination between the generated and encoded representations, which effectively disentangles modality-specific information from shared patterns and enhances the segmentation robustness in missing modality scenarios. Extensive experiments on three 3D multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLRS, particularly in scenarios with severe modality absence. For instance, with only a single modality available on ProstateZS dataset, CLRS improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by over 4.06% for peripheral zone, 2.20% for central gland.

Here, we propose a novel bifacial architecture featuring monolithically integrated 2-terminal (2T) tandem photovoltaic structures on both the front and rear surfaces. Unlike conventional designs with a single illuminated tandem stack, our back-to-back configuration employs complete tandem subcells on each side, enabling independent spectral optimization for incident and reflected light. The rear-facing 2T tandem comprises an all-perovskite stack with narrow (1.20 eV) and wide (1.60 eV) bandgap absorbers optimized for albedo harvesting. The front-facing 2T tandem integrates the same wide-bandgap perovskite with a silicon heterojunction (1.12 eV) bottom cell. Current matching in each stack is achieved by tailoring the absorber thicknesses. Device performance is numerically evaluated using SCAPS-1D simulations across four surface types: soil, sand, concrete, and snow. On highly reflective surfaces like snow, the design yields a power conversion efficiency of up to 47% and a bifacial efficiency gain (BEG) of 73%. This architecture also provides enhanced design flexibility through asymmetric bandgap tuning, optical filtering, and angular light management. Our results highlight a new design paradigm for next-generation bifacial solar cells with significantly improved performance and versatility."

However, it suffers from high complexity and long worst-case decoding latency, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). To address these issues, this letter proposes TS-SCLF, an SCLF decoder that employs a dual-threshold strategy and segmented CRC to reduce latency. The proposed dual-threshold strategy dynamically skips redundant flipping attempts through historical failure pattern analysis, while employing Gaussian distribution-inspired path metric thresholds to enable early successive cancellation list (SCL) termination. Furthermore, a deep Q-network (DQN) framework is applied to optimize the threshold parameters, achieving a good balance between complexity and error performance. Experimental results show that for a (1024,512) polar code, TS-SCLF reduces the average number of decoding attempts by up to 55.3% at low SNRs compared with state-of-the-art counterparts, while preserving error correction performance."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive analysis of discharge initiation within the multipactor-free zones of susceptibility chart owing to dielectric charging. Simulations of the multipactor effect in both one-sided and two-sided dielectric-loaded parallel-plate waveguides reveal that positive dielectric charging affects the transit time of electrons, causing them to transition into the third-order double-surface multipactor (DSMP) mode and facilitating resonant conditions. Consequently, the prolonged bidirectional transit time in two-sided dielectric-loaded waveguides enables the initiation and saturation of multipactor discharge throughout the multipactor-inactive region. In contrast, in one-sided dielectric-loaded waveguides, the asymmetric electrostatic field limits secondary electron generation to specific parameter domains, thereby restricting the spatial expansion of the discharge. In this case, secondary electron avalanche is confined to localized areas within multipactor-inactive regions near the third-order DSMP regions in the one-sided dielectric-loaded rectangular waveguide, while it extends across the entire multipactor-inactive regions in the two-sided dielectric-loaded rectangular waveguide. The numerical findings have been validated by EM-PIC simulations."

    "abstract": "Linear embeddings support interactive visual exploration by mapping high-dimensional (nD) data into a two-dimensional space. Despite their popularity, selecting meaningful projection parameters remains a key challenge due to the infinite 2n-dimensional parameter space. Once an informative projection is found, users often seek similar ones that emphasize specific items differently while preserving global structure. For instance: Do clusters become outliers under slight changes? Can grouped items separate-or merge-through parameter adjustments? Which changes to the embedding parameters lead to such projections - and do they exist at all? Answering these questions efficiently is critical for effective visual search. Yet, current methods-such as projection tours or manual parameter tuning-are time-consuming and risk overlooking important views, including those of specific interest. We propose Composition Operators, a mathematical foundation for a novel set-of-point manipulation concept for linear embeddings-such as Star Coordinates-as an alternative approach to selecting informative embedding parameters in a more controllable manner with respect to the desired outcome. Users specify item-based constraints on the projection result; the corresponding 2n parameters are then derived automatically, eliminating the need to exhaustively search the entire parameter space to get a similar outcome. Neither the embedding space nor the set of parameters is altered - only the mechanism for navigating and selecting parameters is redefined. We provide closed-form solutions for this and demonstrate our interactive prototype on nD datasets from the UCI repository."

    "abstract": "Initiatives to decarbonize contemporary power systems will lead to power systems dominated by inverter-based resources (IBR). These IBRs are broadly classified into grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverter control regimes. In this paper, a small-signal state-space model is formulated for a 100% IBR-dominated power system. This formulation is then used to perform stability analysis on the IEEE 9-bus system. The analysis thoroughly investigates the impacts of varying GFM inverter penetration on system stability. The paper also discusses the system behavior in the wake of varying shares of different GFL inverter control schemes. The cause of instability is ascertained by investigating the participation factor of each component. Moreover, the paper examines the effects of phase-locked loop (PLL) and power synchronization loop (PSL) parameters on determining the minimum GFM penetration necessary for ensuring stable system operation. It has been found that the inverter type with the highest capacity is not always the biggest contributor to instability. Also, increasing the proportional coefficient and decreasing the integral coefficient of the PLL of GFL inverters allow the system to be operated under lower GFM penetration. Similarly, increasing the moment of inertia or damping coefficient of the GFM inverter’s power synchronization loop has a similar effect. The conclusions and the underlying theoretical analysis are verified by time-domain simulations of electromagnetic transient (EMT) models in Matlab/Simulink."

Existing methods, often reliant on monolithic feature representations or simplistic similarity metrics, struggle with spatial deformations, fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships, and suffer from efficiency degradation at scale. To address these issues, we propose HALO, a Hierarchical Adaptive Latent Optimization framework. HALO introduces: (1) a multi-component similarity metric that integrates semantic object alignment, spatial relationship modeling, and attribute-level descriptors for comprehensive comparison; and (2) an adaptive index partitioning strategy employing manifold-aware decomposition and residual quantization to accelerate retrieval. Extensive experiments on COCO and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving mean Average Precision (mAP) while maintaining substantially faster query speeds on large-scale databases."

    "abstract": "Sparse tensors are prevalent in real-world applications, often characterized by their large-scale, high-order, and high dimensional nature. Directly handling raw tensors is impractical due to the significant memory and computational overhead involved. The current mainstream approach involves compressing or decomposing the original tensor. One popular tensor decomposition algorithm is the Tucker decomposition. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale Tucker decomposition typically relax the original optimization problem into multiple convex optimization problems to ensure polynomial convergence. Unfortunately, these algorithms tend to converge slowly. In contrast, tensor decomposition exhibits a simple optimization landscape, making local search algorithms capable of converging to a global (approximate) optimum much faster. In this paper, we propose the FastTuckerPlus algorithm, which decomposes the original optimization problem into two non-convex optimization problems and solves them alternately using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method. Furthermore, we introduce cuFastTuckerPlusTC, a fine-grained parallel algorithm designed for GPU platforms, leveraging the performance of tensor cores. This algorithm minimizes memory access overhead and computational costs, surpassing the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 2× to 8× improvement in convergence speed and a 3× to 5× improvement in per-iteration execution speed compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

    "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders that affects school-age children. Although various treatments are currently available for ADHD, immediate and automated strategies for managing classroom behavior in children with ADHD are still limited. This study introduces an artificial intelligence (AI) empowered vest to monitor classroom activity and provide real-time vibration interventions to help manage hyperactive behavior. The vest integrates two inertial measurement units to collect behavioral data, and a neural network classifies it as typical or hyperactive. The vibration motor will be activated to remind the children to adjust their posture after detecting hyperactive behavior. A controlled experiment was conducted with 40 children aged 7-12 years to evaluate the accuracy of the vest behavior classification and the effectiveness of its vibration-based intervention. Each child attended the same lesson with three sections in the pre-test and the post-test. Vibration interventions were introduced during the post-test in the second and third sections. The teacher used a five-point scale to rate the children’s performance in each section. The classification and intervention accuracy on the test set was 0.84. A significant reduction in activity level was observed after the vibration intervention, and teacher performance ratings improved significantly in sections with the intervention (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test). These findings suggest that the proposed system provides a promising real-time solution for behavioral intervention in classroom settings."

    "abstract": "Forecasting multivariate time series has many real-world applications involving controlling the systems as well as dimensioning and planning their growth. The key difference from univariate time series is that the channel cross-correlations can be exploited to achieve forecasting with higher accuracy at the cost of possibly much larger complexity. On the other hand, simple techniques such as DLinear achieve very good performance, and they can be used also for multivariate time series by simply ignoring the spatial channe dependencies. Furthermore and importantly, the data pre-processing has a significant impact upon the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, a novel pre-processing strategy for multivariate time series is considered to extract the relevant spatio-temporal features for subsequent downstream processing including sample forecasting. Specifically, the time series are first spatially re-ordered into a longitudinal data matrix. The data matrix is then uniformly sliced into equal-size sub-matrices, which are referred to here as data symbols. The data symbols are further decomposed into the 2D regression trends and symbols of residual noises akin to empirical mode decomposition. The symbol size is chosen, so that the residual noise is approximately stationary. The concatenated features represent a transformed time series, which can be forecasted using channel-independent methods such as DLinear. Assuming EEG data and four forecasting accuracy metrics, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pre-procesing outperforms other channel-independent forecasting methods for multivariate time series across different forecasting horizons. In addition, the numerical results indicate that the forecasting accuracy is dependent on the frequency sub-band of EEG data considered."

We propose a hybrid MLPCNN neural network-based classification system for discerning between legitimate users’ spontaneous speech and spoofed speech, according to the three types of attacks mentioned. Two datasets were leveraged for developing the system: ASVspoof 2019 (used for training, validation, and evaluation) and ASVspoof 2021 (only for additional evaluation).

The results show that: 1) At the macroeconomic level, increasing the import tariff on copper resources positively influences GDP through industrial linkage mechanisms, but this is accompanied by adverse environmental consequences, such as increased carbon emissions. 2) At the industrial level, the tariff policy has differentiated supply-and-demand effects on the copper mining industry: on the supply side, there is a substitution effect whereby import constraints stimulate domestic capacity expansion; on the demand side, demand remains relatively stable due to the rigid demand in industrial production. 3) Policy simulations indicate that while significantly higher copper import tariffs can effectively reduce import dependence, they do so at the risk of depleting domestic reserves, thereby jeopardizing medium- to long-term resource security. To ensure copper resource security, China should build a diversified system by boosting recycled copper utilization and increasing domestic exploration to enhance reserves."

To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding dataset-adaptive DRworkflow. Finally, we empirically show that our dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR optimization without compromising accuracy."

Alternatively, we exploit large language models (LLMs) to design a novel SCBSS method, including a new LLM-based deep neural network (DNN), and a new fine-tuning algorithm. By harnessing the extremely powerful feature extraction and cross-domain knowledge transfer capabilities of LLMs, our method can effectively separate target signals from full-band jamming after fine-tuning with a small number of labeled data samples.

    "abstract": "In recent years, phishing scams have caused huge economic losses in Ethereum, the largest blockchain platform enabling smart contracts. Many new sorts of phishing attacks based on smart contracts, specifically targeting Ethereum assets such as Ether and tokens, are emerging. Existing Ethereum phishing detection methods usually mine the transaction relationships among accounts from block data, while neglecting to mine the temporal transaction patterns inherent in the accounts themselves in different transaction types introduced by smart contracts. Such information provides a new perspective for analyzing account transaction preferences. However, since this information is hidden in heterogeneous data such as trace data and event logs, it is difficult to analyze and mine the information. In this paper, we contribute Trans2Graph, a novel graph-based framework for Ethereum data modeling and phishing detection, to fully exploit the massively heterogeneous temporal transaction data. We propose a new paradigm for the fusion of heterogeneous Ethereum data and model the implicit transition relationships among multiple heterogeneous transactions of each Ethereum account into a heterogeneous, temporal, directed multigraph called transaction state transition graph. Empirical analysis shows that phishing accounts have unique patterns in both the heterogeneity and time dynamics of transaction state transition graphs. Based on the analysis, we develop a novel attention-based graph neural network for the learning of heterogeneous temporal state transition graphs and phishing detection. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that Trans2Graph achieves a minimum 52.57% improvement in the average precision metric on state-of-the-art account interaction graph-based methods and a minimum 11.52% improvement in average precision on transaction sequence-based methods."

Notwithstanding the multifaceted nature of this arrangement, most client models are completely fundamental. As the need might arise, most client conduct investigation models ignore such endless proper factors that the gauges they make are overall not altogether strong. This paper plans to encourage a connection rule mining model to expect client conduct using a typical electronic retail store for data combination and concentrate critical examples from the client conduct data. In this undertaking, a solo grouping of information on the customer's records from a regular food item company's data set will be played out. Customer segmentation is the act of clustering customers into bunches that reflect likenesses among customers in each group. Customers are separated into sections to advance the meaning of every customer to the business. To change items as indicated by unmistakable requirements and practices of the customers. It additionally assists the business with obliging the worries of various kinds of customers. Customers were clustered using a technique known as agglomerative clustering, which is a type of hierarchical clustering. Agglomerative clustering is a method for clustering data in a hierarchical order. It entails merging cases until you reach the appropriate n"

    "abstract": "Conventional nucleic acid methods often face challenges in achieving both high sensitivity and specificity for reliable detection of viral RNA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provides excellent sensitivity but fluorescence readouts often face ambiguity of detection at low template concentrations. Reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) integrated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) enables easy, cost effective, label-free detection and supports portable assays, however, non-specific impedance responses often reduce assay specificity. To overcome these limitations, we apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a post-processing strategy for heterogeneous biosensing signals. NMF decomposes data into physically interpretable latent components by enforcing non-negativity, making it well suited for effective amplification and detection analysis. Two datasets are analyzed: cycle-dependent fluorescence intensity from RT-PCR and frequency-dependent impedance magnitude from RT-LAMP EIS. NMF successfully discriminates amplification-specific contributions from residual noise, improving sensitivity in fluorescence data and specificity in electrochemical measurements. The resulting component scores enable robust classification of positive and negative samples achieving an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 86.7%, outperforming conventional both optical and electrochemical schemes. Using hepatitis C virus RNA as a representative case, we demonstrate that non-negative decomposition framework offers a generalizable strategy for improving the accuracy of molecular diagnostics across diverse biosensing platforms."

This technical advancement includes the fusion of cutting-edge digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D modeling, augmented and virtual reality-enabled wearable sensors, the consumer Internet of Things, and Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AAI). The metaverse has given rise to a variety of study paradigms in several domains. Its advancement increases the flexibility of virtual therapy, immersive health education and training, cognitive trials, and other session-related activities in the healthcare industry. This paper explores the effects of digital gaming therapy on the current state of health diagnosis and treatment within this investigation. After identifying these aspects, this paper proposes an innovative and secure architecture, called Meta-EGamofy, to overcome significant issues in cognitive healthcare. We offer a design solution for diagnosing phobias, conducting therapy, and providing treatment through the Sandbox platform by using an immersive game-based therapy method. Extending the definition of the digital twin in meta-EGamofy allows for system management, real-time monitoring, and cognitive health assessments, all while supporting the preservation of the consultant-patient relationship. We prioritize consortium-distributed network-enabled wearable sensor resource optimization in the development of this immersive healthcare solution. Therefore, autonomous artificial intelligence is crucial, especially when it comes to the use of artificial neural networks. In addition, meta-EGamofy may examine customized risk factors, such as vital signs, behaviors, and firsthand observations, supporting consultants in carrying out more thorough evaluations."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework, SA-DEM, for extrinsic non-grasping manipulation of ungraspable objects in robotics. This approach is grounded in dual-stage reinforcement learning and decouples the overall task into two sequential phases: interactive mode decision-making and manipulation action planning. Notably, this framework innovatively incorporates the stiffness information of manipulated objects into the decision-making process, enabling the robot to autonomously perceive, decide, and plan manipulation strategies for objects with diverse physical attributes. The first phase of SA-DEM involves a high-level agent responsible for planning the grasping pose of objects and their interaction locations with the environment, based on the initial state of the objects, observations from environmental point clouds, stiffness representations, and prior knowledge of grasping regions. The second phase is executed by a low-level agent, which focuses on planning specific manipulation actions such as poking and flipping. These actions are derived from autonomous exploration during the training process, negating the need for manual customization. Both agents employ a hybrid discrete-continuous action space along with time-abstracted and spatially grounded representations centered around the point cloud, culminating in a unified actor-critic reinforcement learning framework."

However, current methods usually combine all endmembers and abundances into a single matrix. However, this approach overlooks the distinct capacity differences of each substance subspace. Furthermore, traditional approaches typically reconstruct without accounting for corresponding errors, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that uses self-adjusted <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">individual logical feature (LIF)</i> subspaces for each substance. This enables the accurate modeling of each substance’s unique properties. Our method calculates the capacity of each subspace by unifying the features of each substance, thereby ensuring a more accurate representation. Importantly, our approach balances reconstruction fidelity and error, preventing blind approximation of the observed HSI and addressing overfitting. Additionally, our approach exploits correlations between reconstructed subspaces to minimize redundancy. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superior performance and validity of the proposed method."

Chaotic oscillators are widely utilized in secure communication and random number generation applications, where maintaining robust chaotic behavior is crucial. Traditionally, adjusting the dynamics of analog chaotic oscillators requires modifying hardware components, making transitions between different operating modes complex and impractical. Furthermore, long-term component degradation and variations in nominal values can lead to an unintended transition from chaos to periodicity, compromising system security and performance. In this study, we demonstrate that bias voltage tuning provides a flexible and effective means to control and stabilize the chaotic dynamics of the Colpitts oscillator. The findings establish bias voltage control as a practical and reliable solution for sustaining chaos, ensuring long-term stability and adaptability of chaotic behavior. This method enhances chaotic oscillators’ reliability and practical applicability in security and signal processing applications, reducing dependency on hardware modifications."

The initial plasma is generated in the trigger gap of FTVS and is greatly influenced by the structure of the trigger electrode. In this paper, the conduction delay characteristics of FTVS under different types of trigger electrode, embedding depths, and lengths of the trigger gap were studied by using detachable vacuum chambers. The experimental results show that among the three types of trigger electrode, the FTVS with the flat-type trigger electrode has the best conduction delay characteristics. When the embedding depth of the trigger gap is within 1 mm, it shows relatively excellent conduction delay characteristics. Under the same working conditions, the conduction delay of FTVS with a trigger gap distance of 0.75 mm is approximately similar to that of FTVS with a trigger gap distance of 0.5 mm. It should be noted that when changing the structure of the trigger electrode, the performance requirements of the FTVS trigger circuit and the changes in the trigger threshold after multiple operations should be taken into account."

A main challenge in IoT network is the Controller Placement Problem (CPP), which is essential for minimize latency, balance load, ensure reliability, and optimize energy consumption. This paper reviews 10 algorithms and approaches that have been proposed to solve CPP. To solve the CPP, algorithms minimize latency, improve fault tolerance, balance load, enhance energy efficiency, and ensure scalability. Various algorithms have been proposed to tackle these challenges, each algorithm has unique advantages.

It achieved up to 20.25% performance improvement as compared to PSO in Deutsche topology. For energy efficiency, the Fitness Averaged-Rider Optimization Algorithm (FA-ROA) improves cluster head selection in WSN-IoT networks. It achieved up to 50% better energy efficiency as compared to other algorithms. Other approaches such as GWOAP, Louvain Algorithm with Betweenness-Centrality, CPCSA and Tabu Search Algorithm have also been analyzed for CPP. This review paper provides a detailed analysis of these approaches and algorithms in addressing the complexities of controller placement in IoT networks.

    "abstract": "As a method for configuring firewalls, systems that combine Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) have attracted attention. However, in such systems, since the IDS is responsible only for attack detection and the blocking function is separated and handled by the SDN switch, there is a delay before malicious traffic is actually blocked. This delay consists of the time required for the IDS to detect the attack and to notify the SDN switch, allowing attacks to pass through during this period. This problem can be addressed by replacing the IDS with an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), which integrates both attack detection and blocking. However, this change leads to a degradation in system performance due to the waiting time for traffic inspection by the IPS. In this research, we introduce two acceleration methods into the system to mitigate the performance degradation caused by replacing IDS with IPS: Benign Flow Bypass and DoS Blocking Offload. As a result of the evaluation, we confirmed the effectiveness of each proposed method. Furthermore, by combining the benign flow bypass and the DoS blocking offload, the system achieved 1.81 times higher performance under DoS attacks compared to the case without any acceleration methods."

Experimental results indicate that the probability of anode-initiated surface flashover may be related to the electric field intensity and surface charge accumulation near the anode and cathode. This provides experimental support for further study of surface flashover mechanism, and has reference significance for improving the performance of electronic devices."

To address the challenges of particle charging and agglomeration during surface modification, this paper proposes a method for modifying the surfaces of alumina particles using pulsed hollow cathode discharge. A reciprocating particle vibration circulation device was designed, where external vibration was applied to disperse the particles and prevent agglomeration. By enabling the alumina particles to fall uniformly and repeatedly traverse the plasma zone, uniform surface modification of the particles was achieved. This method enables efficient surface modification of alumina particles, with a DLC growth rate exceeding $34 \\mathrm{~nm} / \\mathrm{h}$. By selecting an appropriate pulse voltage amplitude, DLC coatings with $\\mathbf{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ carbon atoms content exceeding $60 \\%$ can be deposited. This lays the foundation for the development of fillers for high-thermal-conductivity epoxy composites."

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel framework—M2VTT-Rec (Multimodal Model-driven Virtual Try-on Recommendation)—which aims to transform personalized recommendations in online retail. The M2VTT-Rec framework deeply incorporates users' multimodal interactions during virtual try-on sessions—including real-time imagery, biometric signals, facial expressions, and voice cues—alongside multimodal product knowledge, such as 3D product models and design semantics.The system features a cutting-edge module for sensing and encoding try-on data across modalities, coupled with a fine-grained preference alignment network and a bidirectional reinforcement learning mechanism that captures user visual inclinations and evolving interests. Furthermore, a context-sensitive recommendation generator is designed to produce rich multimodal outfit suggestions and interpretable narrative explanations.Empirical evaluation using a purpose-built multimodal virtual try-on dataset shows that M2VTT-Rec achieves superior performance over the baseline ALS model on key metrics like Recall@10 and NDCG@10, with especially strong results in various cold start scenarios. Additionally, it markedly improves the average session duration and boosts user engagement and satisfaction across user segments with different purchasing habits. Ablation studies further validate the essential roles of multimodal implicit feedback representation and reinforcement learning in achieving these outcomes. Overall, this research presents a forward-looking approach for applying multimodal large models in vertical domains such as e-commerce, paving the way for more intelligent, interactive recommendation systems."

Our results show that including volatility and overnight trading effects significantly improves model prediction, especially when firm-specific volatility is used. Interaction terms between volatility and overnight returns occasionally achieve significance, suggesting nonlinear dynamics in return generation. While the linear models capture substantial predictive patterns at the monthly level, the use of machine learning methods does not consistently outperform them, likely due to limited sample size."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (IPMSMs) have been widely adopted in household appliances, railway systems, and automobiles. In high power applications of PMSMs, the carrier frequency of the inverter is often intentionally lowered to minimize switching losses. However, lowering the carrier frequency increases the control cycle period, which degrades the responsiveness and stability of current control, sensorless control, etc. The high-frequency square-wave-type voltage injection method is a sensorless control that estimates the rotor position by utilizing the magnetic saliency of IPMSMs, and it is effective in standstill and low-speed operation. This method allows the injection voltage frequency to reach up to the carrier frequency, enabling efficient extraction of high-frequency components even under low carrier frequency operation. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has attracted attention for its high responsiveness, and prior research has explored its application in current control, speed control, and back-EMF based sensorless control for PMSMs. In this paper, we propose a sensorless control method for standstill and low-speed operation under intentionally low carrier frequency, by applying MPC to the high-frequency square-wave-type voltage injection method. The proposed method is evaluated in comparison with conventional PI-based control. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher responsiveness than conventional PI control both at standstill and low-speed and under low carrier frequency conditions."

    "abstract": "Collaboratively deployed across thousands of networked clients, federated learning (FL) is influenced by the degradation of statistical heterogeneity and noise from mobile devices. Although existing FL approaches adopt optimization solutions for improving reliability, the reliability of the model is difficult to guarantee. As the assessment of reliability lacks the exploration of local data, effectively gauging model performance based solely on inherent data characteristics is challenging. Therefore, we propose an uncertainty-aware federated prior learning (FedPL) to increase the reliability of the global model by mitigating the prediction uncertainty. FedPL constructs a client selection based on the uncertainty of the categorical prior in each client where data uncertainty can be perceived in the server. Furthermore, FedPL rectifies the local uncertainty quantification (UQ) to increase the consistency between the global server and volatile clients. By aligning local models with the global uncertainty level, FedPL fosters a more effective generalization of the local models towards the global objective. In the comparison of the status quo, our experiments demonstrate that FedPL effectively enhances the reliability of the global model in terms of reliability indicators. Furthermore, FedPL demonstrates resilience to noise, delivering reliable predictions that outperform other state-of-the-arts (SOTA) algorithms."

    "abstract": "Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) often require computing travel times between tens of thousands of geographic locations to plan routes for hundreds of vehicles. For example, during the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in Korea, hundreds of vehicles were tasked with delivering vaccines to thousands of destinations each week. Solving such VRPs necessitates estimating pairwise travel times between origin-destination (OD) pairs, a process that scales quadratically with the number of destinations. Existing travel time estimation methods typically focus on individual routes and rely on rich contextual data such as GPS trajectories, road types, traffic volume, and weather conditions. While accurate, these methods are computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale VRPs due to their input requirements and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient and scalable deep learning-based travel time estimation approach designed for datasets with limited features. Our model uses only geocoordinates and departure times as inputs, and enhances predictive accuracy by incorporating derived nonlinear spatial features specifically, geodesic and Manhattan-style distances.We also investigate the effect of other derived input features, such as second-order polynomials of the basic inputs, to assess whether they contribute to performance improvement. This lightweight input representation enables rapid <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) inference, making it suitable for VRP-scale scenarios. We also investigate the effects of architectural choices, including batch normalization, loss function variants, and input normalization, on model performance. When geodesic distance is added as an input feature, the validation loss (MSE) drops to about 14 % of the value obtained with coordinates alone, and the cumulative probability of achieving a relative error of at most 0.2 rises from 25 % to more than 50 %. These quantitative gains demonstrate high predictive accuracy and strong generalization to unseen OD pairs, suggesting that the proposed framework is a practical and effective solution for large-scale, real-world VRP applications."

    "abstract": "The development of the internet has greatly facilitated the transmission of images over social networks, while also triggering serious copyright issues. Deep robust watermarking serves as a crucial technique for image copyright protection. However, the image distortions caused by Social Network Transmission Operations (SNTOs) make existing deep robust watermarking methods fragile in real-world social network scenarios. To address this, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Deep Robust Watermarking method, called CL-DRW, to generate watermarks that can be resilient to SNTOs. Specifically, we develop a watermarking model constructed with an invertible neural network and present a multi-stage training framework based on curriculum learning to train it effectively. We incrementally introduce noise attacks based on their disruptive impact on the watermark, from weak to strong, thereby enabling our model to build robustness against SNTOs gradually. Additionally, we design an SNTOs simulation noise layer, which is built upon a transformer-based deep network and incorporates differentiable JPEG, to simulate the black-box distortions caused by SNTOs. Extensive experiments indicate that our proposed CL-DRW outperforms state-of-the-art deep watermarking methods in terms of robustness against real-world social network transmission operations.

However, LAE suffers from the security problems due to the high probability of line-of-sight (LoS) channel. Compared with other security technologies, covert communication technology can achieve higher security by hiding the information transmission behavior. Therefore, in this article, we investigate the covert communication in LAE. First, we introduce the relevant applications and corresponding advantages in detail, and briefly introduce covert communication in LAE networks. Then, we discuss the approaches to realize covert communication in LAE. Furthermore, a case study is proposed to improve the covertness of a novel bidirectional communication scenario in LAE networks, which maximizes the weighted covert rate by jointly optimizing the user association, aircraft trajectory, and transmit power of users and aircraft. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms benchmarks. Finally, some challenges and future directions are discussed."

    "abstract": "Energy predictive models employing performance events have emerged as a promising alternative to other mainstream methods for developing software power meters used in runtime energy profiling of applications. These models are cost-effective and provide a highly accurate means of measuring the energy consumption of applications during execution. Recently, software power meters have been proposed to profile the dynamic energy consumption of data transfers between CPU and GPU in heterogeneous hybrid platforms, thereby effectively addressing the gap between software power meters that measure computations and those that measure data transfers. However, the state-of-the-art software power meters lack fundamental properties essential for achieving accurate runtime energy profiling of parallel hybrid programs on heterogeneous hybrid servers. Two critical properties are <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">concurrency</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">orthogonality</i>. In this work, we define these essential properties and propose a methodology for developing concurrent and orthogonal platform-level software power meters capable of accurate runtime energy profiling of parallel hybrid programs on heterogeneous hybrid servers. We apply this methodology to develop software power meters for three heterogeneous hybrid servers that consist of Intel multicore CPUs and Nvidia GPUs from different generations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed software power meters by using them to estimate the dynamic energy consumption of computation and communication activities in three parallel hybrid programs. Our results show that the average prediction error for dynamic energy consumption by these software power meters is just 2.5% across our servers."

Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) with its high-density sampling in space, centimeter-level accuracy in elevation, and repeated reference ground track (RGT) mechanism, enables high-precision terrain parameter calculation. In this study, we propose a method for estimating terrain slope and aspect by integrating multi-input information of the along-track, cross-track, and pulse width information. A spatial proximity-based weighting algorithm is employed to optimize the integration. Validations with local digital elevation models (DEMs) are conducted in four mountainous regions across North America. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved the best RMSEs in slope (3.8°) and aspect (10.9°) estimations compared with current approaches. Overall, our method confirms the effectiveness and robustness of integrating multi-input information, providing a reliable methodological basis for high-precision terrain parameter retrieval in future applications of multi-beam photon-counting lidars."

Conventional energy transmission technologies relying on unidirectional flow and single input-output port configurations no longer fulfill the requirements of applications such as electric-assisted vehicles, energy storage devices, and renewable energy sources. High flexibility in energy transmission and extended port connectivity have become essential characteristics for advanced conversion technologies. To address the key technical challenges in energy conversion, a co-construct conversion circuit is introduced using integrated circuit design methodologies to enhance port scalability. In addition, the circuit adopts a flexible control strategy through power transistors, enabling bidirectional energy transmission and accommodating varying input voltages across expanded input ports, thereby improving the adaptability of energy storage applications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed circuit, a prototype has been constructed and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results verify that the proposed circuit significantly enhances the flexibility of energy transmission and the expandability of port connections, while further improving the adaptability and reliability of integrated applications."

However, their applicability is not uniform – particularly when the target language is under-resourced or when computational resources are constrained. In this study, we systematically assess the feasibility of building novel TTS models using four widely adopted open-source architectures: FastPitch, VITS, Grad-TTS, and Matcha-TTS. Our evaluation spans multiple dimensions, including qualitative aspects such as ease of installation, dataset preparation, and hardware requirements, as well as quantitative assessments of synthesis quality for Romanian. We employ both objective metrics and subjective listening tests to evaluate intelligibility, speaker similarity, and naturalness of the generated speech. The results reveal significant challenges in tool chain setup, data preprocessing, and computational efficiency, which can hinder adoption in low-resource contexts. By grounding the analysis in reproducible protocols and accessible evaluation criteria, thiswork aims to inform best practices and promote more inclusive, language-diverse TTS development. All information needed to reproduce this study (i.e. code and data) will be made available after the final review."

Through a series of experiments involving language and domain adaptation, we evaluate the performance gains from leveraging pretrained models versus training from scratch. Our findings demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves model performance, especially in scenarios with limited Arabic training data. Word Error Rate (WER) comparisons reveal that models initialized with English pretrained weights yield better generalization and lower WERs compared to both scratch-trained and French-initialized models, highlighting the importance of source language selection in cross-lingual ASR.

    "abstract": "Due to the existence of stray capacitance, the voltage unevenness within the ceramic envelopes of the vacuum interrupter becomes increasingly serious with the increase of voltage levels, enhancing the risk of dielectric breakdown. Therefore, the voltage-sharing issue has become a difficult problem that hinders the development of vacuum circuit breakers towards higher voltage levels. At present, the adoption of voltage self-sharing ceramic envelope made of a highpermittivity ceramic instead of the low-permittivity alumina has become a promising solution by virtue of its self-sharing voltage, even electric field and compact structure. However, there is lacking of targeted development on the material parameters of the high-permittivity ceramic such as permittivity, breakdown strength, and temperature characteristics, restraining the achievement of an optimized voltage-sharing performance. As a prerequisite, proposal of the ceramic material parameters is carried out based on physical field simulation, taking a 252 kV vacuum interrupter for example. Via electric field simulation, for the ceramic with permittivity no less than 1000, the standard deviation of voltage difference for the ceramic envelopes decreases by $\\mathbf{5} \\sim \\mathbf{6}$ times compared to alumina. The maximum electric field within the ceramic envelope is $15 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{cm}$. Considering a $\\mathbf{1 0}$-fold margin of the working electric field, the breakdown strength of the ceramic needs to reach more than $150 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{cm}$. Further, by introducing ceramic loss, the electrothermal field simulation is applied to resolve the temperature characteristics on voltage sharing. The ceramic should meet the X7T class or higher, and the dielectric loss should not exceed 0.02. This work provides a data basis for the targeted development of materials for the voltage self-sharing ceramic envelope."

In this work, we utilize the Qin-1 facility $(370 \\mathrm{kA} / 235 \\mathrm{~ns})$ equipped with an independently adjustable prepulse current on aluminum wire array $\\mathbf{Z}$-pinches. We observed a novel transition in the dynamic behavior of aluminum wire arrays from ablation implosion to snow-plow implosion, a phenomenon not seen when only the main pulse current is applied. Specifically, when the interval between the prepulse and main pulse current is less than a critical threshold, the regulated wire array exhibits both external snow-plow implosion and interval ablation implosion, showcasing mixed implosion characteristics. As the interval increases beyond this critical threshold, the Z-pinch process transitions to a pure snow-plow implosion devoid of wire core ablation, with the radiual filled with plasma. The insights gained are instrumental for the design of prepulse current sources and load configurations in megampere(MA) high-current facilities."

This study explores what influences their job choices at different levels of education. We used a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to collect data from 391 nursing students. They were asked to choose between job options that varied by six features: salary, staffing numbers, work environment, work pressure, team atmosphere, and commute time. To study the results, we used a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model. This helped us find patterns and see which job features matter most. We found that salary is the top priority for students. But other factors like team atmosphere, work environment, and pressure also play important roles. One key finding is that a high salary becomes even more appealing when the work atmosphere is friendly. These two factors together make a job much more attractive. By combining machine learning with DCE, we were able to better understand how students’ preferences differ. This approach can help shape smarter hiring and support plans in community nursing."

    "abstract": "With the development of 6G space-air-ground-sea integrated networks, UAV-assisted data collection technology in wireless sensor networks (WSN) has become critical for ensuring information timeliness due to its high mobility and flexible coverage capabilities. However, the trade-off between UAV energy consumption and data collection timeliness becomes increasingly prominent in large-scale WSNs. This paper focuses on the Age of Information (AoI) as a core metric to address the collaborative optimization problem in UAV-assisted data collection. The proposed approach aims to jointly optimize UAV flight trajectories, cruising velocities, and sensor transmission power to minimize the IoT monitoring system's weighted average AoI (WAoI) under total energy supply constraints. We propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based algorithm and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm demonstrates the best energy efficiency and stability, achieving approximately 49.8% greater reduction in optimized WAoI compared to a GA-based algorithm."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed edge devices without sharing raw data, but the large number of devices and frequent parameter exchanges create substantial communication overhead. To improve communication efficiency, event-triggered mechanisms have been introduced. However, such approaches may exclude valuable but inactive users (i.e., IoT devices with informative data but limited activity) or overlook subtle but important updates, resulting in suboptimal trade-offs between communication efficiency and training performance. To address this, we propose Stochastic Event-Triggered Lazy Aggregation with Stochastic Quantization (SET-LASQ). SET-LASQ employs a probabilistic triggering strategy that adaptively balances the participation of highly contributing users with the reactivation of long-inactive ones, while incorporating gradient quantization to further reduce transmitted bits. Under strong convexity, we theoretically prove that SET-LASQ achieves sublinear convergence with a diminishing stepsize and linear convergence to a steady-state neighborhood with a fixed stepsize. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify that SET-LASQ reduces both communication rounds and transmission volume while maintaining competitive model accuracy, consistently outperforming deterministic event-triggered and lazy aggregation baselines under independent and non-independent data distributions."

    "abstract": "Grid-edge devices are becoming increasingly important in the energy transition. Preserving privacy was not previously considered an important aspect for power grid operations, but with the increased proliferation of customer-owned assets, it is now an essential consideration. Several mechanisms have been proposed to provide privacy for non-utility owned assets in the power grid. Federated learning (FL) is one method gaining prominence in this area. Although FL has been used for other applications, such as auto-complete in phones, there has not been much investigation into whether these approaches are feasible for grid applications. In this work, we use a research platform with real-time simulators and hardware-in-the-loop capabilities to investigate how FL can be applied to grid-edge devices, and we present the potential grid services that can be derived for these devices. We discuss the computational challenges with deploying complex FL approaches, and we explore several grid services, including participation in retail electricity markets, voltage control, and resilience-driven reconfiguration."

    "abstract": "Autonomous personal mobility vehicle (APMV) is an innovative small autonomous transportation device designed for individual use in mixed-traffic environments, such as shared spaces and indoor environments. To enhance the interaction experience between pedestrians and APMVs and to prevent potential risks, it is crucial to investigate pedestrians’ walking behaviors when interacting with APMVs and to understand the psychological processes underlying these behaviors. This study aims to investigate the causal relations between subjective evaluations of pedestrians and their walking behaviors during interactions with an APMV equipped with an external human-machine interface (eHMI). An experiment of pedestrian-APMV interaction was conducted with 42 pedestrian participants, in which various eHMIs on the APMV were designed to induce participants to experience different levels of subjective evaluations and generate the corresponding walking behaviors. Based on the hypothesized model of the pedestrian’s cognition-decision-behavior process, the results of causal discovery align with the previously proposed model. Furthermore, this study further analyzes the direct and total causal effects of each factor and investigates the causal processes affecting several important factors in the field of human-vehicle interaction, such as situation awareness, trust in vehicle, risk perception, hesitation in decision making, and walking behaviors."

    "abstract": "Bicycle transportation, a low-carbon option, is essential for promoting sustainable urban mobility. However, predicting bicycle traffic is challenging due to limited investments in data collection, especially in smaller cities. This paper proposes a multi-source transfer learning spatial-temporal graph neural network (Multi-TLSTGCN) for accurate bicycle traffic prediction in target cities with limited available data. This study first examines how to transfer knowledge from single source domain to the target domain while mitigating the risk of negative transfer. Following this, a multi-source adaptive transfer learning approach is developed to optimize traffic prediction in the target domain by adaptively integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Finally, the performance of the Multi-TLSTGCN model is evaluated under various levels of target data scarcity and compared with models that do not incorporate source domain knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate several key insights: 1) Models fine-tuned with a single-cluster pre-trained source model where the clusters are formed based on similar traffic patterns are more effective at minimizing negative knowledge transfer than those fine-tuned with single-city pre-trained source models. 2) The proposed Multi-TLSTGCN outperforms baseline models in bicycle traffic prediction, showing promise for accurate predictions in data-scarce environments; and 3) The Multi-TLSTGCN model remains robust across varying levels of data scarcity, exhibiting only a slight decrease in accuracy as the availability of target data decreases, in contrast to models relying solely on target domain data. These findings highlight the Multi-TLSTGCN model as an effective and promising solution for bicycle traffic prediction with limited data availability."

    "abstract": "We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infant behavior in the “mobile paradigm”. This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant’s crib) is connected to one of the infant’s limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that “connected” limb. This ability to detect a “sensorimotor contingency” is considered to be a oundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, shedding light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infant sensorimotor learning.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

    "abstract": "Motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has been widely used to promote stroke rehabilitation. However, the conventional lower limb MI paradigm can only induce weak brain activation in stroke patients and cannot effectively guide patients to generate pronounced features during MI tasks, limiting the widespread application of MI-BCI. In this study, we applied a novel walking MI paradigm based on gait phase encoding sequential sensory threshold electrical stimulation (SES-MI) in stroke patients, and systematically explored the efficacy of SES-MI in enhancing brain response patterns and improving classification accuracy, compared with the MI paradigm only with text cues (Non-MI) and with invariable electrical stimulation (IES-MI). Thirteen stroke patients were recruited for this experiment. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) was utilized to supply details about the event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomenon. Brain activation region, intensity and functional connectivity were compared among the three paradigms. SES-MI induced stronger and wider-area ERD activation than Non-MI and IES-MI. In the somatosensory cortex, the ERD amplitudes of SES-MI increased by a maximum of 115% in contrast to Non-MI. The enhancement of activation in bilateral sensorimotor cortex and prefrontal cortex was observed in SES-MI. The increased brain excitability only occurred in the alpha frequency band. Compared with Non-MI, decreased functional connectivity between different brain regions was found in SES-MI and IES-MI, especially in SES-MI. In the alpha+beta bands, the 2-class classification accuracy for SES-MI vs. SES-Idle (81.30%) was significantly improved compared with the other two paradigms. This work demonstrates that SES-MI is a more efficient paradigm for the modulation of the brain activation patterns, having the potential to promote the development of MI-BCI in stroke lower limb rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a switched model predictive control (MPC) approach for switched systems subject to state/input constraints and switching constraints. The switching constraints, including dwell-time restrictions and path constraints, complicate the design of the control law and the switching law. To ensure constraint satisfaction, a switch-admissible control invariant (switch-ACI) set is constructed by incorporating dwell-time restrictions and admissible path constraints. Based on switch-ACI sets, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the construction of the initial feasible region that ensures the existence of a control law and a switching law satisfying all system constraints. To mitigate the inherent computational complexity of mixed-integer programming (MIP), artificial final points are introduced to develop a computationally efficient switched MPC algorithm, in which the MIP problem is transformed into several standard quadratic programming problems. The persistent feasibility and closed-loop stability of the developed switched MPC are ensured, and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a vehicle lane-changing case study."

To facilitate DER participation in the IPFR market, this paper proposes an aggregation model and market mechanism for VPPs participating in IPFR. First, an energy-reserve-IPFR market framework is developed, in which a VPP acts as an intermediary to coordinate heterogeneous DERs. Second, by taking into account the delay associated with inertial response, an optimization-based VPP aggregation method is introduced to encapsulate the IPFR process involving a variety of DERs. Third, an energy-reserve-IPFR market mechanism with VPP participation is introduced, aiming to minimize social costs, where stochastic deviations of renewable energy generation are explicitly modeled through chance-constrained reformulations, ensuring that the cleared energy, reserve, and IPFR schedules remain secure against forecast errors. Case studies on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show that the nadir and quasi-steady-state frequencies are reproduced by the VPP aggregation model with a mean absolute percentage error ≤ 0.03%, and the proposed market mechanism with VPP participation reduces the total system cost by approximately 40% and increases the net profit by about 30%."

    "abstract": "Graph pooling is crucial for enlarging the receptive field and reducing computational costs in deep graph representation learning. In this work, we propose a simple but effective graph probabilistic pooling (GP-Pool) framework to facilitate graph feature learning. Instead of either deterministic selection or random dropping, we design a probabilistic subgraph sampling to reach an expected distribution by deducing a variational bound. Accordingly, a Bernoulli graph pooling (BernPool) is first derived to sample nodes together with the local structures, for which a learnable reference set is introduced to encode nodes into a latent expressive probability space. Hereby, the resultant BernPool captures salient graph substructures while possessing much diversity on sampled nodes due to its nondeterministic manner. For more controllable pooling, we derive the Poisson-distributed version (aka PoissonPool) from BernPool to explicitly cut the node quantity with less variables in variational learning. Furthermore, considering the complementarity of node sampling and clustering, we propose a hybrid graph pooling (HGP) paradigm to combine a compact subgraph (via BernPool/PoissonPool) and a coarsening graph (via clustering), to retain both representative substructures and global topology. Extensive experiments on multiple public graph classification datasets demonstrate that our GP-Pool is superior to various graph pooling methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance."

The proposed model overcomes the problems, which helps in the increase of efficiency in crop irrigation. This leads to a reduction in energy of Labor and water consumption.

We detect the disease that in plants by using MATLAB analysis. By using this system there will be increase in food production and helps farmers to visit the farm less frequently and to focus on the other activities or even maintain several farms with a variety of crops.

    "abstract": "Solid Insulated Switchgear (SIS) is smaller than other switchgear, because of its use of epoxy resin with high insulation performance. The molded vacuum interrupter for the switchgear is also smaller but has higher electric field intensity, which is likely to cause partial discharge in vacuum. This is attributable to by emitting primary electrons and secondary electrons, and it is necessary to suppress these electrons in order to reduce the occurrence of partial discharge. Primary electrons were emitted from high electric field points on metal surface, and so we must remove these points to suppress partial discharge occurrence. We focused on a way of suppressing primary electrons emission, namely, electron beam irradiation process on metal surface. It is considered that the electron beam irradiation melts and removes the high electric field points caused partial discharge in vacuum. In this article, we investigated the effects on partial discharge in vacuum of electron beam process on metal surface. As a result, it was confirmed that partial discharge extinction voltage with electron beam improved, and the longer the beam irradiation time is, the higher the voltage is."

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for power supply continuity in industrial power systems, dual power transfer switches are widely used in $\\mathbf{6 k V}$ industrial distribution systems. However, they commonly face problems such as the rapid decay of bus residual voltage and excessively large inrush currents during the switching process, resulting in a switching failure rate as high as $18 \\%$. This paper constructs a transient simulation model of $\\mathbf{6 k V}$ dual-power switching based on ETAP software, with induction motors as the core load. Two typical operating conditions (motor capacities ranging from 20-35 MW, phase angle differences from 0° to 180°) are set to quantitatively analyze the correlation mechanism between the transient drop rate of the bus residual voltage and the inrush current. A “dynamic phase angle-time coordinated control strategy” is proposed. By real-time monitoring of the characteristics of the bus residual voltage, for induction motors with a capacity of 18$\\mathbf{2 5 ~ M W}$, a fast-switching strategy is preferably adopted; for induction motors with a capacity of $\\mathbf{2 5 - 3 0 ~ M W}$, a synchronization- capture control strategy is used."

The model includes hydrodynamic equations and heat transfer equations. The energy flux density, current density and pressure are taken as input parameters. The simulation parameters used in this model are derived from experiments and other research work. The initial position of the multiplication spots is randomly generated. The simulation results show that after the formation of a single spot, the metal droplets are completely formed and splashed evenly on the surface of the electrode, laying the foundation for the generation of new spots. The proliferation process of new spots will squeeze each other with the initial spots, forming multiple liquid metal ridges. The width and depth of new spots are related to the center temperature of the craters when they are produced, and they continue to expand under continuous energy flow injection, resulting in more complicated and serious ablation of the surface of planar electrodes. The simulation results are compared with those of other metals, and the position of new spots is controlled in the simulation. The simulation results show that the ablation on tungsten-copper alloy is less than that on pure copper metal cathode, but greater than that on pure tungsten metal cathode."

As the voltage level increases, the problem of nonuniformity of voltage distribution becomes particularly severe. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the voltage distribution characteristics of multi-break vacuum environmental circuit breakers. This paper establishes three-dimensional models of $\\mathbf{5 5 0 k V}$ double-break vacuum circuit breaker with different structures, calculates the distributed capacitance. Further simulation analysis of voltage distribution under lightning impulse voltage for double-break vacuum circuit breakers with different structures revealed that, without voltage-sharing capacitors, the voltage distribution in the T-type structure was more uniform than that in the U-type structure, and the voltage amplitude on the porcelain shell was smaller. Finally, the voltage distribution characteristics of the circuit breaker under parallel voltage-sharing capacitor configuration were simulated, along with an analysis of capacitor value design. The results indicate that parallel voltage-sharing capacitors can improve the uniformity of voltage distribution across the breakers and reduce the maximum voltage amplitude on each porcelain shell. Based on the voltage distribution characteristics with different capacitor values, it is recommended that the voltage-sharing capacitor value for the 550 kV double-break vacuum circuit breaker be set to $\\mathbf{7 0 0} \\mathbf{p F}$, a conservative design could be set at 1700 pF."

The proposed circuit delivers a stable 0.8 V output reference voltage with minimal sensitivity to variations in process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT), making it well-suited for integration in low-voltage power management systems such as DC-DC converters. The design incorporates a curvature-compensated architecture and a fully integrated two-stage operational amplifier with startup and bias circuitry to ensure robust operation across a wide temperature range from –40 °C to +125 °C. The complete BGR occupies an active area of 0.04327 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and consumes a maximum of 36.17 µA at 5 V supply in the worst-case corner. Simulations demonstrate a temperature coefficient of 65 ppm/°C and line regulation of 1.17 mV/V (0.145 %/V), with DC PSRR of −47 dB at low frequencies. While not optimized for ultra-low power or ultrahigh accuracy, the design achieves a favorable balance of performance, layout efficiency, and a wide input voltage range, making it a practical choice for certain mixed-signal and power management applications in 180 nm BCD technologies."

However, existing intelligent medical care assistants are mainly oriented to the medical professional community, and patients with non-medical backgrounds face many challenges when using AI-assisted self-diagnosis. In this paper, a knowledge graph is introduced to enhance the assisted diagnosis capability of multimodal macrolanguage modeling for geriatric ophthalmic diseases. The approach generates final conclusions by systematically decomposing complex problems into sub-problems, reasoning using the Multimodal Large Model (MLLM), and combining inference graphs and implicit knowledge. In the ncbi/Hidden-flaws-GPT-4V benchmark test, this method outperforms the existing models in terms of inference depth and accuracy: the accuracy is improved by 3.37% compared to MM-CoT-Base and 0.94% compared to DDCoT. Experiments show that the multimodal knowledge graph-driven approach proposed in this study exhibits superior reasoning performance and interpretability in both medical Q&amp;A and ocular disease diagnosis tasks. It can integrate patients' multimodal medical care data to provide accurate and personalized care recommendations and predictions for localized contexts."

Our goal is to maximize the sum-rate of all MUs by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, power allocation, and passive transmission and reflection (T&R) beamforming of the STAR-RIS.

Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated strong potential for fast, accurate, and automated seismic segmentation. However, DL-based methods typically require a large amount of labeled training data, which often lacks physical interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid automatic seismic facies classification approach that combines the wavelet scattering transform (WST) with DL, named WSTSFNet. The WST, a time-frequency (TF) method, can be viewed as a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that employs fixed wavelets as filters, enhancing the model’s feature representation, robustness, and generalization capabilities. Additionally, we adopt a modified U-Net as the backbone to establish a nonlinear mapping between three-dimensional (3D) seismic data and facies. To further improve segmentation accuracy, we integrate a holistically nested module in the proposed model. Finally, the proposed WSTSFNet is applied to the Netherlands F3 Block data for performance evaluation. The field data results reveal that the proposed WSTSFNet performs better compared to the comparison networks."

Local differential privacy (LDP) has been widely adopted in decentralized graph analysis to ensure privacy for individual nodes. However, existing LDP-based methods often fail to accommodate personalized privacy requirements due to their uniform encoding and equal perturbation mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose PEGS, a novel privacy-preserving decentralized graph synthesis approach that significantly improves utility while respecting user-specific privacy preferences. Specifically, we introduce interactive local differential privacy (iLDP), a new edge-level definition of LDP that relaxes the constraints of node-independent perturbation, thereby enabling the fulfillment of individual privacy needs. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized graph perturbation framework offering three levels of privacy settings. To optimize the balance between information preservation and privacy, we design encoding and perturbation mechanisms leveraging information entropy tailored to different privacy levels. Extensive experimental evaluations and rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrate that our method produces high-quality synthetic graphs while adhering to iLDP guarantees."

This paper proposes a variable amplitude pulsating signal injection method with low DC-bus voltage occupancy for sensorless control of IPMSMs. The varying injection amplitude is dynamically determined by both the fundamental three-phase voltage and the DC-bus voltage. A demodulation system is designed to extract the amplitudes of the response current. The sinusoidal-varying instantaneous susceptance signal, which is the amplitude ratio of the response current to the injection voltage, is introduced to obtain the rotor position. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and experiments. The proposed method significantly reduces the voltage occupancy of the injection signal to merely 5% of the DC-bus voltage, which extends the operational speed range of signal injection methods."

This approach enables low-frequency sinusoidal current generation without high-frequency PWM chopping, significantly reducing EMI and switching stress on power devices. A restructured 3-phase 6-terminal BLDC winding enables independent current injection into each phase, facilitating the realization of stable and low-distortion sinusoidal excitation. Hardware experiments validate the feasibility of the architecture, achieving stable motor operation at 2286 rpm with smooth current waveforms at the LC resonance frequency of 266 Hz. Beyond BLDC applications, the demonstrated ability to generate intrinsic low-frequency resonance without high-frequency excitation may provide a novel foundation for applications such as wearable or implantable biomedical power transfer, underwater wireless communication, brain–computer interface systems, etc."

    "abstract": "Deep Metric Learning (DML) is critical for constructing feature spaces where similar samples cluster closely, yet conventional cross-entropy (CE)–based methods often struggle to generalize to novel, unseen classes. The primary challenge arises from train–test scale misalignment, which disproportionately affects ambiguous (low-confidence) samples at test time and reduces separability. This paper presents a robust CE-based DML framework specifically designed to enhance generalization for unseen categories. We introduce Embedding Space Augmentation (ESA), a plug-in training component that (i) deliberately lowers the confidence of hard samples to amplify corrective gradients and (ii) guides updates along each class’s principal eigen-direction, thereby reducing intra-class variance and restoring train–test norm alignment. We quantify alignment with scale-invariant diagnostics—the Relative Radius Ratio and mean-radius gaps—and observe that ESA maintains small gaps throughout training, whereas CE drifts over time. Comprehensive experiments on standard image retrieval benchmarks, including CUB200, CARS196, SOP, and In-Shop, validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our method addresses the generalization gap, achieving superior retrieval performance and consistently yielding substantial Recall@1 gains over multiple baseline networks. The technique is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CE-based DML methods, offering significant and consistent accuracy improvements."

To address the limitations of existing RF-based technologies in bandwidth and latency, this paper investigates the SparkLink protocol and presents a novel wireless sensing framework. First, we employ frequency-hopping and multi-channel splicing to construct a wideband channel for improved channel parameters estimation. To address synchronization-induced phase errors, a bidirectional communication approach is introduced to effectively calibrate and eliminate inter-channel phase offsets. Building upon the spliced multi-channel, atomic norm minimization is applied for high-precision time-of-flight estimation. Furthermore, we develop a receiver architecture based on a single radio frequency chain integrated with a four-element uniform planar array, leveraging a tailored time-switching strategy to sequentially acquire spatial measurements. By incorporating the iterative adaptive approach, the system enables high-resolution two-dimensional direction-of-arrival estimation within the constraints of compact hardware, thereby supporting precise spatial sensing in complex indoor environments. Experimental evaluations in a real-world underground parking facility demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a median localization accuracy of 1.13 m for stationary targets and 1.32 m for dynamic tracking, delivering performance on par with state-of-the-art wireless sensing solutions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a wrapped rib mesh reflector antenna with spring hinges and column stoppers for a high precision reflector surface. To achieve a high precision surface, twelve spring hinges and column stoppers are employed on the center hub, and curved ribs are connected to each spring hinge. The curved ribs are designed based on the parabola equation and are made of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP), which has both high elasticity and flexibility, enabling the ribs to be wrapped into a compact circular shape around the center hub. A conducting mesh with high reflectivity is attached to the upper surface of the deployable structure. In this configuration, the mesh can form a parabolic shape consistent with the parabola equation used in the design of the curved ribs. Therefore, the proposed mesh reflector can form a high precision reflector surface. Moreover, when the reflector is stowed in the rocket payload, the diameter of the reflector is reduced from 1.5 m to 0.2 m, and the height is maintained as 0.26 m. This means that the fabricated model has a deployment volume of 0.585 m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> (1.5 m × 1.5 m × 0.26 m) and a stowed volume of 0.0104 m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> (0.2 m × 0.2 m × 0.26 m), thus achieving the volume-reduction efficiency of 98.22%. To verify the electrical characteristic of the proposed antenna, the bore-sight gains of the proposed antenna are measured in the far-field environment. The measured average bore-sight gain and aperture efficiency from 2 GHz to 6 GHz are 27.4 dBi and 18.1%, respectively, which agrees well with the simulated results of 26.7 dBi and 14.4%. These results show a 4.4 dB decrease compared to the average bore-sight gain (31.8 dBi) when using a gold-coated molybdenum mesh with 97% reflectivity."

Seventy-one participants (including 44 healthy controls and 27 SCI patients) were recruited for the experiment. The results showed that UDCNN-BiTCN achieved an average accuracy of 91.47% on the S-UD task and 91.81% on the UD task. The study also conducted within-subject cross-task transfer learning and cross-subject experiments, further validating the superiority of the model. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of this new paradigm from the perspective of classification performance. The research approach and findings in this study provide a valuable new perspective for BCI applications in the recovery of urinary and defecation functions."

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving of bicycles and motorcycles represents a critical advancement in intelligent transportation systems. To address the functional limitations of existing two-wheeled robots (TWRs) in executing tasks independently, this study develops a novel twin control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) single-track two-wheeled robot featuring a rotatable work module (swing arm). To resolve roll-angle balance and steady-state locomotion challenges in such TWRs, the system dynamics were first established based on Lagrange equations, which reveal complex coupling interactions across multiple degrees of freedom. Subsequently, a sliding mode control (SMC) framework is designed with Lyapunov-theory-based stability guarantees. The controller parameters are optimized via sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Compared with stable locomotion in conventional TWRs, swing arm rotation induces parametric inertia perturbations, generating steady-state deviations and potentially limit-cycle oscillations in state variables. The proposed architecture enables robust balance control during parking, straight-line motion, and steering maneuvers. When the swing arm rotates at a constant speed, the vehicle can negotiate a 20° slope and a 0.13 m step at a speed of 7.2 km/h. These findings provide foundational insights for the functional expansion of autonomous two-wheeled platforms."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a robot active task cognition framework for Situation-Aware Task Planning (SATP), leveraging visual scene understanding to generate action sequences. By integrating object knowledge, user preferences, and Large Language Models (LLMs), SATP interprets the robot’s current visual perception, and creates procedural actions that align with what the robot “sees”. Diverging from conventional methods requiring explicit verbal commands, our SATP framework autonomously performs task cognition, actively formulating robot-executable action sequences directly from visual input. Initially, a novel approach for describing the visual scene is presented, enabling the robot to grasp detailed object-level properties and inter-object relationships based on its observations. Building on this, a knowledge base for active task cognition is constructed using ontology technology. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage dual-feedback task planner, ReProg+, powered by LLMs, specifically designed for situation-aware task planning grounded in visual data. The efficacy, reliability, and advantages of our solution are thoroughly validated in real-world visual scenarios. Additionally, SATP has been tested with a real robot, with results confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Satellite computing, as an emerging edge computing paradigm, extends computing and networking services into space. Due to the internal design constraints of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the challenges posed by the external environment, satellite computing faces inherent limitations, including severely constrained resources, non-rechargeable batteries, poor heat dissipation, and highly dynamic operating conditions, leading to unreliable and unsustainable quality of service. To address the above challenges and fully realize the potential of satellite computing, this paper investigates temperature- and energy-aware dynamic task scheduling and computing resource allocation, aiming to optimize service latency, reduce onboard energy consumption, and enhance operational profit. Solving this problem requires coordinating task scheduling and resource allocation, balancing communication and computation latency, and addressing the challenge of a vast search space. To solve the above challenges, we first formulate this problem as a repeated Stackelberg game by developing temperature and energy models. Through theoretical analysis, we show that this game leads to a convex optimization framework that exhibits exponential complexity. To accelerate the search for the Stackelberg equilibrium solution, we propose a dynamic task scheduling algorithm based on the interior point method, which reduces the computational complexity to polynomial order. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces task scheduling latency by 28.4% and improves utility by 13% on average."

    "abstract": "Wireless power transfer enhanced mobile edge computing (WPT-MEC) has emerged as a key technology to support low-latency and energy-efficient computation in wireless networks. With increasing network density, multi-base-station architectures emerge where wireless devices (WDs) offload tasks to distributed base stations (BSs), creating challenges in maintaining quality-of-service fairness during complex resource coordination in multi-BS WPT-MEC networks. To address these challenges, we investigate a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enhanced WPT-MEC network comprising multiple WDs and BSs with finite computational capacities. For ensuring fairness, we formulate a max-min problem to maximize the minimum task computation amount by jointly optimizing offloading decisions, NOMA decoding orders, offloading powers and time resource allocation, which results in a challenging mixed integer, sequence and nonlinear programming (MISNLP). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage distributed multi-agent algorithm. In the first stage, each BS agent generates offloading preferences based on partial observations, guiding WDs' offloading decisions. In the second stage, given these offloading decisions, we develop an efficient convex-based algorithm to solve the per-BS resource allocation subproblem, jointly optimizing NOMA decoding order, offloading powers and time resource allocation. For effective training, we leverage off-policy training and the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm with two key innovations: (1) a convex-based critic that evaluates the joint action without bias, and (2) a counterfactual baseline that isolates individual agent credit assignment. The proposed C3MA algorithm achieves six times faster convergence and at least 20% performance improvement when serving more than 20 WDs, compared with existing multi-agent schemes, while maintaining a near-optimal Jain's fairness index of 0.97. Moreover, it sustains an ultra-low execution delay below 5 milliseconds even with 40 WDs, confirming its efficiency and scalability."

As a corollary, the analysis of the test error for linear classifiers can be reduced to Gaussian data from diffusion-generated data. Analyzing the performance of models trained on synthetic data is a pertinent problem due to the surge of methods such as [1].

The reflected field formulations for both convex side and concave side incidences on the cylindrically curved screen are provided for the bistatic case. The incident field and reflected field phase detours are obtained for the bistatic case as they are essential in formulating the diffracted field. These phase detours play a critical role in providing the continuity of the fields at and around the shadow boundaries due to the straight edges of the curved screen. In addition, the reciprocity condition has been verified with respect to the case of grazing incidence at the edges. The electromagnetic scattering due to plane wave incidence on the concave side of the curved screen is also presented using the curved screen uniform theory of diffraction. The predictions of the curved screen uniform theory of diffraction are compared with the results of the method of moments based electromagnetic simulation tool."

However, the complexity of traffic environments and the inherent limitations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in dealing with feature uncertainty have collectively resulted in a stagnation in the development of traffic object detection. To surmount these challenges, this study explores the combination of fuzzy theory with deep learning object detectors. Specifically, the features are first transformed into the fuzzy domain through fuzzification, and then the improved lightweight fuzzy inference method is employed for information interaction and selection, effectively managing and mitigating feature uncertainty. By merging the fuzzy strategy with YOLOv6 framework, a novel Fuzzy-based YOLO-style detector (F-YOLO) was proposed. F-YOLO is distinguished by three key innovations: the fuzzy fusion module, the fuzzy attention mechanism and the GPBblock. These components respectively bolster multi-scale feature fusion in the neck, refine prediction efficiency in the head, and enhance the global contextual learning of the backbone. Comprehensive experiments conducted across various datasets, including those tailored for traffic object detection, establish F-YOLO's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in YOLO-style detectors. F-YOLO demonstrates robustness and wide applicability, notably surpassing comparison models by 20.7% on VisDrone2019 dataset, 1.3% on BDD100K, and 6.2% on UA-DETRAC. Furthermore, F-YOLO also achieved competitive results on the MS COCO dataset."

    "abstract": "Vacuum interrupters are a key technology for current interruption in medium- and high-voltage electricity distribution networks. For certification, they must, among other requirements, withstand standardized lighting impulse voltages. This renders efficient and reliable means of assessing withstand capability critical to the design and development of vacuum interrupters. Crucially, the processes underlying failures to withstand an applied voltage are stochastic, so such assessments require statistical testing. These tests are commonly performed under the assumption that the responses (withstand or breakdown) to applied voltage pulses are statistically independent. However, the response of vacuum gaps is known to exhibit memory effects (or “hysteresis”) and can depend sensitively on factors such as experimental setup, testing procedure, and electrode material. In this study, we consider two testing schemes and demonstrate that the resultant estimates of $2 \\%$ probability breakdown voltage differ substantially. We further note a strong correlation between breakdown probability and the number of withstood pulses since the last breakdown. To capture this correlation, we propose a novel, history-dependent model of breakdown probability. While this model does not reflect the variety of physical mechanisms that could plausibly induce memory effects, it allows us to reconcile the seemingly conflicting data from both testing schemes. It thereby opens the door to comparing test results obtained in different campaigns using different procedures in a meaningful manner. This in turn promises insights into the withstand performance of vacuum gaps that were previously obscured by inconsistencies due to inadequate treatment of the correlated nature of responses."

In the test, the double vacuum gaps were achieved by series connecting two pairs of copper sphereplane electrodes with diameters of 18 and 50 mm, respectively. The experimental results revealed that, there existed a polarity effect of BD voltage for double vacuum gaps. The BD voltage under positive LIV was higher than that under negative LIV. When the total gap distance was 1.5 mm, the difference between the BD voltage under positive and negative LIVs was only 2.1 kV. The increase in gap distance would enlarge this difference and make the polarity effect more significant, which reached 19.5 kV at 3.0 mm. Through the electric field analysis, the polarity effect of BD voltage should be mainly induced by the difference of maximum electric field strengths at cathode under positive and negative LIVs."

For this purpose, butt and axial magnetic field contacts, originally designed for AC interruption, have been subjected to a variety of DC amplitudes and arcing times in a model vacuum interrupter. The interruption behavior of each contact geometry showed a strong dependency on the short circuit current amplitude. In this setup, butt contacts started to fail at lower current amplitudes and arcing times compared to axial magnetic field contacts. Due to high local current densities, an increased amount of metal vapor plasma within the contact gap caused this breakdown behavior. Since the switching performance of vacuum interrupters strongly depends on the amount of charge carriers present in the contact gap at current zero, this phenomenon must be considered when developing contact geometries for DC interruption. This study shows that vacuum interrupters exhibit reduced switching performance when interrupting static constricted vacuum arcs compared to diffuse vacuum arcs. The behavior of rotating constricted arcs, however, remains to be investigated and compared to diffuse arcs."

    "abstract": "CuCr material has high voltage resistance and excellent breaking capacity, and is widely used in medium and high voltage vacuum interrupters. The preparation process of CuCr is mainly divided into four types, powder metallurgy process, vacuum infiltration process, vacuum casting process and vacuum arc melting process, among which the CuCr material produced via powder metallurgy is extensively employed as contact material in circuit breaker interrupters under low contact force owing to its superior resistance to welding. At present, the preparation process of CuCr contact materials prepared by powder metallurgy is mainly divided into single press single sinter(SPSS) and double press double sinter(DPDS). This study employs CuCr30 alloy composition to conduct a comparative investigation on the performance of contact materials fabricated using these two preparation processes. The results indicate that the contact material processed by SPSS exhibits lower homogeneity than that processed by DPDS. Specifically, the single-processed material demonstrates approximately $\\mathbf{1. 5 4 \\%}$ to $\\mathbf{2. 2 5 \\%}$ lower density, 1.1 to 2.2 HB lower hardness, and $0.1 \\%$ to $0.7 \\%$ IACS lower electrical conductivity at the edge region relative to the center.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an enhanced Sun-Tracking Microwave Radiometry approach for atmospheric and solar characterization at millimeter-wave frequencies, specifically at W-band. Sun-Tracking radiometry is a ground-based technique that uses the Sun as a stable natural source to simultaneously estimate the Sun's brightness temperature and the atmospheric optical thickness. We propose a dynamic modeling of the Sun–Earth geometry to account for seasonal variations, achieving a 50% reduction in the standard deviation of the Sun brightness temperature compared to previous studies. For the first time, we quantify the impact of Sun brightness temperature estimation errors on the retrieval of atmospheric attenuation, addressing an open issue previously unassessed in the literature. The analysis relies on a long-term dataset collected over three years in Rome, NY (USA), representing one of the few ground-based databases capable of statistically characterizing atmospheric attenuation in all-weather conditions at K-, Ka-, V-, and W-bands. Results confirm that improvements in Sun brightness temperature estimation do not compromise the precision of atmospheric optical thickness retrievals, validating the robustness and reliability of the enhanced Sun-Tracking technique. These findings offer new insights for microwave remote sensing and propagation studies at millimeter wavelengths, supporting next-generation satellite communication and remote sensing systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid poles asymmetric interior permanent magnet (HPAIPM) motor topology for electric vehicle applications featuring the combined utilization of rare-earth and ferrite permanent magnets (PMs). It fully utilizes the magnetic-field-shifting effect in improving torque density by adding a ferrite at the upper part of the V-shaped asymmetric rare earth PM pole and optimizes the harmonic distribution of the air-gap magnetic field to achieve a significant reduction in torque ripple. In response to the optimization challenges of complex rotor structure motors, this work applies surrogate-assisted methods to achieve rapid optimization. Firstly, a constraint space Latin hypercube design algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of selecting sampling points in a confined space composed of strong constraints on design variables. This not only avoids the generation of invalid points but also optimizes the spatial distribution characteristics of sampling points, reducing the prediction error of the surrogate model by 29.1%. Secondly, a surrogate modeling method based on transfer learning neural network is given, which freezes some hidden layer coefficients of the neural network to avoid repeated training of surrogate models corresponding to different ferrite materials, reducing the number of training samples by 60%. According to the optimal design scheme, the proposed HPAIPM topology can reduce torque ripple by over 80% and maintain high torque density compared to conventional interior PM and asymmetric interior PM topology. Finally, a small prototype of the proposed HPAIPM topology is designed, manufactured and tested for validation."

    "abstract": "Performance Enhancement Proxies (PEPs) are widely used to improve TCP performance in geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite networks, which experience long RTT (approximately 500 ms). As a split TCP-based solution, PEP divides the end-to-end connection into multiple sub-connections, each independently managing its own rate control, including both congestion and flow control. This independence naturally leads to rate imbalances, manifested as an abnormal on-off traffic pattern-a phenomenon confirmed by our experimental observations in real-world GEO satellite networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this on-off traffic pattern not only undermines fairness but also reduces throughput, particularly for small-sized flows. To address this problem, we propose PEP-Policer, an automatic rate limiter for PEP to limit the link with higher rate to the lower one. Unlike traditional rate limiting methods that require manual configuration of the target rate, PEP-Policer employs a finite state machine to automatically determine and enforce the appropriate target rate. Moreover, as an add-on, PEP-Policer is compatible with all PEP-based solutions and can be integrated without modifying existing systems. Extensive evaluations in an emulated GEO satellite network show that PEP-Policer improves TCP's fairness and increases goodput by up to 63.0% for Cubic, 49.6% for BBR, and 88.6% for Hybla."

This study investigates the impact of instruction methods and task size on assembly errors, assembly time, and physical workload in manual assembly processes. Two instruction methods were compared: paper-based and screen-based (animation), in conjunction with two assembly tasks that varied in part size (large and small). The physical workload was assessed by measuring the electromyography (EMG) signals of the participants’ right arm muscles and heart rate variability (HRV). Twenty-eight participants were recruited to perform the assembly tasks under different conditions. A mixed experimental design was used to analyse the effects of instruction method and task size on assembly time, errors, muscle activity, and HRV. The study results indicate that task size significantly influences assembly time and error rates, with small-sized tasks generally associated with higher error rates. Furthermore, the instruction method affects the physical workload, as reflected in the EMG and HRV measurements. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interaction between instruction methods, task size, and the ergonomic demands of manual assembly, providing insights for optimizing assembly processes and reducing worker strain."

    "abstract": "Vacuum interrupter is the critical component within medium and high voltage vacuum circuit breakers. Its vacuum contacts are responsible for interrupting high current. However, surface irregularities on contacts in vacuum can enhance field emission through localized electric field concentration, thereby degrading the insulation performance of the circuit breakers. Therefore, understanding and regulating contact surface microfeatures has become a key research focus for enhancing insulation performance of vacuum circuit breakers. In this work, the insulation performance of different surface microfeatures (Cu substrate and Cr grain) on the vacuum contacts was investigated using an in-situ electrical measurement system. The microtopographical evolution before and after breakdown was also examined. Results show that the breakdown mechanisms differ regionally. On Cu substrate, breakdown is caused by thermal runaway at the anode first (tungsten spheres), vaporization of atoms from anode surface, driven by the electric field or electron impact, results in plasma formation that bridges the gap. For Cr grain, field electron emission initiates at microprotrusions on cathode (Cr grain), with Joule heating accumulating within the grain to ultimately form a molten layer. In addition, Cr grain exhibits a higher breakdown voltage threshold $(387 \\mathrm{~V})$ than Cu substrate $(233 \\mathrm{~V})$, demonstrating that elevated Cr content in $\\mathrm{Cu}-\\mathrm{Cr}$ contacts substantially enhances insulation performance. This novel method enables in-situ investigation of breakdown behaviors across typical microfeatures, revealing mechanistic relationship between surface microtopography and insulation performance. These findings are expected to contribute to insulation enhancement and bottom-up contact design for high-performance vacuum circuit breakers."

When the BD charge exceeded 0.1 mC, significant melting of the cathode was observed, without adhesion of anode material. In such cases, the sustained component of the discharge current was dominant; however, excessive cathode melting could lead to a reduction in dielectric strength. Conversely, when the BD charge was less than 0.1 mC, more pronounced melting of the anode occurred, accompanied by the adhesion of anode material to the cathode surface. The ratio of BD charge to Joule heat was used as an index of the current waveform characteristics. A higher ratio indicated a dominant sustained component, while a lower ratio reflected stronger oscillatory behavior. Under lower-ratio conditions, increased adhesion of anode material was observed. Furthermore, dielectric strength tended to improve when less anode material adhered to the cathode. These results indicate that improving dielectric strength requires preventing excessive cathode melting and minimizing the adhesion of anode material. Overall, the findings suggest that effective conditioning depends on carefully balancing the sustained and oscillatory components of the discharge current waveform, namely BD charge and energy."

The proposed system enables continuous monitoring of bee colonies, providing real-time insights into environmental changes and bee behavior. In addition, the system's analytical tools can identify and analyze correlations between following factors affecting bee productivity, such as weather conditions, geographical location of the apiary, and other environmental influences.The introduction of this stand-alone beekeeping solution offers beekeepers the ability to remotely track key hive conditions. For instance, it can detect whether the temperature inside the hive is nearing critical levels, or whether the bees are facing food shortages. This timely information allows beekeepers to take swift action to prevent potential harm to the colonies, thereby improving overall colony health and productivity. Such a system must be particularly beneficial during winter, helping to preserve hibernating bee colonies, while also saving valuable time and resources typically spent on manual hive inspections.The autonomous beekeeping system aligns with the broader goals of promoting economically sustainable agriculture, supporting the conservation of agricultural and forestry resources. The introduction of advanced monitoring and control features ensures that beekeepers can maintain optimal hive conditions with minimal manual intervention. Moreover, as the project progresses, we are planning further enhancements, such as incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including neural networks, to enhance image processing capabilities.

    "abstract": "In response to the problem of incomplete credit assessment caused by multi-source data silos in the current coal supply chain finance field, this study proposes an AI-enabled credit assessment and loan optimization system under multi-source data fusion. By constructing a four-dimensional data fusion layer (production-end sensor data, logistics GPS trajectory, transaction electronic invoice, and external price/policy data), using knowledge graphs to model the supply chain topology network, and using federated learning to achieve cross-enterprise data privacy protection. A hybrid AI evaluation model is designed, integrating LightGBM/XGBoost to process structured data and GNN to extract supply chain guarantee relationship characteristics, and combined with SHAP interpretable analysis to reveal that inventory turnover rate and price fluctuation sensitivity are core risk factors. The innovative introduction of reinforcement learning dynamic credit algorithm allows the credit limit to be adjusted in real time with coal price fluctuations, and the deployment of blockchain smart contracts enables automatic loan release after goods delivery. Empirical evidence shows that the system has increased the credit assessment F1 value to 91.2%, reduced the bad debt rate to 1.18%, and shortened the loan decision-making time to 2.1 hours, providing a new paradigm of data collaborative governance and intelligent decision-making for coal supply chain financial risk management."

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new method for converting structured bibliographic data into a natural language-based Question Answering (QA) system built on a Large Language Model (LLM). The method, called Semantic Similarity Understanding Network (SSUN), combines a Transformer encoder for identifying semantic relationships between data entries with a text-to-text generation model for producing contextually appropriate answers. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments by using paraphrased queries and compared SSUN with several baseline models, including T5-Base, T5-Small, BART, and ProphetNet. The results indicate that SSUN achieves higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in handling queries that are semantically equivalent but phrased differently. Notably, SSUN can also detect and appropriately respond to out-of-domain questions by returning “no relevant information” instead of generating inaccurate results. These findings suggest that SSUN provides a more flexible and semantically aware interface for querying structured bibliographic data through natural language."

    "abstract": "In the context of rapid development of financial technology, credit risk control of small and medium-sized banks is constrained by data silos and sample imbalance. This paper proposes a co-construction scheme of credit risk control model for small and medium-sized banks based on federated transfer learning, and designs an improved federated adversarial transfer learning algorithm. The algorithm strengthens the extraction of key risk features through the attention mechanism, optimizes cross-domain knowledge transfer by using adversarial networks, and realizes model aggregation by adaptive weight adjustment. The experiment uses the UCI credit data set and simulated small and medium-sized bank data, and is carried out under the FATE federated learning framework. The algorithm is compared with five algorithms including FedAvg and XGBoost. The results show that the accuracy of the algorithm reaches 92.3%, which is 7.8 percentage points higher than FedAvg and 5.2 percentage points higher than XGBoost; the recall rate is 89.5%, which is 6.2 and 4.1 percentage points higher than the comparison algorithm respectively; the F1 value reaches 90.9%, which is the best. The model converged stably within 150 iterations, and the convergence speed was 30% higher than that of the traditional algorithm. The privacy attack experiment showed that the scheme could reduce the success rate of member reasoning attacks to 3.2%, significantly protecting data privacy. The experiment confirmed that the scheme effectively improved the performance of the credit risk control model of small and medium-sized banks and achieved safe and efficient model co-construction."

    "abstract": "Addressing angle sensitivity in radar-based gait recognition is placed at the main focus for achieving omnidirection human gait recognition using radar sensors, whereas sufficient data support with full annotations raises a great challenge in this research field. This paper presents a methodology called Tri-SG, which accomplishes gait recognition under random walking conditions by relying solely on a limited amount of radial-moving annotated data support. The Tri-SG is implemented in a semi-supervised manner, incorporating the proposed additional dual consistency mechanisms, resulting in significantly improving the model's efficacy irrespective of human movement directions. Alongside the standard consistency regularization, the first consistency design incorporates domain consistency regularization, which is essential for leveraging the knowledge gained from labeled samples by establishing a knowledge-sharing feature space. The other consistency approach is an elaborated adversarial consistency learning scheme that ensures consistency regularization not being susceptible to the non-i.i.d. scenarios. We conducted radar measurements and subsequently carried out experiments using two datasets derived from these measurements to assess the performance of our model. The comparisons with eight approaches confirm the superiority of the Tri-SG model in this task, and it is surprising that our model achieves over 90% accuracy while utilizing only 2% annotated radial-moving radar spectrograms during the semi-supervised learning process. Ablation studies were carried out to confirm the effectiveness of our designs, while additional parameter studies investigated the model's vulnerability and stability in relation to variations in the relevant parameters."

Although traditional privacy protection schemes can improve security to a certain extent, there is still a risk of data leakage when facing semi-trusted cloud servers. To this end, this paper proposes an anonymized face verification scheme for IoT convergence scenarios, which achieves real-time retrieval and secure matching of dense face features in virtual device copies by combining homomorphic encryption (CKKS) and privacy information retrieval (PIR) for anonymized face verification. The scheme ensures that the semi-trusted cloud server cannot obtain user-specific index information and matching results. Experiments show that the scheme’s verification accuracy in the ciphertext state on the LFW dataset is consistent with the plaintext, up to 97.06%, and can complete a privacy-protected anonymized facial verification process within seconds. The scheme is feasible in security demanding scenarios."

In addition, the rationale for dosimetric quantities prescribed in international exposure guidelines, such as the specific absorption rate (SAR) and absorbed power density, is revisited in relation to their correlation with local and core temperature rises in various tissues and populations. A heating factor, which is defined as a steady-state temperature rise per SAR, for the brain, eye lens, skin, and body core is evaluated to estimate heating resulting from exposure to electromagnetic fields. The transition of a physical quantity in the guidelines at 6 GHz, from SAR to the absorbed power density, is discussed along with the optimal spatial averaging volume and areas. Computational evaluations of product compliance, 5G devices, and wireless power transfer systems are also reviewed.

    "abstract": "The practical application of aerial-aquatic robots is hindered by severe impact loads during water entry. Existing load reduction methods are inefficient for robots requiring rapid, high-frequency aerial-aquatic transitions. Therefore, this study proposes an active learning based joint optimization framework for nose profiles and water-entry strategies, which is fully automated. Specifically, an 8-dimensional parameter space is defined for generating dataset inputs through Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Furthermore, a Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) surrogate model is trained under different water-entry strategies, in order to predict peak impact loads and quantify prediction uncertainty for varying nose profiles. Within each active learning loop, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) guides the selective labelling of samples to expand the dataset, and the DKL model is iteratively retrained until convergence. Compared against state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach reduces the number of required high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to 65% of that of the comparison methods, while achieving maximum reductions of 66.9% in axial and 72.8% in normal impact loads across the parameter space, respectively. Notably, under the water-entry strategies employed by the hunting behavior of gannets, the approach yields profiles closely matching the skull morphology of the northern gannet. In this case, this work not only delivers an efficient and reliable impact loads reduction solution for aerial-aquatic robots, but also reveals the role of natural selection in minimizing such loads."

    "abstract": "Medical image fusion aims to synthesize relevant and complementary information from different modalities, thereby enhancing clinical diagnosis. Current deep learning-based fusion approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable results due to their strong capacity for modeling long-range dependencies. However, there are still limitations in capturing sufficient global information because of the window-based local attention mechanism. Moreover, existing fusion schemes predominantly focus on spatial features while rarely considering spectral features, thus affecting the fusion performance. To address these challenges, we propose a new unsupervised cross-modal spectrum-aware fusion framework, named SpectFusion, for medical image fusion. Specifically, we devise a spatial-spectrum hybrid block, which effectively extracts fine-grained local features via a gradient retention strategy in the spatial domain, and captures global features with an image-wide receptive field through Fourier convolution in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we develop a novel cross-modal spectrum-aware attention to facilitate spatial-spectrum information interactions during fusion. It dynamically guides the retention of relevant spectral components while integrating multimodal spatial features. Additionally, to achieve more precise alignment image pairs, we incorporate a refined registration module to correct minor local deviations. We also define corresponding frequency and spatial domain losses to jointly constrain the proposed SpectFusion. By leveraging spatial-spectrum information interactions, fine-grained fusion can be adaptively realized. Extensive experiments, including clinical brain tumor image fusion, demonstrate that SpectFusion outperforms other state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. We show that SpectFusion can boost performance in downstream tasks such as multimodal medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/PlumW/SpectFusion."

    "abstract": "Helicopter Transient Electromagnetic (HTEM) instrument systems now require dual-waveform (high/low-energy) current inverters for single-flight shallow/deep detection in complex terrains. Low-energy waveforms require earlier observation windows and stronger excitation to enhance shallow-resolution, but current designs using fixed clamping voltage and long current tails limit shallow data acquisition. This paper proposes a dual-clamping coordinated dual-waveform current inverter. A series-type fast on-off module, without compromising high-energy performance, increases the low-energy waveform clamping voltage from 450V to 720V or higher, amplifying electromagnetic excitation. By modeling parasitic capacitance, damping resistors are optimally selected to eliminate turn-off oscillations. Through damping optimization via extended high-voltage clamping duration, the current tail decay time was shortened from 23.1μs to 10.6μs. Results from forward modeling in complex terrains demonstrate that the proposed current inverter achieved a 2.86-fold increase in the response amplitude variation of the earliest time gate. The dual-clamping current inverter presents an innovative dual-waveform design, significantly enhancing shallow detection performance and providing a practical framework for advancing HTEM applications."

    "abstract": "The increased demand for autonomous robots in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics is driven by the need to address labor shortages and enhance operational efficiency. A critical aspect of these robots is their ability to navigate complex environments autonomously, which relies heavily on multiple artificial intelligence models, including visual odometry. Visual odometry enables robots to estimate their motion by analyzing visual data, making it essential for navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, ensuring such models operate within real-time constraints is paramount for the robot’s responsiveness, safety, and overall functionality. The complexity and depth of such a model, which utilizes camera images and other sensor data, make it challenging to achieve real-time performance. Thus, this paper thoroughly evaluates the performance of a deep-learning visual odometry model, with a focus on its execution time and computational overhead. Furthermore, it proposes an optimized implementation to meet the stringent real-time requirements for safe and efficient robot operation. The optimization is achieved through algorithm improvement to preserve the model structure and accuracy. Multiple hardware platforms were utilized to demonstrate the resource differences between edge, fog, and cloud deployments, thereby validating the effect of the proposed model optimization. The resource usage is also compared to see the impact of the modification on multiple aspects, including computation, memory, temperature, and energy. The resulting model operationalization improves the execution time while highlighting limitations for some hardware configurations."

Methods have been published and evaluated in experimental vehicles to secure safe AV control in the presence of attacks, but human motion comfort is rarely investigated in such studies. In this paper, we present an innovative optimal-coupling-observer-based framework that rejects the impact of bounded sensor attacks in a network of connected and automated vehicles from safety and comfort point of view. We demonstrate its performance in car following with cooperative adaptive cruise control for platoons with redundant distance and velocity sensors. The error dynamics are formulated as a Linear Time Variant (LTV) system, resulting in complex stability conditions that are investigated using a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) approach guaranteeing global asymptotic stability. We prove the capability of the framework to secure occupants’ safety and comfort in the presence of bounded attacks. In the onset of attack, the framework rapidly detects attacked sensors and switches to the most reliable observer eliminating attacked sensors, even with modest attack magnitudes. Without our proposed method, severe (but bounded) attacks result in collisions and major discomfort. With our method, attacks had negligible effects on motion comfort evaluated using ISO-2631 Ride Comfort and Motion Sickness indexes. The results pave the path to bring comfort to the forefront of AVs security."

    "abstract": "There is a large lag in the development of efficient surface-emitting ultraviolet (UV) lasers compared to visible and infrared lasers. Most efforts have been directed towards incremental improvements in fabrication techniques. In this work, a systematic simulation-driven approach is proposed to optimize GaN/AlGaN nanowire (NW)-based photonic crystal (PhC) laser structures, which have potential applications in disinfection, sensing and non-line-of-sight communications. The method employs 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional solvers to prescreen leaky designs and refine the structural parameters, which are then further analyzed using 3-dimensional simulations for the final optimization. A new physical analysis of the PhC mode and its diffracted components is proposed. This analysis provides insight into the interplay between PhC, NW, and air modes and its effect on the performance of NW PhC lasers. A simplified approach to the complex multi-parameter optimization problem for NW waveguide structures is developed that not only improves the performance of UV lasers but also establishes general design principles for surface-emitting NW-based PhC lasers. These guidelines are primarily concerned with ensuring that structures accommodate the PhC mode well, which depend on the layer thicknesses of the NW waveguide. Implementing these guidelines can result in more than a 60-fold improvement in the NW PhC laser performance. It is further suggested to optimize for surface output efficiency rather than Q-factor and introduce absorption losses once a suitable structure has been found. This framework represents a robust and computationally efficient pathway for future development in optimizing the NW waveguide design, paving the way for cost-effective and high performance UV light-emitting devices."

This technology allows for the creation of result obtained that can be trained regionally in the endpoints, trying to improve both utilization and secrecy for model prediction instruction. Although machine learning needs a primary key to coordinate the training of the model, in certain IoT networks the communication across gadgets and transmission lines might be restricted. This hinders the implementation of deep learning. Mentor training, that does not necessitate such an integrator, seems to be a viable way around problem. The security issues with IoT installations, on the other hand, have encouraged the usage of computer science for threat and fault diagnosis. When using supervised methods to solve these issues, the trained samples are often unbalanced, meaning that there are more harmless pieces of information than anomalous. This necessitates the employment of rebalance strategies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods. In this research, we present a new mentoring technique, P2PK-SMOTE, which result in increasing to locally s actually the training examples by synthetic production of datasets from either the minority class, to train unsupervised abnormality identification models for machine learning in non-IID contexts. In order to lower the danger of data and improve results in semi contexts, we additionally integrate a method for exchanging a small portion of synthetic data first from minority class between devices.

Extraction of the DCS blood flow index typically involves calculating the temporal autocorrelation of the measured light intensity and then fitting its decay to a solution of the correlation diffusion equation. It is well-known that the experimental autocorrelation is a biased estimator of the true autocorrelation. This work explores this phenomenon as it relates to DCS, in particular implementations with single photon avalanche diode arrays (SPAD arrays). After deriving a first-order expression for the bias in DCS, we then quantify its impact as a function of sampling time in both simulation and experiment using SPAD array detection. We then present and explore two bias correction strategies to correct for its impact at fast sampling times (20-200 Hz) and in low-photon regimes."

    "abstract": "Existing low-light enhancement methods typically rely on fitting data mappings (pixel-wise mappings through fully supervised methods or distribution-wise mappings through weakly supervised or self-supervised methods). However, their performance is heavily dependent on specific scenes and fails to adequately model the intrinsic prior of natural images, resulting in poor generalization. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the strengths of powerful generative diffusion models, conditioned on a thoughtfully designed prior, and propose a novel zero-reference low-light enhancement framework that gets rid of dependence on the distribution of low-light images. In detail, we address the most fundamental core by proposing an illumination-invariant prior derived from the theory of physical light transfer, bridging the gap between normal and low-light domains, and enabling zero-shot enhancement without the need for low-light-specific training. A prior-to-image restoration framework is built upon generative diffusion models, pre-trained on normal-light data. During inference, the framework extracts the illumination-invariant prior from low-light inputs and maps them back to high-quality images, naturally for low-light enhancement. Additionally, such intrinsic properties of illumination-invariant prior open up opportunities for distilling diffusion models into compact CNN-based networks. We propose a novel prior-injected distillation paradigm incorporating intensity, frequency, and gradient domain-augmented regularization comprehensively. This distillation framework not only reduces computational costs but also maintains high fidelity and perceptual quality in enhanced outputs, making it more efficient and practical for real-world applications. The approach further extends seamlessly to handle over-exposure scenarios, demonstrating its versatility in addressing complex lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in various scenarios, as well as its strong interpretability, robustness, and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Social bot detection plays a crucial role in enabling social media platforms and governments to effectively manage and regulate social networks. Existing methods, which typically rely on multi-modal feature fusion, often concentrate on interactions between paired accounts and their immediate neighbors, overlooking the dynamic evolution of social networks over time. To address this gap, we propose a community-aware spatio-temporal hypergraph contrastive learning method for social bot detection, namely BotSTHCL. Specifically, we construct a temporal community-aware hypergraph and apply a contrastive learning framework in a semi-supervised setting, facilitating the effective extraction and representation of node features. Our model not only captures interactions among multiple accounts within a community but also accounts for the evolving nature of social networks. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/FengLiuii/BotSTHCL."

    "abstract": "High-current vacuum arc (HCVA) under axial magnetic field (AMF) can be kept in diffuse status. Bell-shaped AMF, which is usually generated by traditional AMF contacts, is the most common AMF distribution. Different bell-shaped AMFs bring different influence to HCVAs. In this paper, the distribution of bell-shaped AMF with declined magnitude near the contact periphery was described by two characteristic parameters, i.e., the radius of center area $\\boldsymbol{R}_{\\text {center }}^{\\text {bell }}$ and the value of central AMF $B_{\\text {zcenter }}^{\\text {bell }}$. Then, HCVAs under bell-shaped AMFs with different characteristic parameters were simulated and analyzed based on a two-dimensional (2-D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. Simulation results showed that the change of $R_{\\text {center }}^{\\text {bell }}$ mainly influences the distribution of vacuum arc in the outer region of the arc, and the change of $\\boldsymbol{B}_{\\text {zcenter }}^{\\text {bell }}$ influences the distribution of vacuum arc in the whole region. Besides, relationship between the change of bellshaped AMF and the Hall electric field was also analyzed."

Removing burrs from milled aluminum alloy surfaces is a significant technical challenge. Polishing technique via lowpressure discharge, which is mainly developed for copper and steel, has been rarely studied for aluminum alloys. This study explores a deburring method for aluminum alloy using lowpressure discharge. High voltage is applied directly between the anode and cathode under low pressure, using aluminum alloy contacts as the cathode, to remove surface burrs through electrical breakdown. Experiments are conducted in a detachable vacuum chamber. The comparative investigation focuses on how the geometry of the anode contact affects the burr removal performance of two aluminum alloys. Surface changes before and after burr removal are then analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. Optimal polishing configuration is proposed."

With the development of modern technologies in an area of the composite micro/nano materials with thermoregulation properties is crucially important to increase comfortable characteristics for maintaining heat, waterproofness and air exchange. However, no matter what thermal insulation characteristics a fabric material has, excess heat or heat leakage occurs during use. A very narrow temperature range (±2°) is required for comfortable use and thermal regulation. At low temperature external conditions, additional heating is required, and in high temperature conditions, cooling is required. The article discusses the use of Peltier elements for thermal management of fabric. Widely available solid Peltier elements have limited use due to their small difference of temperature surfaces. Innovative decision to increase the effect of temperature difference consists of integration of the elaborated composite multilayer material in matrix of which in an orderly manner Peltier elements are placed. Based on the results of the study, recommendations were developed for the use of solid-state Peltier elements not only for heating, but also for cooling the surface. Thus, the use of thermoelements allows to get comfortable conditions inside the sleeping bag. To maintaining a comfortable temperature, control is used via a microcontroller, which monitors the temperature on the inner and outer surfaces of the multilayer material. Experimental data on the limiting capabilities of using typical Peltier elements are also provided."

    "abstract": "The Particle-in-Cell and Monte Carlo Collision (PIC-MCC) method is a powerful tool for simulating the postarc sheath stage in vacuum circuit breakers(VCBs), aiding in understanding this complex process. In PIC-MCC simulations, super-particles, sharing the same charge-to-mass ratio as real particles, represent large numbers of electrons or ions, reducing computational costs but introducing noise in results. The impact of super-particle number on simulation results, particularly during the post-arc sheath stage, remains unclear. This study investigates how varying the number of super-particles per cell affects simulation outcomes using a simplified 2D PIC-MCC model. The super-particle number per cell represents a specific plasma density within a cell, enabling plasma characterization at discrete spatial points. Simulations systematically vary this super-particle number per cell across $\\mathbf{1 0} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{2 0} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{4 0} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{5 0} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{8 0} \\boldsymbol{,} \\mathbf{1 0 0}$, and 150. Results show that increasing super-particles per cell smooths ion density distribution curves, reducing fluctuations. However, beyond a threshold of around 40 or 50 super-particles per cell, further increases offer minimal improvement. This study provides insights for the optimization of settings of future PIC-MCC simulations."

    "abstract": "Electric-field-induced damage and deformation at the nanoscale are critical issues for the performance and reliability of electronic devices and electrical equipment. Despite decades of vacuum breakdown research, the morphological evolution of electrode nanostructures under high electric fields remains poorly understood. In this paper, recent progress in numerical simulations and experimental studies on electric-field-induced deformation is reviewed. Atomistic simulations based on Kinetic Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods reveal how electric fields induce biased atomic surface diffusion and the growth of nanoprotrusions at grain boundaries or voids. Multiscale-multiphysics model further illustrates the thermal runaway of nanotips during field emission. Experimentally, while most studies focus on surface morphology before and after breakdown, our recent work reports the first direct in-situ observations of nanoprotrusions formation on carbon-coated nanoelectrodes and the shape and dislocation evolution of metallic nanotips under electric fields. The results provide microscopic evidence of shape deformation and the underlying mechanisms of electrical damage and failure in nanostructures under high electric fields. Finally, the challenges in simulations and experimental studies on deformation behaviors of nanostructures under intense electric fields are also discussed."

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in SF6-free technologies, there is an increasing demand for vacuum interrupters (VIs) that can operate at higher voltage levels. To meet these requirements, design solutions such as larger contact gaps and the series connection of multiple VIs are necessary. Larger gaps can lead to a specific behaviour of the arc and the attachment modes at the electrodes which depend in addition on the polarity of the moving contact. This paper focuses on the analysis of arc modes for larger gaps through a combination of electrical and optical data. Experiments were conducted using CuCr25 butt contacts at peak currents of up to 15 kA and a frequency of 35 Hz, with a contact gap of 30 mm at current zero, and with operating the moving contact as the anode or as the cathode. The arc behaviour was observed using a high-speed camera (HSC) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The HSC captures the arc dynamics, while a computer-aided evaluation facilitates the analysis of different arc modes. The OES results allow for an estimation of the spatial distribution of copper and chromium atoms and ions in particular in the region of the anode spots. Different arc behaviour and anode attachment modes were observed, particularly influenced by the polarity of the movable contact. The time after contact separation at which the arc changes into a jet mode is longer in case of the moved cathode in comparison with the moved anode."

    "abstract": "Partial arcs, spark discharges, and other destructive gaseous discharges frequently occur on overhead line, leading to insulation failure and power outages. Particle composition, as a fundamental parameter, governs discharge characteristics. This study focuses on partial arcs on the insulator-grading ring gap by analyzing rod-plane gap arc discharges under AC/DC voltage through emission spectroscopy. Characteristic species and reactions of arc are identified to construct a two-temperature discharge composition model. To address the model’s strong nonlinearity, a dimensional reduction approach combined with an advanced iterative algorithm is proposed. Numerical validation demonstrates that dimensional reduction compresses variables to the number of elemental species, while the new algorithm achieves a twelvefold speed improvement over conventional Newton iteration with comparable accuracy. Equilibrium analysis reveals that increasing the parameter θ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub> yields a non-monotonic ionization effect: electron density rises and then falls (inverse U-shaped profile), whereas neutral particle density decreases monotonically. These findings provide valuable reference data for discharge parameter calculations in insulation coordination and fundamental plasma modeling. The proposed numerical methods further offer efficient tools for investigating discharge physics in overhead line engineering."

Designing a secure yet efficient BTP is still a long-lasting challenge, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a promising building block for designing BTPs. In this study, we propose a novel pre-image attack applicable to lots of existing LSH-based BTPs, showing that many of them are in fact <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reversible</i>. Our attack leverages structural properties shared by several LSH-based BTPs. Through investigation, we formalize a certain class of LSHs vulnerable to our attack, called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PMA-LSH</i>, which contains several known LSH-based BTPs, even not-yet-cryptanalyzed ones. Furthermore, the recovered pre-image from our attack is much closer to the original template compared to previous attacks, facilitating recovery of the original biometrics via reconstruction attacks. With existing reconstruction methods, we successfully recovered biometrics from templates protected by several LSH-based BTPs. The recovered biometrics sufficiently resemble the original ones, so they can be further exploited to impersonate other recognition systems, including commercial APIs.

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes, they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour, ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods, including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets, and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for cardiovascular research."

    "abstract": "Recently, wideband oscillation events have frequently occurred in renewable power systems and made the system unstable. As a result, a method to identify the occurrence of the unstable oscillation event is needed. The existing methods usually use a long window to ensure high identification accuracy, while a long identification time will be introduced. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a fast and accurate identification method based on a data-driven method, i.e., the cubic spline interpolated fast Fourier transform-random forest (CSIPFFT-RF) method. The CSIPFFT is used to preprocess the waveform data and extract the amplitude variation features of the oscillation component quickly, and the feature data is used to train the RF to identify and classify the oscillations. In simulation tests, the proposed method is compared with the methods that use the traditional FFT and zero-padding FFT to preprocess the data, and the methods that use the back propagation, long short-term memory, and extreme learning machine to identify the oscillation. Results show that the proposed method has much higher accuracy (over 99%) and shorter identification time (about 1 s) than the existing methods under various scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method still has high performance even in untrained scenarios, especially when real data with dynamic harmonics, noise, and missing values are used."

While social support is considered a protective factor, its effects on caregiver stigma and disengagement remain underexplored, particularly in non-linear contexts. This study employs a hybrid approach combining Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to examine these psychosocial factors among 424 Chinese dementia caregivers. SEM revealed that psychological disengagement partially mediates the relationship between social support and stigma. Additionally, an SVM classifier was developed to predict stigma risk, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting non-linear patterns. The study underscores the importance of strengthening social support and promoting psychological disengagement as strategies to mitigate stigma. It also demonstrates the potential of SEM-SVM hybrid models in both explanatory and predictive tasks, offering valuable insights for precision intervention design in dementia caregiving."

    "abstract": "With the ongoing electrification of aircraft, there is growing interest in using vacuum contactors in electric aircraft due to their significant advantages. These contactors are particularly valued for their low operating losses, which contribute to higher efficiency, a critical factor in electric propulsion systems. Additionally, their ability to switch rapidly makes them well-suited for the frequent and dynamic switching required during various stages of an aircraft’s mission profile. However, despite these benefits, the electric arc generated during the switching process presents a considerable challenge. This issue is particularly concerning with the increasing use of DC systems in electric aircraft, as DC systems lack a natural current zero-crossing point. In this study, experiments on arc voltages during the opening of a vacuum contactor were conducted. The results show that vacuum arc voltage increases with current but generally remains between 10 V and 30 V across the range of currents investigated in this paper."

    "abstract": "Do pretrained speech models genuinely understand speech patterns, or do they simply learn to classify? We investigate this fundamental question by analyzing 10 state-of-the-art speech models across diverse tasks. We tested models on six speech characteristics (gender, accent, age, emotion, words, speaker identity) using both classification and clustering approaches. While models achieve impressive classification accuracy (up to $\\mathbf{1 0 0 \\%}$ for gender, $\\mathbf{9 4 . 9 \\%}$ for words), they show poor clustering performance when attempting to discover identical patterns without supervision. Most critically, we find systematic negative correlations between these capabilities—models better at accent classification are actually worse at discovering accent patterns through clustering ($\\mathrm{r}=-0.904$). Our analysis suggests that current speech models learn equilateral decision boundaries rather than orthogonal pattern representations, due to training objectives promoting uniform dimensional alignment, lacking orthogonality in multiple dimensions. These findings expose a critical evaluation crisis in self-supervised learning: current benchmarks may systematically overestimate model capabilities, as high classification scores do not guarantee the pattern discovery capabilities that form SSL’s core value proposition."

    "abstract": "Existing studies have shown that the high-frequency pre-breakdown arc generated by closing the capacitor bank of a $12 \\mathrm{kV} / 40.5 \\mathrm{kV}$ vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) can remove burrs, metal and non-metal particles and various contaminants on the contact surface, and effectively reduce its re-breakdown rate. The pre-arc electrical breakdown process is a prerequisite for the occurrence and development of the pre-breakdown arc, which determines the initial plasma characteristics of the pre-breakdown arc. However, the electrical breakdown characteristics of VCBs before closing arc are not clear. Most of them are studied from a macro perspective, lacking theoretical analysis from a micro perspective. Therefore, based on the field emission theory and fluid dynamics theory, a complete multi-scale and highly non-equilibrium pre-arc electrical breakdown model during the closing process of VCB is established in this paper. The generation and evolution behavior of charged particles and the formation mechanism of breakdown are analyzed from the micro perspective. It is found that the pre -arc electric breakdown discharge mechanism of the VCB closing process starts from the field emission at the micro-protrusions on the cathode surface, and then triggers the streamer discharge. After the formation of the plasma region, the positive space sheath region near the cathode leads to the distortion of the electric field intensity and strengthens the field emission process. Finally, the plasma discharge channel is formed. The research results can not only effectively reveal the pre-breakdown mechanism of VCBs, but also provide technical support for the design of VCBs with high performance parameters under capacitive interruption and phase selection strategies."

    "abstract": "With the development of the new power system and the implementation of the national “Double Carbon” goal, the development of the transmission grade vacuum switch to replace Sulfur hexa-fluoride (SF6) circuit breaker has become a research hot-spot in this field, among which the driving system of the long gap vacuum switch is one of the difficulties in technical research. Based on the driving system of the Vacuum Interrupter Unit (VIU) in environment friendly GIS, the physical model, dynamic description and dynamics model of the dual-actuated of back-to-back VIU are established. Through the analysis of the opening and closing process of VIU electrodes, it can be seen that the dual-actuated system can share the demand for the opening speed of the long gap interrupter, and the collision impulse can be offset greatly during the closing process, the rebound amplitude and bouncing time of the contacts during the closing process can be greatly reduced, which can reduce the harm. Taking the closing process of 252kV vacuum circuit breaker as an example, the process of closing bounce and vibration is described, and the technical problems in the motion damping and the synchronization requirements of dual-actuated operation are discussed. In order to prove the analytical results of the physical model, the calculation model of VIU contact motion parameters based on ADAMS dynamic simulation software was established, and the relevant parameters of 252kV vacuum circuit breaker dual-actuated system were simulated and analyzed. Compared with the same momentum condition of the single drive interrupter, the range and duration of the contact bounce during the closing process are significantly reduced. The comprehensive advantage demonstration using dual-actuated system needs further prototype measurement. The dual-actuated 252kV VIU provides a new structure scheme for the transmission grade vacuum circuit breaker."

    "abstract": "The practice of cycling is widely acknowledged for its substantial contributions to both individual health and environmental sustainability, as it not only enhances cardiovascular fitness levels but also plays a critical role in diminishing the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, despite these numerous advantages associated with cycling, individuals who engage in this activity face a variety of specific health challenges, which include musculoskeletal injuries stemming from repetitive strain, severe traumas to the lower extremities due to traffic collisions, and a range of more insidious neurological complications that may manifest over time. Traditional methods of diagnosis, which typically encompass physical examinations, imaging studies, and the subjective reporting of symptoms by patients, frequently prove inadequate when it comes to providing timely and precise insights into these diverse and multifaceted medical conditions. However, with the recent advancements in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the integration of multi-modal data, automated diagnostic systems are increasingly emerging as a transformative force within the realm of healthcare delivery. This article aims to present an extensive review of the various diseases related to cycling and to explore the ways in which automation can effectively address the limitations associated with traditional diagnostic methods while simultaneously fostering safer and more effective cycling practices."

The accurate transcription and identification of diverse numeral entities, encompassing both compound numerical expressions and standardized special codes, present significant challenges within natural language processing, particularly for morphologically rich languages such as Romanian. This paper introduces a robust hybrid system engineered to address these complexities by combining advanced artificial intelligence techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Large Language Models (LLMs), with meticulously crafted rule-based methods. The proposed system architecture is detailed, emphasizing its novel pipeline designed for processing numeral entities in Romanian text. Key contributions include the integration of a Romanian-specific word-to-number conversion module, augmented by an LLM-based fallback mechanism for enhanced accuracy with complex expressions, and a comprehensive suite of validators for numerous Romanian and international standard codes, including but not limited to IBAN, ISBN, VIN and the Romanian personal identification number. The system demonstrates effectiveness in handling a wide array of numeral entities and is designed for practical, offline deployment.

    "abstract": "We present recent results in the research and development of forevacuum plasma-cathode electron sources (FPESs) based on a cathodic arc, which generate pulsed largeradius electron beams at pressure of $\\mathbf{3}-\\mathbf{3 0 ~ P a}\\left(\\mathrm{Ar}, \\mathrm{N}_{2}, \\mathrm{O}_{2}, \\mathrm{He}\\right)$. We have used two types of the cathodic arc to generate emission plasma: 1 - an arc discharge with “open” cathode spots; 2 - a constricted arc discharge (CAD), in which emission plasma is shielded from the cathode spots by an intermediate electrode with a constricting channel. An increase in efficiency of electron emission (i.e. an increase in electron beam current at invariable arc current) is observed with an increase in gas pressure. The use of Ar ensures the higher emission efficiency, and the use of He leads to lower emission efficiency. At gas pressure below threshold pressure (for $\\mathrm{Ar}, \\mathrm{N}_{2}, \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ below 7 Pa; for He below 25 Pa), increasing the arc current leads to an increase in the electron emission efficiency, but at higher pressure the emission efficiency decreases as the discharge current increases. During generation of an e-beam, a decrease in the discharge voltage and an increase in maximum discharge current and pulse duration of the CAD are observed. These features are caused by “backstreaming” ion flux from beam plasma, which is formed due to electron impact ionization of gas. In the FPES based on the CAD, some delay in the appearance of emission current is observed, and delay time decreases with rising gas pressure and with increasing length of an accelerating gap (AG). The decrease in the delay time is due to a “parasitic” high-voltage glow discharge, which appears in the AG when accelerating voltage is applied. The developed FPESs provide to generate low-energy (up to $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ k e V}$), pulsed (from $\\mathbf{5 0} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ s to $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ m s}$), large-radius (up to $\\mathbf{4 5 ~ m m}$) electron beams with emission current up to $\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ A}$ at gas pressure of $\\mathbf{3}-\\mathbf{3 0 ~ P a}$. The achieved parameters allow using the FPESs for treatment of various materials, in particular, ceramics and glasses."

MITICA (Megavolt ITER Injector & Concept Advancement) is the full-scale prototype of the ITER Heating Neutral Beams (HNBs), devoted to test and optimize the HNB design, under construction in Padova at the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF) hosted by the Consorzio RFX. Recent experiments on High Voltage Bushing for MITICA and reduced-scale models at QST lab in Naka, Ibaraki, Japan, indicate that the HNB insulation might be critical. As a risk mitigation strategy for MITICA/HNB operation, a dedicated high-voltage test campaign has been initiated at the MITICA test bed at NBTF at the end of 2023. In this campaign, full-scale “mock-up electrodes,” reproducing almost faithfully the outer geometry of MITICA, are employed to test and optimize the electrostatic design of the MITICA/ITER HNBs as well as to identify suitable procedures for high voltage conditioning of the electrodes. This paper describes the progress in the experimental campaign, shows the main experimental results and provides some lessons learned regarding the operation of such large multipotential vacuum insulated electrostatic system."

    "abstract": "Mathematical applets have become essential tools in the teaching and learning of mathematics, offering interactive and dynamic representations of mathematical concepts. For students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), however, these applets must be designed to address their specific cognitive and learning needs to be truly effective. Despite increased efforts to support students with ASD in digital learning environments, no validated set of guidelines exist for designing mathematical applets tailored to these students. This study fills this gap by developing and validating a set of guidelines, operationalized for dynamic mathematical environments such as GeoGebra. In particular, the study advances beyond prior work by following a rigorous three-phase validation methodology involving two rounds of expert review with quantitative agreement analysis, and by explicitly grounding each guideline in the cognitive traits characteristic of ASD and their documented impact on mathematical learning. The multi-phase process starts with a literature review that incorporates cognitive traits of ASD, their impact on mathematical learning, and interface design principles. The guidelines are then refined through two rounds of expert validation, first by specialists in ASD and mathematics education, then by experts in GeoGebra applet development. Expert feedback is systematically integrated, ensuring both theoretical soundness and practical feasibility. The final guidelines provide a structured approach for designing mathematical applets tailored to the needs of students with ASD, while also serving as a foundation for further research in this field."

    "abstract": "In next generation intelligent networks, security analytics increasingly span feature-partitioned data silos and cross-organizational boundaries, thereby elevating compliance with the “right to be forgotten” to a first-order design requirement while maintaining noncentralized data governance. Vertical Federated Unlearning (VFU) has emerged as a promising solution to “the right to be forgotten” of Vertical Federated Learning, which allows participants to erase their data from global models without compromising model performance in Vertical Federated Learning. However, most VFU schemes are either tailored to shallow models or support only limited unlearning levels. Only a few VFU schemes are applicable to neural network architectures and support the three levels of unlearning requests, but they either suffer from suboptimal post-unlearning accuracy or incur significant storage overhead. In this paper, we propose LVFUS, a lightweight VFU framework that supports arbitrary model architectures and handles all three levels of unlearning requests with minimal resource overhead and high post-unlearning accuracy. Extensive experiments show that LVFUS outperforms the state-of-the-art, accelerating recovery time by 1.08x - 4.68x and improving model accuracy by 0.64% - 15.00%, with the storage overhead remaining at a constant level."

As healthcare systems evolve into complex socio-technical environments, integrating explainable AI with human-centered design is essential to improve transparency, trust, and adoption. In this study, we propose a multimodal human-centered deep learning framework (MDLHC) to support breast cancer diagnosis by integrating patient data, imaging, and explainable attribution (XAI) methods. The framework is designed with the social and cognitive needs of elderly patients and clinicians in mind and uses demographic data and mammography images for personalized diagnostics. To bridge structured and unstructured data, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) for natural language alignment and summarization of clinical insights. For improved image understanding, a CNN-based residual integrated attention (RIAC) module is applied for noise reduction, followed by optimized feature selection using evolutionary PSO with Laplacian centrality (EPSO-LC). Classification is performed via a deep backpropagation CNN (DL-BP-CNN), enhanced with two explainability modules: ensemble random SHAP (ERS) and submodular selection-based LIME (SMS-LIME) for both localized and global transparency. This framework contributes to the development of a transparent, accurate, and personalized AI system that aligns with the scope of computational social systems in healthcare care, particularly for aging populations that require reliable diagnostic support."

Co-GenT addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive learning’s sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while reducing generative methods’ dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements, with up to 59.2& and 14.27& F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the CoGenT preserves high accuracy while acquiring structural reliability. These findings establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in time series analysis.

With the rise of deep learning, 3D fashion design has seen transformative advancements, automating traditionally labor-intensive processes and enabling intelligent, data-driven workflows. Recent studies have demonstrated promising progress in areas such as sewing pattern generation, reconstruction, and 3D garment modeling. However, to date, no systematic review has specifically examined the integration of deep learning with sewing pattern–driven 3D fashion design. This survey addresses that gap by providing the first comprehensive overview of the field. We propose a novel four-stage pipeline, including representation, generation, reconstruction, and editing, to categorize and analyze current research. Within this pipeline, we review core methodologies, including geometric encoding for pattern representation, data-driven pattern generation, reconstruction from multimodal inputs (e.g., images, sketches, or text), and intuitive 3D garment editing techniques. We also consolidate existing benchmarks, covering both datasets and evaluation metrics, and contextualize the pattern-driven paradigm through comparison with alternative approaches in 2D and pattern-free 3D design. Finally, we identify key challenges, such as limited data availability and the difficulty of incorporating domain-specific design constraints, and outline future research directions to address these issues. By synthesizing current developments and structuring the research landscape, this survey serves as a foundational resource to support and accelerate innovation in manufacturable sewing pattern-driven 3D fashion design."

Moreover, such unsupervised methods only focus on spatial domain priors, lacking a comprehensive characterization of the spatial-spectral correlations inherent in HSIs. To tackle these limitations, we propose a robust deep recovery (RDR) model for HSI denoising with spatial-spectral total generalized variation (SSTGV) prior. Specifically, the truncated-Cauchy loss function is adopted to suppress the interference of outliers and enhance the robustness against sparse noise. Moreover, the SSTGV prior is integrated into the unsupervised RDR model, resulting in complementary effect of deep prior and handcraft prior. To solve the resulting optimization problem, an efficient ADMM algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach in both noise suppression and detail preservation, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for varied HSI denoising applications."

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation requires learning a generalizable policy that can adapt to complicated new environments. However, existing methods typically overlook the inherent task complexity and employ a policy with the same budget for tasks with varied difficulties, facing challenges in inefficient computational resource allocation and zero-shot generalization. In this work, we identify three facets of complexity imbalance issues in the current manipulation tasks at the Inter-task, Intra-task, and Noise-timesteps levels. To address this gap, we introduce the Complexity-Aware Policy (CAP), a novel approach integrating flow matching with a Transformer-based backbone and a Mixture of Heterogeneous Experts (MoHE) structure for policy learning. By leveraging Rectified Flow and dynamically adjusting model capacity based on task complexity, which is assessed through features like object counts and precision needs, our method allocates computational resources efficiently and effectively. This results in faster convergence, optimized computational resource usage, and improved precision across diverse manipulation tasks. Our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on widely-used CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv benchmarks, and is further validated through six real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms baseline methods across all tasks."

It presents a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) installation inside a 370MVA power electric generator using four transducers installed in the stator slots of an operating machine. This paper exploits the FBG sensor's capabilities of vibration sensing to analyze the synchronous generator (SG) mode of operation using attribute analysis and machine learning based solely on vibrational features. The method can distinguish between operation modes with the Fast Fourier Transform and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the measurements performed using FBGs. The algorithm identifies clusters using the K-means method based on attributes in sliding windows of the frequency domain. By comparing the results, it is possible to determine when the SG is connected to the electrical power system, delivering active power, and when the generator is operating as a synchronous compensator, generating reactive power. The main result is that the method described in this paper can differentiate the operating states of the generator based solely on the frequency domain, making it possible to filter and identify modes without temperature information. Additionally, the study of attributes using the Gini criterion provides a humanly understandable analysis of the classification decisions, offering a deep understanding of the physics of the generator."

The core contribution is the design of a jointly generated dynamic masking mechanism, which uses random numbers from both parties to obfuscate sensitive state data. This approach enhances the security of transmitted network data through increased randomness while eliminating the non-zero constraint of traditional privacy protection methods at the initial time. The piecewise mask function design ensures immediate recovery of genuine states post-initial masking, achieving precision control without privacy compromise. Additionally, the PTFT controller enables semi-global consensus within the prescribed time despite actuator faults, and ensures the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop systems. Finally, the algorithm simulation experiment verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and compares it with the traditional privacy protection method."

    "abstract": "With Petri nets, this paper aims to design a fast response and recovery strategy for abnormal situations where some of right-of-way (ROW) resources are not available due to accidents, thereby enhancing the resilience of unsignalized autonomous intersections. First, based on the analysis of vehicle trajectory characteristics at intersections, we extend the semantic types of places in classical Petri nets and propose the ROW resource Petri net (RRPN) for modeling fundamental autonomous intersections. Then, we introduce lane change transitions and establish a failure and recovery model for a failed ROW. With these two models, the RRPN with resource failure and recovery (RRPN-FR) model for autonomous intersections is built. Subsequently, based on the RRPN-FR model, we introduce maximal perfect resource transition circuit (MPC) and resource recovery circuit (RRC), and analyze the deadlocks caused by these two structures. Then, we introduce the notion of enhanced transition cover and design a resilient intersection control strategy based on the enhanced transition cover. It formally shows that this control strategy can enhance the resilience of a controlled intersection, effectively responding to unexpected situations and abnormal traffic conditions, which in turn prevents traffic congestion. Simulation experiments and comparative analysis further validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in the failure and recovery process and overall performance.

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of medical image segmentation under low contrast, ambiguous boundaries, and heterogeneous scales, we propose GOGNet, a gate-control-based adaptive fusion frame-work. GOGNet regulates the integration of primitive visual cues and contextual semantic representations according to the structural characteristics of the input image, thereby achieving robust segmentation across diverse conditions. The central module, termed the Gate Offset Generator (GOG), aggregates multi-level encoder features into a unified control vector that dynamically predicts offset weights to modulate skip connections and boundary extraction blocks. This mechanism enables context-aware fusion of structural and semantic information, followed by progressive reconstruction toward the target region through high-resolution refinement in the decoder pathway. Experimental evaluations on four public benchmark datasets — CVC-ClinicDB, 2018 Data Science Bowl, SegPC2021, and ISIC2018 — demonstrated that GOGNet consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods. It achieved mIoU scores of 90.4% (+7.4p), 83.2% (+3.1p), and 86.3% (+0.4p) on CVC-ClinicDB, SegPC2021, and the Data Science Bowl, respectively. On ISIC2018, GOGNet achieved 83.8% (+2.1p) for a single fold and an average of 83.0% (+2.9p) over 5-folds. Precision and Recall improved by +1.8 – 2.1p and +0.7 – 2.3p, respectively, indicating simultaneous enhancement in accuracy and stability. Ablation studies confirmed that the GOG module effectively suppressed feature redundancy and mitigated both under- and over-refinement, validating the effectiveness of the adaptive gating control mechanism in achieving optimal segmentation performance."

These models can be mapped to highly efficient commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) specialized hardware accelerators, whose reliability should be carefully evaluated before deployment. Unfortunately, given the large number of ML model architectures, possible configurations or input selections, and the numerous COTS accelerator architectures available, exhaustively testing every model-accelerator combination with beam experiments is unfeasible. Additionally, the radiation data obtained with a specific combination can hardly be extended to different configurations. In this paper, we test vision transformer (ViT) and segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN) models, in addition to several ML micro-benchmarks, on the Google Coral Edge TPU at 6 different radiation facilities, investigating particle-, software-, and hardware-dependent reliability behaviors. Our experimental results show that, while the cross section for radiation-induced silent data corruption (SDCs) can be up to 8 orders-of-magnitude higher when testing with high-LET heavy ions compared to atmospheric neutrons, the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">characteristics</i> of the SDCs are similar across all types of radiation tested.

    "abstract": "Bistable grasping devices exhibit high maneuverability and rapid responsiveness; however, existing bistable grippers often lack the capability for active adjustment of triggering forces and effective interaction with the environment during grasping. Inspired by the zebra mantis shrimp, this article proposes a bistable, multimode, and adaptive gripper named bistable multimode adaptive gripper (BMA) gripper. Through a bioinspired design of a multimode bistable actuator and underactuated fingers with modular fingertips, the proposed gripper achieves rapid grasping across diverse scenarios. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and functionality of the BMA gripper. Experimental results demonstrate that the gripper can operate in three distinct grasping modes: fully active, active bistable, and passive bistable grasping, effectively interacting with the environment to achieve adaptive grasping. In the bistable grasping mode, the gripper requires a minimal energy of only 0.412 mJ for state transition and can switch from the open state to the closed state in as short as 0.116 s. In addition, the gripper achieves a maximum gripping force of 68.4 N at a gripping distance of 120 mm. These results confirm the significant potential of the BMA gripper for high-speed adaptive grasping tasks in various application scenarios."

    "abstract": "Many-objective optimization (MaO) can be found in many areas. Most current MaO methods aim to approximate the Pareto set or find a single trade-off solution. They could become infeasible when the number of objectives is large. Some recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency of using a few solutions to synergistically optimize many objectives. This paper further refines and extends this idea for MaO. Specifically, we formulate this idea as a conditional set-optimization problem, termed the few-for-many (F4M) problem. Its optimization objective, referred to as the synergistic optimization index (SOI), is compatible with any user-specified scalarization method, enabling this formulation to flexibly model diverse MaO scenarios. Then, we introduce two specific forms of SOI: linear SOI and Tchebycheff SOI, followed by a theoretical analysis of their optimization complexity, monotonicity, and supermodularity. To apply the F4M formulation to MaO, we develop a greedy estimation-of-distribution algorithm (GEDA) and further design a generic multi-objective test suite (GMOTS). Extensive experimental studies illustrate the ability of GEDA in solving both continuous and discrete MaO problems."

    "abstract": "Motor imitation impairments are commonly reported in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs), suggesting that motor imitation could be used as a phenotype for addressing autism heterogeneity. Traditional methods for assessing motor imitation are subjective and labor-intensive, and require extensive human training. Modern Computerized Assessment of Motor Imitation (CAMI) methods, such as CAMI-3D for motion capture data and CAMI-2D for video data, are less subjective. However, they rely on labor-intensive data normalization and cleaning techniques, and human annotations for algorithm training. To address these challenges, we propose CAMI-2DNet, a scalable and interpretable deep learning-based approach to motor imitation assessment in video data, which eliminates the need for ad hoc normalization, cleaning and annotation. CAMI-2DNet uses an encoder-decoder architecture to map a video to a motion representation that is disentangled from nuisance factors such as body shape and camera views. To learn a disentangled representation, we employ synthetic data generated by motion retargeting of virtual characters through the reshuffling of motion, body shape, and camera views, as well as real participant data. To automatically assess how well an individual imitates an actor, we compute a similarity score between their motion encodings, and use it to discriminate individuals with ASCs from neurotypical (NT) individuals. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that CAMI-2DNet has a strong correlation with human scores while outperforming CAMI-2D in discriminating ASC vs NT children. Moreover, CAMI-2DNet performs comparably to CAMI-3D while offering greater practicality by operating directly on video data and without the need for ad hoc normalization and human annotations."

    "abstract": "Anonymous communication networks have emerged as crucial tools for obfuscating communication pathways and concealing user identities. However, their practical deployment faces several critical challenges, including vulnerability to artificial intelligence-powered metadata analysis, difficulties in fitting decentralized architectures, and the lack of provable security guarantees. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel decentralized anonymous routing protocol that resists both traceability and traffic analysis. The proposed protocol is fully decentralized and eliminates reliance on the threshold model and trusted third-party setups, ensuring indistinguishable identity privacy. Different from traditional empirical or heuristic security analysis of anonymous networks, this paper rigorously proves indistinguishable identity privacy for users even in extremely adversarial environments. Furthermore, simulation results validate the protocol’s practical feasibility, demonstrating both security and efficiency. By enabling secure information exchange while preserving user privacy, the proposed protocol offers a provably secure solution for privacy-preserving communication in modern digital infrastructures."

    "abstract": "The complex interactions between flexible needles and tissues present significant challenges in predicting the needle shape during the puncture procedure. In particular, the accurate prediction of flexible needle shape during insertion into complex multilayer tissues, especially when measurement feedback involves non-Gaussian noise, remains an open problem. In this article, we develop a novel reinforcement learning-based active modeling scheme to predict the deflection of the robotic flexible needle. First, the active modeling scheme is constructed by deriving an extended Kalman filter under the maximum correntropy criterion to enhance insensitivity to non-Gaussian noise. Subsequently, based on this scheme, the reinforcement active modeling (RAM) framework is built by incorporating reinforcement learning to compensate for the modeling residuals. Specifically, the theoretical convergence of the proposed scheme is proved by using the Banach fixed-point theorem, thereby ensuring the reliability of needle shape prediction. Finally, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on a self-built robotic flexible needle. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed deflection predictor. Under non-Gaussian noise conditions, the proposed RAM scheme achieves a generalization prediction error reduction of 46.4% in <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RMSE</b> and over 76.1% in <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Var</b> during insertion into unknown multilayer tissue."

    "abstract": "Boron oxide films were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering of a pure boron target in an oxygen atmosphere. The use of a pure boron target in conventional DC magnetron sputtering is difficult because under normal conditions boron has a high specific electrical resistance. This does not allow the magnetron discharge to operate at high values of current. The use of a thermally insulated boron target permitted to heat it to temperatures of $\\mathbf{4 5 0}-\\mathbf{7 5 0}{ }^{\\circ} \\mathbf{C}$ in the magnetron discharge and increase its electrical conductivity. As a result, we implemented a DC magnetron discharge in an argon atmosphere with current values of up to 300 mA. However, the use of oxygen as the operating gas often causes transitions of a glow magnetron discharge into arc mode, which disrupts the stable operation of the magnetron. To prevent arcing, a separate admission of the buffer argon to the magnetron and oxygen to the coating deposition area were implemented. This approach was employed to deposit boron oxide and suboxide coatings. The characteristics of the magnetron and properties of produced coatings are discussed."

Two other utterances of the same sentences were synthesized by using Google Translate and their F0 contours are also presented in the paper by assigning them to two possible cognitive descriptions. The aim of the paper is to conclude in what extent the synthesized intonations without cognitive modelling support the syntactic and semantic functions of constituents, and to show how cognitive descriptions can drive speech synthesis to adapt the intonation to the message of input sentences."

Comprehensive text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal, is performed to standardize the data. Exploratory text analyses, namely word cloud visualization and sentiment scoring, reveal distinct lexical and emotional patterns between CG and OR reviews, with CG content displaying more constrained vocabulary and sentiment range. Multiple ML algorithms, including decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are systematically implemented and rigorously compared, with a primary focus on maximizing the recall metric for the CG class, in order to minimize the risk of undetected CG reviews. Results indicate that ANN models employing rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation achieve the highest recall, substantially reducing false negatives (FN) and enhancing the reliability of CG reviews detection. Feature analysis further highlights the importance of both lexical and sentiment-based attributes in differentiating review types. These findings underscore the practical effectiveness and computational efficiency of tailored ML approaches in safeguarding online review authenticity, supporting real-time deployment with low operational cost."

    "abstract": "Predictive modeling for cardiovascular disease faces challenges, as traditional machine learning (ML) models often miss semantic details in clinical data, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) lack clinical reliability. This study evaluates a hybrid approach to address this, integrating a risk score generated by an LLM as an augmented feature into an XGBoost model. This method combines the semantic processing of LLMs with the predictive robustness of established ML algorithms. The hybrid model demonstrated a significantly higher F1-score (0.898) compared to the standalone XGBoost model (0.853). Further analyses confirmed this enhancement was attributable to the incremental information from the LLM feature, which SHAP analysis identified as the single most impactful predictor. The method's general applicability was also shown, improving performance for 13 out of 14 tested machine learning algorithms. This work presents a practical strategy for leveraging LLMs as feature extractors to effectively and reliably enhance clinical prediction models."

    "abstract": "In continuum robotics, real-time robust shape estimation is crucial for planning and control tasks that involve physical manipulation in complex environments. In this paper, we present a novel stochastic observer-based shape estimation framework designed specifically for continuum robots. The shape state space is uniquely represented by the modal coefficients of a polynomial, enabled by leveraging polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) to describe the curvature distribution along the arclength. Our framework processes noisy measurements from limited discrete position, orientation, or pose sensors to estimate the shape state robustly. We derive a novel noise-weighted observability matrix, providing a detailed assessment of observability variations under diverse sensor configurations. To overcome the limitations of a single model, our observer employs the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) method, coupled with Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs), to mix polynomial curvature models of different orders. The IMM approach, rooted in Markov processes, effectively manages multiple model scenarios by dynamically adapting to different polynomial orders based on real-time model probabilities. This adaptability is key to ensuring robust shape estimation of the robot's behaviors under various conditions. Our comprehensive analysis, supported by both simulation studies and experimental validations, confirms the robustness and accuracy of our methods."

The proposed design features a four-way time-interleaved charge-based subranging ADC that integrates three key techniques: 1) a wide input-tolerant charge-based comparator that extends the limited input range and improves operational robustness of conventional low-power charge-based comparators, 2) a conditional-branching-based partial activation scheme that improves the area and capacitive efficiency of the subranging architecture, and 3) a time-based calibration technique that addresses potential performance degradation in the conditional branching scheme. These design techniques enable robust and power-efficient ADC operation optimized for high-speed applications while minimizing the interleaving factor. The prototype ADC achieves an SNDR of 29.1 dB (ENOB = 4.54 bits) at 4 GHz input and 8 GS/s. Operating at 20 Gb/s under a 33.1 dB insertion loss channel, the proposed receiver effectively compensates for ISI, achieving a pre-FEC BER of 1.8E-8 with a competitive energy efficiency of 3.09 pJ/b. These results demonstrate that the proposed low-interleaving architecture provides a scalable and power-efficient solution for high-speed wireline communication."

    "abstract": "Pruning neural networks presents a promising avenue for compressing and accelerating contemporary deep convolutional networks. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused on a new kind of stripe-wise pruning (SWP) methods, which offers finer granularity compared to traditional techniques. However, most prior network pruning methods, including SWP, suffer from the issue of “wrong pruning.” During model training, particularly in its early stages, pruning decisions are often sub-optimal, leading to the premature elimination of crucial weights. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel framework that re-utilizes knowledge from pruned stripe-wise weights for SWP. The unique stripe repair phases are inserted into the standard training process to identify and repair those mis-pruned stripes. Additionally, halfway-pruned models with varying structures are also selectively reused a self-knowledge distillation manner. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The code will be released subsequently."

    "abstract": "Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are used in applications such as quantum communication, LiDAR, low-light imaging, and biosensing. However, conventional CMOS SPADs face a fundamental trade-off: passive quenching results in long RC recovery times, while active quenching leads to a reduced fill factor and increased complexity. We presented a self-quenched SPAD with an active self-recovery mechanism that can substantially accelerate the self-recovery process following self-quenching, making it a self-quenched, actively recovered (SQUARE) SPAD. Fabricated in a standard CMOS process, the SQUARE detector integrates a carbon-incorporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer above a crystalline silicon p/n junction, attaining Geiger-mode gains exceeding 105 with self-recovery below 30 ns. In comparison, the self-quenched, passively recovered SPAD of a similar structure but using a defected a-Si shows the same Geiger-mode gain but a self-recovery time of >1μs. The result demonstrates 50 times faster active recovery due to the gain of a-Si layer during the recovery cycle. To facilitate adoption of the device in applications using commercial CMOS process, we developed a theoretical framework and a Verilog-A circuit model that accurately capture avalanche dynamics and practical foundry constraints. Single-photon imaging demonstrations under low-light conditions confirm the advantage of enhanced speed and sensitivity of the SQUARE detector, positioning it as a scalable, cost-effective solution for single-photon imaging and sensing applications."

    "abstract": "In Industry 4.0 systems, numerous resource-constrained Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices frequently exchange data for model training, raising serious security and privacy concerns. To address these issues, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) and blockchain-assisted federated learning (FL) framework. In the proposed scheme, fog devices with sufficient computational resources generate DTs for edge devices to support local model training. We formulate an FL delay minimization problem that considers both model transmission and synchronization delays while introducing cooperative jamming to secure DT synchronization. To solve this non-convex problem, a decomposition-based optimization algorithm is developed. By introducing upper bounds on local training delay and jamming effects as auxiliary variables, the problem is transformed into a convex form that can be efficiently decomposed and solved. Furthermore, a blockchain-based verification mechanism and a validator selection algorithm are designed to ensure model integrity and participant authentication during the FL process, thereby enhancing blockchain scalability. The final global model is obtained by aggregating verified local updates through deep learning techniques. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative interference-based DT–blockchain-assisted FL framework outperforms benchmark schemes in execution time, block efficiency, and model accuracy."

While DSRC and C-V2X technologies have standardised physical layer communication, the upper layers remain flexible and open to diverse implementations. Existing IoT application layer protocols (ALPs), built on legacy TCP and UDP transport protocols, may exhibit suboptimal performance in dynamic V2I environments. This study evaluates six ALPs, i.e., AMQP, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, WebSocket (WS), and XMPP, across twenty protocol combinations, including modern QUIC and SCTP transport protocols. Using a simulation framework that integrates Omnet++, SUMO, Veins, and OpenStreetMap data, we assess key performance metrics: latency, packet delivery ratio, throughput, inter-arrival time, and connection establishment time. Our results indicate that while most protocol combinations perform adequately under low node densities (e.g., fewer than 100 nodes), network congestion leads to performance degradation. Nevertheless, CoAP over QUIC/UDP and WS over QUIC emerge as promising candidates for disseminating awareness messages across diverse V2I communication scenarios within the context and test limits."

It incorporates a 2-channel analog dither input that is designed for Mach–Zehnder modulator auto-bias control. A novel R-string layout and a two-stage switching sequence are implemented to achieve high-resolution and calibration-free operation with common poly resistors rather than thin-film resistors. The second stage DAC-embedded amplifier adopts a proposed adaptive bias to maintain an almost constant Vds for the input differential pairs, resulting in higher linearity when operating in a high-voltage domain. The measured integral non-linearity (INL) is <12 least significant bit (LSB) and the differential non-linearity (DNL) is <3 LSB as the temperature shifts from −40°C to 125°C, respectively. The zero-output noise is below 250 μVpp, corresponding to a root mean square noise of less than 37 μVrms. The mean zero-output voltage changes from −800 μV to 0 V as the temperature increases from −40°C to 125°C. The gain error across 16 channels is below 0.25% FS, and the setup time is less than 16 μs with a load capacitance of up to 1 nF. The K error is nearly 0, when the proposed auto-bias control is locked. And the output optical power varies by only 0.02 dBm in 40 min with the proposed auto-bias control."

By employing the proposed impedance tracking method and a feedforward compensation, the proposed methodology effectively mitigates reactive power sharing errors caused by line impedance voltage drops. The control method is specifically designed for multiple GFM inverters with varying line impedances that are not directly connected to the point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed droop controller automatically estimates line impedances and compensates for voltage drop components in the DQ coordinate system, thereby nullifying the influence of line impedances as observed at the output terminals of the GFM inverters. Unlike traditional methods that rely on direct ac voltage application, the proposed approach utilizes DQ synchronous coordinate transformation to ensure stable and accurate reactive power sharing for multiple GFM inverters under both grid-connected and stand-alone conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been validated through simulations and experiments conducted on a 5 kVA prototype, demonstrating its capability to achieve precise reactive power sharing under varying operating conditions."

    "abstract": "A quantitatively analysis of the impact of process induced dislocations on minority carrier lifetime in 300-mm Si wafer was presented. High thermal budget processes, such as oxidation and impurity diffusion, are essential in Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) fabrication but can induce dislocations in large-diameter Si wafers. These dislocations may degrade the minority carrier lifetime, directly impairing device performance. Therefore, establishing a quantitative relationship between dislocation density and lifetime is crucial for process control and yield improvement. In this paper, we first demonstrate that dislocation propagation during thermal processes can be effectively suppressed by controlling the magnitude of a parameter “f”, which represents the dislocation propagation rate. Subsequently, wafers with varying dislocation density were fabricated through a series of consecutive thermal cycles. The dislocation density was determined by numerical calculation, while the corresponding minority carrier lifetime was measured using the micro-photoconductivity decay (l-PCD) method. A quantitative correlation between dislocation density and lifetime was established. These findings contribute to preventing dislocation-induced lifetime degradation during high thermal budget process in power device manufacturing."

Previous studies on TVS have primarily focused on trigger delay time; however, there has been little attention paid to the vacuum arc plasma diffusion process in TVS, despite its influence on the pulse current rising characteristics of the switch. The plasma diffusion processes in TVS are addressed in this paper using PIC-MCC simulation, along with their effects on current rise in TVS. The influences of electric and magnetic field distributions in the contact gap, as well as its length, on plasma diffusion are analyzed. The results indicate that the electric field in the contact gap significantly affects the speed of arc ignition and plasma diffusion, while higher electric field strengths accelerate the formation of stronger arc channels through faster plasma diffusion. The arc diffusion path and its stability are also influenced by the magnetic field distribution in the vacuum contact gap, primarily affecting the current rise rate. Furthermore, a shorter gap distance promotes the formation and development of vacuum arc channels, leading to a faster current rising process. Based on the simulations presented in this paper, suggestions for designing electrode structures in TVS are provided, offering a basis for developing vacuum switches with improved performance."

    "abstract": "It is reported that penetrating destruction of solid insulator for vacuum interrupter (VI) occurred during ac voltage conditioning. We suppose that the formation of charging on the solid alumina insulator by the ac voltage application affects the penetrating destruction of the alumina. In this paper, in order to find the cause of the penetrating destruction in VI, we obtained the charging potential distribution on the alumina surface and investigated the effect of charging on the alumina surface on the field distortion inside alumina and the penetrating destruction in vacuum. We confirmed that positive charging was formed on the alumina surface due to the secondary electron emission before the occurrence of flashover on the alumina surface. On the other hand, it is considered that the alumina surface experiences the removal of charging due to flashover and the reformation of charging, repetitively, during the ac voltage conditioning process of VI, where the reformation of charging may induce the penetrating destruction. By applying higher voltage after flashovers on the alumina surface, we found that a positive charging was formed on the entire alumina surface, whereas a negative charging exceeding 20 kV was formed locally because high energy electrons collided with the alumina surface under the electrode. By the electric field analysis considering the charging potential distribution on the alumina surface, we confirmed that, as the result of the locally accumulated negative charging on the alumina surface, the electric field was distorted when the charging was saturated. The negative charging on the alumina surface can enhance the electric field strength in the direction of the alumina thickness, and the maximum electric field strength can be close to the dielectric strength of the alumina. This implies that the negative charging formed by the high voltage application distorts and enhances the electric field inside alumina leading to the penetrating destruction."

The tests were performed at several tens of kilovolts across millimeter-scale gaps. The findings reveal a phenomenology similar to that observed in Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) and Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) structures, which incorporate a thin dielectric layer between electrodes, particularly in terms of leakage current and breakdown behavior. This similarity underscores the crucial role of surface oxide layers in discharge processes for high DC voltage, large-gap configurations, such as those found in electron guns, X-ray tubes, and electrostatic accelerators for Neutral Beam Injectors in fusion experiments."

    "abstract": "During the lightning impulse test of the grounding system in the high-altitude ultra-high voltage test hall, the lightning current is dispersed from the grounding injection point to the surrounding ground through the grounding device. This is usually manifested as a local transient ground potential rise caused by the impact current acting on the grounding device, resulting in a ground potential rebound. This paper refers to the soil test data of Xizang and the grounding system diagram of the high altitude Ultra High Voltage test hall, and uses the ground potential simulation model to simulate the characteristics of the lightning impulse test counterattack ground potential under the hall grounding model, and obtains the influence relationship between the ground potential distribution and the injection point location, the distribution of grounding system branches, and proposes reasonable optimization measures for the grounding system to prevent the ground potential counterattack during the impulse test."

    "abstract": "Cathode spot formation, which drives contact erosion in vacuum circuit breakers, is experimentally observed through the appearance of cathode craters accompanied by surface atom emission and droplet ejection. To mitigate erosion, material modifications have been explored to flatten crater morphology and reduce particle emission. Building on conventional $\\mathbf{C u} / \\mathbf{C r}$ contacts, additions such as graphene have been tested experimentally, showing promising improvements in erosion resistance. To investigate the role of different material components and additives in cathode crater formation, this work employs two-dimensional Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to capture the transient process of crater evolution. Compared to 3D MD models, 2D simulations enable larger spatial domains, allowing more realistic modelling of material modifications at scales of $\\mathbf{1 0 0 ~ n m} \\sim \\mathbf{1} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}$. In this study, localized cathode surfaces composed of Cu and $\\mathrm{Cu} / \\mathrm{Cr}$ with various Cr distribution are simulated under identical external conditions. The results reveal distinct behaviours in surface deformation, atom emission, and droplet detachment for each material design. Key material properties-including melting point, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and viscosity-collectively influence the thermal response and molten pool stability, thereby governing crater formation. The simulations demonstrate that advanced material designs can suppress surface instability, resulting in flatter and shallower craters. This contributes to enhanced erosion resistance, offering valuable insights for optimizing contact materials in vacuum circuit breakers."

Previous work showed that VPKL can be performed with a visually grounded speech model trained on paired images and unlabelled speech. But all experiments were done on English. Moreover, transcriptions were used to get positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. This paper introduces a few-shot learning scheme to mine pairs automatically without transcriptions. On English, this results in only a small drop in performance. We also – for the first time – consider VPKL on a real low-resource language, Yorùbá. While scores are reasonable, here we see a bigger drop in performance compared to using ground truth pairs because the mining is less accurate in Yorùbá."

The methodology is presented step by step with illustrative examples. A key element is a simulation network model that replicates circuit responses. Simulations under both short-circuit and open-circuit conditions are used to identify all circuit elements and assess their parasitic behaviours. This enables effective filtering of the circuit response current from the measured breaking current, yielding an accurate analysis of the pure post-arc current and facilitating comparisons across different interruption scenarios. Various parameters, such as contact gap, current magnitude, and voltage gradient can be examined to evaluate their effect on performance. Furthermore, the methodology is adaptable to specific requirements, including DC applications, where very high short-circuit current gradients pose additional challenges. AC investigations at higher voltage levels are also of particular interest, since they involve significantly greater voltage-gradient stresses."

    "abstract": "Industry associations play a pivotal role in National Innovation Systems (NIS) in emerging economies. As institutional intermediaries, they provide firms with resources and information while also imposing administrative interventions that can reduce efficiency and undermine the interests of smaller firms. Consequently, the impact of these associations on firm innovation remains ambiguous. Drawing on the strategic tripod perspective, this study investigates how industry associations influence firm innovation contingent upon firm resource endowments and industry conditions. Using a nationally representative sample of Chinese SMEs from the China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey, we estimate logistic regression models to examine how association membership shapes firms' patenting outcomes. Our results provide rigorous empirical evidence that industry associations are not neutral but embody an “elite-capture” bias by prioritizing firms with strong technological resources and close political ties. Moreover, although industry associations generally promote firm innovation, this positive effect reverses in highly competitive environments, whereas high-tech industry affiliation amplifies the innovation benefits of membership. These findings remain robust after six robustness checks, including propensity score matching, the Heckman selection model, and control function methods. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of the dual role of industry associations in firm innovation from the strategic tripod perspective and highlights their conditional influence within NIS in emerging markets."

    "abstract": "2D X-ray radiography is a widely used medical imaging technique due to its low cost, rapid acquisition, and low radiation exposure. However, X-ray images are limited to the 2D plane, making it difficult for physicians to visualize and assess the 3D anatomical information. We present Pixel2Voxel, a method to reconstruct 3D volume from a limited number (1 or 2) of 2D X-ray images for the visualization of 3D anatomical structures. Our approach backprojects the local image features onto their corresponding voxels and aggregates the 2D features from the images to get the 3D geometry-aware volume features. To address the inherent ambiguity stemming from sparse input data, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model that seamlessly integrates with the 3D volume features. This integration significantly enhances our model's ability to generate high-fidelity and geometrically consistent 3D volumes. Furthermore, we propose an iterative refinement method that substantially improves the reconstruction quality. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments on real patient datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in 3D reconstruction compared to recent methods. Besides, we evaluate our method's capabilities in 3D organ shape reconstruction and volume measurement. Our promising results showcase its great potential across various medical applications, augmenting 2D X-rays by enabling assessment and visualization of 3D anatomical information, such as organ shape, size, and location, with lower cost and lower radiation exposure of X-rays."

    "abstract": "Weak targets on the sea surface are considered as significant detection problem because the weak echo signals are usually overwhelmed by strong sea clutter. Conventional adaptive coherent detection methods often exhibit high false alarm and miss detection rates. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a photonic-assisted weak target detection method, which combines an optical injection locking (OIL) receiver architecture with a Sea clutter Three level Mitigation for Ocean Targets (STMOT) algorithm. In this system, OIL enables the high-stability high-gain down-conversion of broadband linear frequency modulated signals to the intermediate frequency, which allows to significantly enhance the coherence of weak target signals. The STMOT algorithm employs a multi-stage progressive detection strategy, which effectively removes non-Gaussian sea clutter through long-time coherent integration and allows to perform stable tracking of weak targets. Experiments are then conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that, in multi-target scenarios, a receiver coherence gain of 3 dB is provided by the OIL operating in the period one state, allowing to stably and continuously detect the underlying trajectory for a period of 300 s. In addition, the proposed OIL-STMOT method increases the average number of consecutive frames in a track by more than 40%. For echo signals having a signal-to-noise ratio of –18 dB under lognormal sea clutter, it achieves a detection probability of 80% at a false alarm probability of 10⁻⁴. Moreover, the system enables continuous trajectory monitoring under strong clutter interference. Furthermore, it can monitor slow small targets on the sea surface, which highlights its high efficiency in coastal surveillance radar applications."

    "abstract": "The emergence and expansion of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) paradigms have transformed cloud provisioning methodologies, while simultaneously introducing complex security smells. Traditional detectors are unable to handle the semantic challenges (i.e., understanding the meaning and context of code beyond its syntax) introduced by contemporary IaC ecosystems due to their reliance on heuristic rules and syntactic patterns. This work introduces SecLLM, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reconceptualize the detection of security smells through contextual semantic analysis. Our approach avoids conventional intermediate representations, exploiting natural language understanding to examine Ansible, Puppet, and Chef configurations through adaptive prompt engineering methodologies. The framework architecture supports multiple IaC infrastructures and LLMs while simultaneously enabling optimization of the underlying LLM responses for each of the nine security smell analyzed. Furthermore, SecLLM provides detailed feedback regarding the analyzed scripts that can help practitioners define their infrastructure’s risk profile and resolve the identified smells. The empirical validation demonstrates that SecLLM outperforms GLITCH, a state-of-the-art security smell identification tool, achieving precision improvements of 12-21 percentage points and F1-score gains of 17-32 percentage points in terms of detection accuracy while simultaneously maintaining low operational costs ($0.003-$0.015 per script). Additionally, we address the non-deterministic behavior inherent to LLMs through three mitigation strategies (confidence-based filtering, ensemble voting, and response caching) that achieve perfect reproducibility (Fleiss’ k = 1.00) and preserve detection accuracy."

By employing two ETMs, optionally with different specifications and real-time load distribution, the research evaluates the impact on energy savings and battery longevity. The analysis is based on a comparative simulation study between single and dual ETM configurations, emphasizing energy consumption and environmental impact from both design and control perspectives. Simulation results for the Borlänge–Malung railway corridor in Sweden indicate that energy consumption can be reduced by approximately 15–20%, depending on the torque-sharing strategy and size ratio between the ETMs. The study further illustrates the operational inefficiencies inherent in single-ETM systems and highlights the performance gains of dynamic torque splitting in dual-ETM configurations. A specific control strategy is proposed: the smaller ETM is prioritized during cruising, while both machines are utilized under high-power demands such as acceleration. This approach optimizes energy usage without compromising performance, contributing to a more sustainable and cost-effective regional rail system. In terms of environmental impact, simulations based on the Swedish electricity mix show that the dual-ETM setup can reduce operational CO₂ emissions by approximately 80 tons over a 40-year service life. Moreover, improved battery utilization extends battery life, reducing manufacturing-related CO₂ emissions by an estimated 15 tons compared to the single-ETM configuration."

    "abstract": "The use of large language models (LLMs) for generating code in software development is on the rise. While LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities, there remains a need to evaluate the quality of generated code beyond functional correctness. This paper addresses a gap in current research by evaluating Python code generated by nine state-of-the-art LLMs according to the four main code quality categories (maintainability, reliability, performance efficiency, and security) defined by the ISO/IEC 5055:2021 standard. The evaluation spans three popular application domains (high-performance computing, machine learning, and data processing). It employs a stratified prompting approach with varying levels (short, medium, and long) of detail. Using widely adopted static code analysis tools, the study identifies which LLMs perform best across these categories. The analysis involved selecting nine algorithms across three application domains, and the generated code was compared against a human developer using four static code analysis tools. Metrics were organized into the four ISO 5055 categories, and composite scores were calculated for each category following preprocessing to ensure accurate evaluation. The results showed that GPT-4-Turbo produced the most reliable, performance-efficient, and secure code, while Gemini excelled in generating maintainable Python code among the evaluated models. The study concludes that properly prompted and configured LLMs can produce code that meets or even exceeds human-developed code in terms of the four ISO categories. Future work will continue to refine and expand upon these methodologies on other programming languages."

    "abstract": "Recent approaches attempt to adapt powerful interactive segmentation models, such as SAM, to interactive matting and fine-tune the models based on synthetic matting datasets. However, models trained on synthetic data fail to generalize to complex and occlusion scenes. We address this challenge by proposing a new matting dataset based on the COCO dataset, namely COCO-Matting. It selects real-world complex images from COCO and converts semantic segmentation masks to matting labels. The built COCO-Matting comprises an extensive collection of 36,980 human instance-level alpha mattes in complex natural scenarios. Furthermore, existing SAM-based matting methods extract intermediate features and masks from a frozen SAM and only train a lightweight matting decoder by end-to-end matting losses, which do not fully exploit the potential of the pre-trained SAM. Thus, we propose SEMat which revamps the network architecture and training objectives. For network architecture, the proposed feature-aligned transformer learns to extract fine-grained edge and transparency features. The proposed matte-aligned decoder aims to segment matting-specific objects and convert coarse masks into high-precision mattes. For training objectives, the proposed regularization and trimap loss aim to retain the prior from the pre-trained model and push the matting logits extracted from the mask decoder to contain trimap-based semantic information. Extensive experiments across seven diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, proving its efficacy in interactive natural image matting.

    "abstract": "Depression detection using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals obtained from wearable medical-assisted diagnostic systems has become a well-established approach in the field of affective disorders. However, despite recent advancements, on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) models still demand substantial computational resources, presenting significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained wearable medical devices. Embedded Multi-core Processors (MPs) offer a promising solution for accelerating these models. However, the limited computational capabilities of embedded MPs, combined with the structural diversity of AI models, complicate resource allocation and increase associated costs. To address these challenges, we propose a Memory-Aware Multi-Objective Iterative Local Search (MAMILS) algorithm to optimize task scheduling, thereby improving the efficiency of AI model deployment on wearable EEG devices. Experimental results across seven AI models demonstrate that, the MAMILS approach yields substantial improvements in key performance indicators: Total Energy Consumption (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {TEC}$</tex-math></inline-formula>) with an average reduction of 47.57%, <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {Makespan}$</tex-math></inline-formula> with an average reduction of 48.75%, and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bm {Throughput}$</tex-math></inline-formula> with an average increase of 198.37%, all while maintaining satisfactory classification performance for both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Especially, on-board deployment of EEGNeX achieves an accuracy of 93.4%, sensitivity of 91.6%, and specificity of 95.8%. Further analysis indicates that, when integrated with wearable EEG sensors and executable on-board AI models, the proposed MAMILS optimization strategy shows significant promise in facilitating the widespread adoption of low-power, real-time diagnostic systems for depression detection."

    "abstract": "With the latest advancements in drone control capabilities within warfare technologies, a new class of drones utilizing optical fiber line data transmission has emerged as an unresolved challenge in drone detection. Remote drone control using optical fiber line data transmission introduces a new level of covert drone operations by enabling a complete radio communication silence, thereby rendering traditional radiocommunication detection techniques ineffective. In the near future, artificial intelligence systems will likely enable fully autonomous flight control and navigation, eliminating the need for any detectable radio transmissions. This will further limit viable detection technologies, leaving only a few methods capable of identifying drones under complete radio silence conditions. One potential method for detecting drones involves analysing the electromagnetic radiation signatures of their thrust motors, which is the focus of this study. This article investigates the electromagnetic signature radiated by a drone's brushless electric thrust motor. Our experiments reveal the nature of electromagnetic radiation generated by the drone's thrust system, which is essential for its flight operation. The study analyses common commercially available drone propulsion system architectures, their motor control components, motor types, and sources of electromagnetic emissions in the very low frequency 3 kHz – 30 kHz and low frequency 30 kHz – 300 kHz range. In this research, two different types of brushless DC thrust motors are examined, highlighting their power current waveform dependencies, as well as their analysis and radiated spectrum comparison in different thrust power modes. As a result of the conducted research, it was established that the frequency spectrum signature of electromagnetic radiation caused by the thrust motors of drones is completely determined by the duty cycles of the pulse-width modulation of the supply currents and the frequency of switching the phases for the internal motor windings."

When the highvoltage power source is turned $\\mathbf{1 8 0}$ degrees, the lower part of the feedthrough insulator is located inside the rectifier sections. This allowed the accelerating potential to be supplied through the lower gas part of the feedthrough insulator to the high-voltage electrodes of the vacuum part of the accelerator directly from its sections. Which made it possible to create a uniform voltage distribution in the accelerating gaps of the tandem and eliminate the voltage drop in the gaps when dark currents appear. The changes made allowed to reduce the height of the facility, which is essential for placing the facility in a medical clinic.

A hybrid Maxwell-Boltzmann model is employed to self-consistently couple plasma physics with circuit simulation, overcoming the limitation of fixed transient recovery voltage assumptions in former simulation studies. The results reveal that residual charge at current zero modulates the charge absorption current at contacts, while supply voltage influences the electrical stress on plasma. Both factors affect the peaks of transient recovery voltage and post-arc current. The proposed coupled approach offers a computationally efficient framework for an in-depth understanding of the post-arc process of vacuum arcs."

    "abstract": "Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is an effective method for measuring crucial physical parameters in the vacuum arc, including electron temperature, electron density, and excited state atomic density. However, the presence of the absorption effect challenges the accurate identification of spectral information, potentially leading to measurement errors in these physical parameters. To overcome this limitation, we developed an absorption correction algorithm based on a collisional radiative model (CRM), using OES-derived electron temperature and density as inputs. The CRM was employed to compute the population distribution of copper atoms and the escape factor, which quantifies the absorption effect. Radiation intensities were then corrected using the Lambert-Beer law. The corrected results reveal that electron temperature ranges from 0.7 to 0.85 eV, with higher values near the anode. The excited state densities at 510.6 nm and 515.3 nm exhibit similar spatial trends, with greater densities in the near-anode region. Additionally, the escape factor is lower at 515.3 nm than at 510.6 nm and decreases with increasing distance from the cathode, indicating a stronger absorption effect toward the anode."

Connecting shunt grading capacitors balances voltage distribution across breaks and enhances breaking capacity. However, switching capacitor banks-especially back-to-back-induces high-frequency inrush currents and overvoltages. Phase-controlled closing technique mitigates transients from closing capacitive loads for smooth transitions, requiring accurate pre-strike characteristics (e.g., pre-strike gap, dispersion, voltage, electric field strength). Current research on pre-strike characteristics of DBVCBs with shunt grading capacitors is limited. This paper experimentally investigates pre-breakdown characteristics of DBVCBs after highfrequency impulse current ablation under power frequency voltage, comparing conditions with/without grading capacitors and resistive-capacitive voltage grading. Experiments use 500 $\\mathbf{p F}$ grading capacitors and $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ k} \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} / \\mathbf{5 0 ~ k} \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ resistors.

It proposes a Transformer-based risk monitoring model for anti-money laundering. The approach is grounded in transaction sequence modeling and integrates the structural information of transaction graphs. A context-aware classifier is introduced to enable accurate identification and risk scoring of high-risk accounts. The model first applies feature embedding and positional encoding to each transaction. It then uses multiple Transformer layers to capture long-range behavioral dependencies. At the same time, it incorporates account interaction information from the graph structure. This enhances the model's ability to detect abnormal transaction chains across accounts. At the output stage, a classifier that fuses sequential semantics with graph context is used to determine the overall money laundering risk of each account. Multiple experiments were conducted on the publicly available Elliptic dataset. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream models on evaluation metrics such as AUC, F1-Score, and Accuracy. It also demonstrates stronger discriminative power and greater stability in identifying high-risk accounts. Further analysis of model depth sensitivity and case-based verification supports the model's effectiveness in real-world complex transaction environments. The proposed method offers a more adaptable technical solution for financial institutions dealing with large-scale suspicious behavior detection tasks."

    "abstract": "Kinodynamic motion planning for a multi-robot system with different dynamics and actuation limits is a challenging problem. The difficulty increases with the presence of aerodynamic interaction forces that occur when aerial robots fly in close proximity. Due to these complexities, existing planners either rely on simplified assumptions (like ignoring robot dynamics and interaction forces) or produce highly suboptimal solutions. This paper presents a kinodynamic motion planner for a heterogeneous team of robots that respects robot dynamics, scales well to 16 robots, and directly reasons about interaction forces between aerial robots operating in close proximity. Our method, db-ECBS, generalizes the multi-agent path-finding method Enhanced Conflict-Based Search (ECBS) to the continuous domain by using the single-robot kinodynamic motion planner discontinuity-bounded A*. The planner db-ECBS operates on three levels. Initially, individual robot trajectories are computed using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter robot collisions or interaction force violations and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint-space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound, resulting in an anytime, probabilistically complete, and asymptotically bounded suboptimal planner. We provide a benchmark of 65 problems with six different dynamics. We demonstrate that db-ECBS produces trajectories that are less than half the cost of existing planners. We show that the interaction-awareness is particularly important for very dense scenarios."

This article proposes optimal analytical strategies for players based on the corresponding payoff functions, depending on the attacker’s position within different winning regions under various speed ratios. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of a unique optimal target point within the offensive advantage region. Unlike numerical methods, which are limited by computational complexity and real-time application capabilities, the proposed method allows for the precise calculation of barriers and real-time updates in nonpoint capture scenarios.

    "abstract": "Appearance-based gaze estimation still lacks generalizability due to anatomical and appearance differences at the human level. Their performance deteriorates significantly during cross-person evaluation and even more during cross-dataset evaluation. These drawbacks can be mitigated by employing subject-specific calibration data to personalize gaze estimation networks. Here, we present Adaptive Gaze Estimation with Extended Memorization (GEM), an adaptive gaze estimation framework. The core of GEM is a few-shot learning system and novel Extended Memorization. As a successful few-shot learner, GEM adapts to any previously unseen subject without overfitting, while Extended Memorization increases the efficacy and stability of the adaptation process. Crucially, GEM avoids the performance plateau seen in other methods; its accuracy improves consistently as calibration samples increase from 1 to 256. This allows it to compete with and quickly outperform prior deep-learning-only approaches with very few samples, and ultimately achieve state-of-the-art performance by continuing to improve as more calibration data is provided. GEM achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 2.32° on the MPIIFaceGaze dataset and 1.68° on the GazeCapture dataset during the cross-person evaluation."

    "abstract": "This article investigates friction welding (FW) between electrolytic tough pitch copper (Cu) and 304 stainless steel (SS) in a rod joint configuration with a 16 mm diameter, utilizing the continuous drive FW technique. This welding was conducted by varying friction pressure (FP) and upset pressure (UP), while other parameters remained constant. From the welding parameters, the “coefficient of friction” (COF) was estimated, which is found in the range of 0.18–0.40. The concept of the COF is widely applied in both science and engineering. The variation in COF during the FW process affected the torque, which ranged from 12.13 to 16.2 Nm, and the power, which varied between 2094 and 2902 W. Changes in COF, torque, and power were governed by the applied pressure, which, in turn, influenced the strength of the welded joints. Notably, higher COF values corresponded to significant improvements in the tensile strength of the joint. All samples fractured on the Cu side, away from the interface, with the maximum recorded tensile strength reaching 202 MPa."

    "abstract": "Biohybrid microrobots, which merge living biological matter with synthetic components, hold immense promise to revolutionize medicine by acting as targeted therapeutic agents. A fundamental barrier to their clinical translation, however, is their inherent biological heterogeneity—variations in size, morphology, and function—compounded by imperfections in actuation systems, resulting in unpredictable and unreliable motion. Here, we address this critical challenge by building a control framework that simultaneously compensates for both intrinsic robot-to-robot variability and extrinsic actuator nonlinearities. Our approach integrates real-time time-delay estimation to learn and cancel the unique, unmodeled dynamics of each individual microrobot, with a finite-time terminal sliding mode controller that ensures robust, high-fidelity trajectory tracking despite system imperfections. We demonstrate that this strategy standardizes the behavior of a heterogeneous population of cell-based microrobots (200–500 μm), reducing trajectory tracking errors by 51.3% compared to conventional controllers. By transforming these living constructs into reliable robotic agents, we enabled their precise deployment in a functional task, enhancing the closure rate of an in vitro tissue wound model by 77.8% . This work overcomes a crucial obstacle in biohybrid robotics, establishing a clear pathway toward harnessing the therapeutic potential of engineered living systems for applications in targeted drug delivery and regenerative medicine."

    "abstract": "The linear variable reluctance (VR) resolver as a contactless measurement component is essentially a small electric machine and presents a better reliability than other linear position sensors. For the high-density automated store shelves scenarios, the desired position sensor should have features of low-cost, small-size, high-precision, and easy-to-install on a several tens or even one hundred meters rail. The previously proposed linear resolvers for the long-distance application cannot well satisfy the above requirements. To address the issues, this article proposes a linear resolver system, which replaces the mover teeth and wire-wound winding with the printed circuit board (PCB) winding. This slotless structure is good for saving the manufacturing cost but induces a high flux leakage, which then causes a significant signal asymmetry. To suppress this longitudinal end asymmetry and its induced precision issue, this article investigates the PCB winding design. The additional auxiliary coils are added, and the complementary scheme is applied on the PCB. Experiments validate this extremely low-cost solution, which provides a less than 0.2 mm precision in a long rail."

Within this framework, new X-Ray pixel detectors are required to satisfy the challenging requirements from XFEL experiments, including high frame rates, wide dynamic range, and low noise for single-photon sensitivity. In particular, achieving single-photon resolution while maintaining a large dynamic range of up to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> photons presents substantial challenges in the design of the detector readout electronics. In this article, we present a novel front-end architecture based on a Charge Sensitive Amplifier (CSA) with predictive gain switching and a Flip-Capacitor filter. The CSA is designed for Silicon Pixel Detectors and aims to achieve both a single photon resolution and a high dynamic range up to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup> photons by employing an adaptive control of the gain. The novel predictive gain circuit dynamically sets the proper gain by measuring the time needed by the signal to exceed a fixed threshold. The gain is automatically adjusted by adding feedback capacitances in parallel. When the CSA is in its highest gain configuration, a filter is connected to reduce the electronic noise and achieve the single-photon resolution below 1 keV. The filter is based on the Flip-Capacitor Filter concept and implements a fast trapezoidal weighting function. To couple the CSA with the filter, a voltage-to-current converter has been designed. A first prototype of this front-end has been designed in 65 nm CMOS technology, and the design and simulations are presented here."

    "abstract": "Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has shown promising results in automating the design of deep learning models. However, its search process is computationally expensive because it evaluates all candidate operations simultaneously, often leading to an over-parameterized and inefficient search network. To reduce the computational cost, DARTS employs a smaller search network than the final evaluation network, which introduces an architecture optimization gap that limits real-world performance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CR-DARTS, a multi-stage search framework designed to bridge the architecture optimization gap through an adaptive channel redistribution strategy. CR-DARTS reduces the computational complexity of the search network by compressing the shared input features among candidate operations and restoring the network dimensions via channel-wise feature concatenation. In addition, it progressively eliminates underperforming operations and redistributes the number of channels for more relevant feature extraction, thereby narrowing the gap between the search and evaluation networks. We validated CR-DARTS on two diverse computer vision tasks to assess its generalizability. Experimental results show that the proposed search framework reduces the memory requirement of the DARTS algorithm by up to 4.3×, while addressing the architecture optimization gap. Moreover, in the evaluation phase, the discovered architecture achieves up to 25.3% reductions in computational complexity and 50.6% faster inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy. It also produces a competitive fire segmentation network that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that CR-DARTS is a practical solution for neural architecture search. Source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Realistic3D-MIUN/CR-DARTS."

This paper develops a game-theoretic model of rating manipulation that accounts for platform enforcement policies, market competition, and class differentiation among service providers. The model shows that stricter sanctions can paradoxically increase incentives to manipulate by reducing competition, while greater competition reduces manipulation. To illustrate the model’s applicability, we analyze hotel reviews from Bangkok collected from Agoda, where only verified customers can post reviews, and TripAdvisor, where reviews are open to all users. The empirical results confirm that lower-class hotels are more prone to manipulation than higher-class hotels, consistent with theoretical predictions. Together, the theoretical and empirical findings provide insights for the design of trust and reputation systems in online platforms, highlighting trade-offs between enforcement, competition, and the integrity of ratings."

    "abstract": "The use of quantum algorithms is rapidly expanding in various industries. These algorithms are run on quantum computers. There is no single technology to build quantum computers, so their architecture varies. For this reason, it is important to optimise the design of a quantum algorithm so that it is implemented on a given quantum computer topology. A two-step solution to this problem is proposed. The first step is to find the initial arrangement of qubits in the quantum scheme - qubit mapping problem. The search is for the arrangement with which the rearranged scheme comes closest to the topology of the quantum computer. The second step is the addition of SWAP operators, which is needed if the required path between two qubits does not exist. This optimisation algorithm has been tested with two algorithms, Bernstein-Varizani and a variational quantum classifier. The performance of the optimisation was also verified by running the optimised quantum circuit on a real quantum computer. After applying these algorithms to selected quantum computers, it can be argued that for most quantum computers, the initial qubit-finding setup is not sufficient and SWAP operators should be used. The probability of finding the initial qubit placement depends on the edge density of the computer topology graph. The higher the density, the higher the probability of finding a suitable layout and the less SWAP operators are used. Also, the larger the topology of the quantum computer, the more SWAP operators are used."

The deep learning model achieved a high True Positive Rate of 94.9% and a low Mean Absolute Error of 0.46 in clean conditions, with a Mean Square Error of 4.30.

    "abstract": "Due to the large size and high interrupting capacity of the contacts, especially in 110 kV and higher voltage level, it is essential to investigate the influence of the contact diameter and the contact distance on the post-arc sheath development in high-current vacuum interruption. The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of the contact diameter and the contact distance on the development of the post-arc sheath in high-current vacuum interruption. The development of the post-arc sheath, as the initial stage of the dielectric recovery, significantly influences the recovery characteristics. A post-arc sheath model for high-current vacuum interruption was developed using the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. Through the simulation of the sheath development process, the characteristics of sheath development under different contact diameters and contact distances were analyzed and determined. For a 70 mm contact distance, as the contact diameter increases from 100 mm to 140 mm, the sheath development time increases from $12.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ to $14.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$, an increase of about $9.38 \\%$; For a contact diameter of 140 mm, as the contact distance increases from 50 mm to 70 mm, the sheath development time increases from $\\mathbf{1 0. 6} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ s to $\\mathbf{1 4. 0} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ s, an increase of about $\\mathbf{3 2. 1 \\%}$. For the large-sized contacts, the increase in contact spacing has a more significant effect on sheath development than the increase in contact diameter. The results of this paper are helpful to understand the physical mechanism of the post-arc dielectric recovery."

    "abstract": "The parameters of microscopic particles during the arcing process of a vacuum arc are among the crucial parameters reflecting the arc state. Specifically, the parameters of the microscopic components of the vacuum arc serve as important indicators for evaluating the degree of ionization of the gap metal vapor. At present, the research methods for the components of vacuum arcs mainly fall into two categories: measuring the charge to mass ratio of ions and conducting spectral diagnosis of the arc. As a non-contact measurement approach, spectral diagnosis can make use of the fact that each particle component corresponds to a characteristic wavelength spectrum to obtain the percentage distribution of the microscopic components of particles. Since the interruption time of a vacuum arc is usually on the millisecond scale, especially for intermediate-frequency vacuum arcs, the half - wave arcing time is only 1.3 ms. However, ordinary spectral analysis systems can only analyze the spectra of power - frequency arcs and lack the analysis of spectral changes within the arcing cycle. Therefore, this paper proposes a staged arc spectrum acquisition system. Moreover, it analyzes the spectra of intermediate-frequency vacuum arcs under ruled curved contacts and obtains the spectral variation trend of a 360 Hz, 7 kA vacuum arc."

    "abstract": "With the popularity of digital marketing, the identification and prediction of the Freebie-Seekers has become particularly critical. This study focuses on two scenarios: live broadcasting and code scanning, aiming to explore and accurately identify such behavior. Traditional identification methods require a lot of manual intervention in model design and parameter adjustment, which not only increases the computational cost, but also makes it difficult to guarantee the accuracy of the final model. We adopt a black-box optimization method to search the parameter space of the model, estimate the conditional probability distributions of the hyperparameters by constructing a Gaussian mixture model, and select the hyperparameter combinations with the best performance based on these distributions. Through feature engineering construction and model selection, we evaluate the LightGBM and XGBoost models. The experimental results reveal that after hyperparameter optimization, both models achieve significant performance improvement, with the F1 value of XGBoost reaching 0.8685 in the QR code scanning scenario, while the F1 value of LightGBM in the live streaming scenario is 0.7662. From the business perspective, our model successfully predicts a large number of Freebie-Seekers in the live streaming and live streaming scenarios. From the business point of view, our model successfully predicts a large number of Freebie-Seekers and reduces the potential economic loss by 20.77% and 1.78% in the live streaming and QR code scanning scenarios, respectively. Therefore, this study not only provides an effective prediction method of Freebie-Seekers, but also provides a strong data support for the strategic decision of digital marketing"

    "abstract": "As an important factor affecting the safe and stable operation of the power system, the icing of transmission lines is particularly prominent in Xinjiang. In this study, taking a 220kV transmission line in Xinjiang as an example, the finite element analysis method is used to deeply discuss the dynamic response characteristics of the transmission tower-line system under the combined load of wind and ice under icing conditions. By establishing a detailed finite element model of the transmission tower-line coupling system, we fully consider the mechanical properties and structural response of the transmission tower and the conductor. The simulation results show that the icing significantly increases the load on the transmission tower, resulting in a significant increase in the displacement of the members, which threatens the overall stability of the structure. In addition, we systematically studied the effects of different wind angles, wind speeds, and ice thickness on the performance of the transmission tower-line system. Among them, there was a significant positive correlation between wind speed and transmission line displacement, and the impact was the most significant. The wire displacement is the largest at the 0° wind angle; Although the influence of ice cover thickness on displacement is relatively small, the influence of wind load may be aggravated under extreme conditions. In order to better predict and manage the safety risks of transmission lines, this study further uses the nonlinear extreme accumulation function model to fit the wind speed, icing thickness and displacement data, and successfully establishes a prediction model, which provides an important quantitative analysis tool for the design and maintenance of transmission lines."

    "abstract": "The pinnacle of transportation is the development of autonomous driving, which, with the help of CAVs and related traffic management systems, can eventually lead to congestion- and accident-free driving. This vision has as of late prodded extraordinary examination interest in fields including IoV, LTE-V2X, and 5G. In any case, the huge volume of traffic information that CAVs produce makes issues for both the current organizations and the approaching 5G correspondence organizations. For outside network innovations, the VMBS fills in as both a client hub and an edge processing hub. For CAVs, it fills in as a base station and a data caching hub, melding correspondence and calculation. People offer both the VMBS-empowered handset and figuring for CAVs as well as the VMBS-helped wireless innovation for other wireless gadgets to achieve this. It is underlined and addressed that there are a number of research obstacles and open questions. Last but not least, the results of the simulation show that the planned VMBS-CCNA may significantly enhance throughput, latency, and the average amount of links."

The globe has fought the epidemic with incredible bravery, and the early phases have been particularly heart-breaking. Correctly wearing a veil had shown to be an effective method of limiting the transmission of illness. We're working on developing a technique that will allow us to detect fine-grained veil wear issues. There are three primary obstacles to overcome in this project: 1) a variety of facial expressions, 2) a variety of veil types and instances; and 3) a variety of facial impediments We built a new, reasonable dataset of 4000 photos to figure out what was causing the issues. The proposed method is to leverage SSD with Caffe and MobileNetV2 engineering as a picture classifier to provide continuous veil recognition. The accuracy of this model is 96 percent. On this decent dataset, more high-level models for warm scanning and facial recognition are constructed."

    "abstract": "Objective: Electrohysterography (EHG) has been shown to provide valuable information for assessing preterm birth risk. However, few studies have focused on multiple gestations (MG), a well-known risk factor for preterm birth. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize and compare uterine EHG signals between singleton (SG) and MG pregnancies during the third trimester. Method: This prospective cohort study analyzed 383 EHG recordings from 61 SG and 92 MG women during the third trimester. A whole-window approach was used to extract four key EHG features: peak-to-peak amplitude (PPA), Kurtosis of the Hilbert Envelope (KHE), median frequency (MDF) and sample entropy (SampEn). Generalized additive models (GAM) were applied to evaluate temporal trends across gestational age (GA) and gestation type (SG and MG). Results: In SG pregnancies, PPA and KHE progressively increased, with a significant rise in KHE at labour. MDF remained stable until labour, while SampEn gradually declined, especially at term. MG pregnancies showed similar but less pronounced trends: MG exhibited a notably earlier activation of uterine activity than SG before 32 weeks of gestation (WoG), and a slowing-down electrophysiological progression beyond 32 WoG, resulting in similar characteristics with no significant differences. Conclusions: These findings provide electrophysiological evidence suggesting that MG pregnancies may enter a labour-preparatory state earlier, potentially increasing the PTB risk, while the later convergence of EHG features may indicate compensatory mechanisms to delay labour. This work integrates EHG signal analysis with clinical obstetric care, offering valuable insights for clinical management and early PTB risk assessment in MG pregnancies."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle (AV) driving is a critical task, and among all driving maneuvers, overtaking is considered the most complex. Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have been utilized for AV driving, leading to human like behavior. Recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have demonstrated impressive performance in handling AV driving maneuvers. However, overtaking involves sequential sub-tasks (lane changes, straight drive) requiring modularized control, and a single RL agent is often ineffective in managing these efficiently. Instead of relying on a single RL agent for the overtaking maneuver, we propose a novel Option Policy driven Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (OP-HDRL) approach to select different sub-maneuver RL agents for overtaking. Each sub-maneuver RL agent is trained to complete simpler sub-tasks of overtaking. Decomposing overtaking into several sub-maneuvers, such as left lane change, straight drive, and right lane change, and training individual DRL agents for each, governed by a single master policy, reduces training time and improves generalization compared to a single RL/DRL agent. Traffic safety rules can be easily integrated into OP-HDRL for the overtaking maneuver. The proposed approach is evaluated through several overtaking scenarios inspired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) pre-crash scenarios, using the CARLA simulator."

    "abstract": "Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been extensively employed for network security. It examines traffic payloads by searching for regular expressions (regex) with the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) model. However, as the network bandwidth and ruleset size are increasing rapidly, the conventional DFA model has emerged as a significant performance bottleneck of DPI. Leveraging the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) instruction to perform state transitions can substantially boost the efficiency of the DFA model. In this paper, we propose Hyperflex, a novel SIMD-based DFA model designed for high-performance regex matching. Hyperflex incorporates a region detection algorithm to identify regions suitable for acceleration by SIMD instructions across the whole DFA graph. Also, we design a hybrid state transition algorithm that enables state transition in both SIMD-accelerated and normal regions, and ensures seamless state transition across the two types of regions. We have implemented Hyperflex on the commodity CPU and evaluated it with real network traffic and DPI regexes. Our evaluation results indicate that Hyperflex reaches a throughput of 8.89Gbit/s, representing an improvement of up to 2.27 times over Mcclellan, the default DFA model of the prominent multi-pattern regex matching engine Hyperscan. As a result, Hyperflex has been successfully deployed in Hyperscan, significantly enhancing its performance."

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of key technologies on physical layer and medium access control layer discussed in the UHR working group. Specifically, it focuses primarily on the related progress of the technologies, such as double low-density parity-check codeword lengths, a new modulation and coding scheme as well as unequal modulation techniques, distributed resource units, multi-access point coordination techniques, non-primary channel access, and seamless roaming, etc. Meanwhile, this paper further reviews the progress related to the low-high frequency common baseband technologies. Finally, a few potential research directions beyond the state-of-the-art technologies discussed in the working group are discussed for the development of WLAN technologies."

    "abstract": "Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are employed to enhance the safety and efficiency of transportation systems. However, their connectivity makes them vulnerable to various types of attacks, such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, which can lead to unsafe scenarios. Therefore, there is a need to develop a framework to test and verify the security of CAVs under such attacks. Currently, researchers test the security of CAVs by generating manual and random attacks, but there is no automatic attack generation with proof of convergence. In this paper, for the first time, we look at testing and verification as a feedback control system problem with unknown dynamics. We introduce a novel <strike xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">centralized</strike> multi-agent attack generator designed to evaluate the safety and security of CAVs under FDI attacks. Our approach begins with the development of a verification signal to systematically assess the safety and performance of CAVs. We then design a reinforcement learning-based FDI attack generator, capable of estimating the unknown nonlinear relationship between the injected FDI attack and the verification signal, ultimately generating scenarios that compromise safety. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to ensure the asymptotic convergence of the verification signal error. We employ the proposed reinforcement learning (RL)-based FDI attack generator on a cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) system as a case study, demonstrating its capability to create challenging and unsafe scenarios."

    "abstract": "Taking single-break DC vacuum circuit breakers as the research object, an experimental platform for collecting characteristic information of single-break DC vacuum arcs was established. Images of the zero-zone process of vacuum arcs were captured. Based on image processing technology, characteristic parameters of vacuum arc images were extracted and digitally processed. Using pseudo-color processing, the regions of plasma concentration distribution in the arc were divided, and the curve of changes in the area of plasma temperature regions during the zero-zone process was obtained. Through arc image processing, the growth curves of the area of different temperature regions in the vacuum arc are obtained to investigate the impact of the gap on the rapid dissipation of arc energy. The arc morphology and plasma distribution characteristics of flat contacts and transverse magnetic contacts are compared to study the equivalent influence of the gap between flat contacts and the self-generated magnetic field of transverse magnetic contacts on the breaking performance. The trend of arc area changes under a 6 mm transverse magnetic contact gap and an 8 mm flat contact gap is comparable. The equivalence of gaps is discussed at different stages of arc development. The equivalent relationship between gaps and arc control capability under the same operating conditions for the 卍-shaped transverse magnetic contact structure is established, providing data support for the argument of gap equivalence. This study provides an optimization direction for enhancing the breaking capability of DC vacuum circuit breakers."

Reversable mode transitions were studied more in detail by combined optical diagnostics, which comprises high-speed imaging, spectroscopic measurements and high-speed thermography. A correlation between arc voltage and anode surface temperature in case of spot-to-plume transition was revealed.

The pulsed vacuum arc current was 200 A at a pulse duration of $250 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$. It was found that the specific erosion of cathodes with a melting point less than 650 K was many times greater than for more refractory cathode materials with a melting point above 900 K. The measured cathode surface temperature was up to 800 K which is higher than the melting temperature of low-melting cathodes. The COMSOL Multiphysics simulation showed that the cathode surface melting depth per a single arc pulse was tens of micrometers. Control experiments with a silumin cathode also confirmed melting of the cathode material to a depth of several tens of micrometers. It was concluded that the high erosion of low-melting cathodes was due to sputtering of the surface cathode material by the cathode spot and generation of an intense flux of macroparticles."

The regression identified marital status (β = 0.204, P = 0.002) and income (β = –0.210, P = 0.001).Among all sociodemographic characteristics there was a tendency to see some predictor variables (HMO-001) that emerged interestingly consistent (adjusted R² = 0.083). The use of visual representations, heatmaps, boxplots and bar charts helped explain the distribution of SCNS. Briefly, patients with lower socioeconomic characteristics and married patients were characterized by a higher demand. These outcomes provide a framework for locally-tailored evidence-informed nursing interventions for radiotherapy."

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression is a critical marker of cerebral small vessel disease; however, its prediction remains challenging due to inter-institutional variability and the inherently non-deterministic nature of lesion evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate preprocessing strategies and prediction frameworks for WMH progression using a large-scale, multi-institutional dataset from the PICASSO trial (67 institutions). We compared three preprocessing pipelines, harmonization, normalization, and their combination, with three prediction frameworks: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-to-FLAIR, WMH-to-WMH, and disease evolution map (DEM). These were assessed in conjunction with multiple deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate that harmonization substantially reduces inter-institutional variability and that the DEM framework consistently outperforms direct image-to-image prediction in volumetric and spatial agreement. Furthermore, we provide the first direct comparison of U-Net, GAN, and diffusion models under identical experimental conditions, showing that diffusion models deliver balanced performance in capturing non-deterministic lesion dynamics. At the same time, U-Net achieves the highest spatial agreement. Collectively, these findings establish the first comprehensive benchmark of WMH progression prediction across preprocessing strategies, prediction frameworks, and model architectures, and underscore the translational potential of DEM-based prediction with harmonization for individualized risk stratification and clinical decision-making."

By optimizing the modulation parameters that generate equivalent amplitude-phase weighting for each antenna element in the radio frequency channel, the main beam of the first-order harmonic and nulls of higher-order harmonics are simultaneously steered toward the desired direction. This enables efficient transmission of signals with bandwidths exceeding the modulation frequency. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional approaches, the proposed method incorporates the degree of harmonic energy aliasing across all orders at non-target directions into the optimization objective, thereby enhancing signal distortion and ensuring robust information security at these directions. Numerical simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the communication bit error rate decreases to as low as 1 × 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup> at the target communication direction, whereas it exceeds 30% at all non-target directions within -40° to 40°."

    "abstract": "Transformers are subjected to severe mechanical stress during external short-circuit faults due to intense radial electromagnetic forces, which can lead to winding deformation and structural failure. To address this issue, this study proposes a systematic design methodology for a resistive-type superconducting fault current limiter (R-SFCL) aimed at suppressing fault currents below critical thresholds to protect transformer windings. The proposed approach integrates mechanical finite element (FE) analysis, field-circuit coupling simulations, and electrothermal modeling to determine the critical yielding radial force of transformer windings based on elastoplastic theory, identify the short-circuit currents levels that induce plastic deformation, and optimize high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape dimensions to achieve effective current limitation while maintaining thermal safety. For a 110 kV/40 MVA transformer, an R-SFCL with 4800 m of HTS tape reduces peak fault current by 42% to 2855 A, limits conductor stress to 60 MPa (50% yield strength), and maintains temperatures below 473 K during faults, demonstrating effectiveness in preventing irreversible mechanical damage of winding."

    "abstract": "Object detection technology for UAV images holds significant importance in various fields. However, many existing object detection algorithms suffer from limited detection accuracy, along with issues like small-target missed or false detections. Given the resource-constrained UAV devices, balancing model complexity and detection performance is crucial for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an enhanced object detection algorithm, BBD-YOLO, which incorporates dynamic sparse attention and multi-scale feature fusion. First, a dynamic sparse attention module grounded in bilevel routing is integrated into the backbone network. This integration serves to strengthen the algorithm’s feature extraction capability, thereby boosting the detection accuracy of small targets. Second, the neck network is reengineered through a bidirectional feature pyramid. This modification aims to enhance the algorithm’s multi-scale feature fusion ability, enabling it to perform more effectively in detecting targets of varying sizes. Third, Inner-IoU is introduced to develop a new loss function, Inner-CIoU, which overcomes the poor generalization ability of the original bounding box regression loss function and improves the algorithm’s detection accuracy. Finally, to tackle the problem of substantial feature information loss during down-sampling, an object detection head founded on a unified attention mechanism is designed. This mechanism enhances the feature representation ability of the object detection head, contributing to more accurate object detection. Comparison experiments are conducted on the VisDrone2019 public dataset. The findings reveal that, when compared with the baseline algorithm YOLOv8, BBD-YOLO achieves remarkable improvements in overall performance. Specifically, it has enhanced mAP50 by 4.0%, mAP50:95 by 2.5%, Precision by 3.1%, and Recall by 2.9%, respectively. Notably, these performance gains have been achieved with a parameter count (3.00M) nearly identical to the baseline (3.01M) and an acceptable increase in FLOPs (9.3G vs. 8.1G of the baseline), ensuring computational feasibility for resource-constrained UAV scenarios. Furthermore, on the VisDrone2019 and DOTAv1.0 datasets, BBD-YOLO outperforms multiple algorithms such as SSD, Faster R-CNN, and various models in the YOLO series, including several state-of-the-art object detection models specifically designed for UAV images. This demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority in the field of UAV-based object detection."

    "abstract": "Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods, and other Residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our learned policies in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer."

    "abstract": "Large-scale water electrolyzers have the ability to operate as flexible loads, absorbing power fluctuations in power systems with high or full share of variable renewable energy sources (VRESs). For large-scale industrial applications, alkaline water electrolyzers (AWEs) and thyristor-based power converter topologies are commonly used due to their lower cost compared to proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) and transistor-based topologies. However, thyristor-rectifiers have a significant ripple when operated at partial load. A wide operational range is required when electrolyzers operate in a flexible manner, and large current ripples due to the power converter topology increase the power losses in the electrolyzer. Therefore, it is essential to study the impact of the current ripple on AWE performance. This article proposes an evaluation approach to systematically assess the impact of different power converter topologies on AWE losses, including an electrolyzer model for power electronic applications and experimental verification. Realistic current waveforms for industrial applications are obtained from a simulated large-scale electrolyzer system, and these waveforms are tested in a small-scale experimental setup. The experimental results validate the large-scale system simulations and the proposed model and provide quantitative assessment of AWE losses caused by the current ripple. The results also show that the six-pulse thyristor rectifier has the highest current ripples, causing the highest additional losses in the electrolyzer."

    "abstract": "Clinical imaging protocols designed to accelerate acquisition or reduce radiation dose often lead to degraded image quality, compromising diagnostic confidence. The heterogeneity in degradation types and severities across imaging modalities further challenges the development of generalized restoration solutions. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that formulates medical image restoration as posterior sampling from self-supervised Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), pretrained on multi-modal high-quality images. At the core of our method is an Estimation Posterior Sampling (EPS) strategy, which enhances both data fidelity and anatomical detail retention. EPS incorporates two key components: (i) estimated diffusion initialization to constrain sampling within the measurement-consistent solution space, and (ii) gradient-balanced optimization to adaptively trade off denoising strength and detail preservation throughout the diffusion trajectory. Unlike traditional task-specific models, our approach enables Plug-and-Play (PnP) deployment, supporting diverse degradations without retraining. Extensive experiments conducted on deterministic degradations (e.g., under-sampled MRI, sparse-view CT) and blind degradations (e.g., low-dose PET) across multiple degradation levels demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to both supervised baselines and state-of-the-art posterior sampling methods. Notably, our method achieves PSNR improvements of up to +2.9 dB (MRI), +1.1 dB (CT), and +0.9 dB (PET) in PnP mode. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of our framework for clinical deployment."

In this framework, the algorithms have to be equipped with fast convergence/tracking features while should also be robust to different background perturbations. In terms of the convergence criteria, the decomposition-based recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm represents a very appealing choice. It exploits an impulse response decomposition that relies on low-rank approximations and combines the estimates provided by two shorter adaptive filters using the nearest Kronecker product (NKP). In this paper, we develop a regularized version of the RLS-NKP algorithm with improved robustness features. The regularization components incorporate specific terms related to the background perturbations and model uncertainties, which are evaluated in a simple yet practical manner. Simulation results obtained in the context of network and acoustic echo cancellation support the performance gain."

The objective of this paper is to experimentally compare the vacuum arc characteristics of the composite magnetic field contacts with fixed break under two different fixed contact structures. The composite magnetic field contact consists of a pair of inner movable TMF contacts and a pair of outer fixed AMF contacts. The coil-type AMF contact and the horseshoe-type bipolar AMF contact were adopted as the fixed breaks. The contact diameter was 85 mm, and the contact gap of the fixed break was 14 mm. Drawn arc experiments were carried out with a demountable vacuum chamber. The arc current level was set as 15 kA with frequency of $\\mathbf{4 4. 5 ~ H z}$. From the results, for both contact structures, part of arc current can transfer from the inner TMF contact to the outer AMF contact, and the diffused arc duration before current zero can reach $\\mathbf{2. 0 ~ m s}$. And the horseshoe-type bipolar AMF contact structure is more suitable for the fixed break in the composite magnetic field contact, for it can achieve higher current transfer rate, reduce erosion of the inner TMF contact and reduce metal drops between contacts before current zero."

The objective of this paper is to determine the effect of various contacts magnetic field modes on the current transfer characteristics in hybrid breaking process. Various magnetic field contact modes have a significant influence on the current transfer time and transfer speed. The results indicate that, as the current increases from 2 kA to 11 kA, the current transmission time in all magnetic field contact modes shows a linear increasing trend.

    "abstract": "Sketch-photo recognition refers to matching hand-drawn sketches with their corresponding photos, where the performance essentially depends on how well the presentations of the two modalities are aligned in the feature spaces. Existing works bluntly force model to reduce the representation discrepancy between the modalities, making the learning less effective. Besides, the current symmetric feature extraction framework prefers photo modality for richer information while neglecting sketch modality. Driven by those observations, we argue that, instead of forcefully wiping out the modality discrepancy, we may utilize the discrepancy to enhance the model learning. Thus, we propose a Cross-Modality Bootstrapping learning framework (CROMBO) that utilizes the modality discrepancy to bootstrap the cross-modality representation learning via a differentiated interaction manner. Specifically, we first present a Sketch Implicit Bootstrapping (SIB) module to magnify the recognizable elements in photo modality by utilizing the characteristic of sketch only with contour and key detail. Second, a Photo-driven Sketch Refinement (PSR) module is developed to guide the sketch representation in shared feature extraction by supplementing rich information from photo modality. Moreover, we design a second-order alignment strategy to dynamically align the latent distribution of two modalities in Hilbert space. Also, our CROMBO can learn fewer parameters by freezing the weights of shallow layers in the backbone while making no sacrifice for performance. Extensive experiments on six public datasets verify the superior performance of our CROMBO for sketch-photo based tasks, such as sketch re-identification, sketch-photo face recognition and sketch-based image retrieval."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted many facets of contemporary life, and several sophisticated IoT applications and services are already being developed. Recently, the concept of federated learning has been proposed in order to train a globally shared model on IoT devices utilising a large number of user-generated data samples while stopping data leak. Due to the widespread heterogeneities in device, statistics, and model in complex IoT contexts, traditional federated learning is not suitable for instant implementation. In this paper, we present a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications that includes a customised federated learning framework. To address the heterogeneity worries in IoT conditions, we examine imaginative altered united learning calculations that could diminish the unfortunate results brought about by heterogeneities in various aspects. The advantages of edge registering empower smart IoT applications to meet the models for high handling pace and low inertness. At long last, we give a contextual investigation of human movement recognition in light of Web of Things to show the advantages of customisable combined learning for intelligent IoT applications."

The system achieved rapid resonance frequency calibration through fixed-frequency excitation, optimized impedance matching circuit design, and efficient coordination of RF transceiver modules. In order to estimate the performance of the passive wireless test system, it is used to an LC resonant sensor for displacement and pressure detection. Displacement tests revealed a linear frequency tuning characteristic of −2.33 MHz/mm; pressure tests exhibited nonlinear sensitivity, showing a sensitivity of −1.25 MHz/N in the low-pressure region 0 – 20 N and −0.04 MHz/N in the high-pressure region 20 –100 N. Test results confirmed reduced power consumption, significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio, a frequency measurement standard deviation of 1.47 MHz, and a maximum frequency offset of 3.36 MHz compared to traditional sweep-frequency approaches. This work provides a feasible technical solution for low-cost, high-precision monitoring in wireless sensor networks."

Here, we leverage the wide-swath interferometric capability of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and develop a two-part framework for ISW characterization. First, a dedicated SSH anomaly (SSHA) processing workflow and two-dimensional feature-extraction algorithm jointly enhance ISW detectability and delineate perturbation stripes with high fidelity. Second, an amplitude inversion scheme, combining corrected vertical mode functions, enables quantitative retrieval of strongly nonlinear ISW amplitudes from SWOT SSHA. Application to the Maluku Sea reveals basin-scale ISW activity, with perturbations of 10–20 cm and enhanced SSHA amplitudes exceeding 30 cm. Comparative case studies over the Amazon Shelf and Sulu Sea highlight SWOT's superior spatial resolution relative to Sentinel-3, while coordinated SWOT–mooring experiments in the South China Sea yield ISW amplitude inversion relative errors of 11% and 7.7% The results demonstrate that SWOT observations, combined with the proposed framework, provide a powerful means for quantitative detection and characterization of ISWs from SSH measurements."

    "abstract": "Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) leveraging millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications and directional antennas offer high-capacity and low-latency connectivity for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, dynamic topologies, deafness, and hidden terminal problems make medium access control (MAC) protocol design challenging. Existing approaches, ranging from traditional contention-based schemes to learning-enabled methods, often suffer from inefficiency, high overhead, or excessive computational complexity. This paper proposes the Fairness-Aware Learning Automaton-based Directional MAC (F-LA-DMAC), a distributed protocol that maximizes spatial reuse while ensuring equitable channel access. We first establish a theoretical throughput upper bound using a conflict-graph model. We then design F-LA-DMAC, where each node updates its transmit/receive probabilities through local environmental feedback. A fairness mechanism further balances throughput and fairness by dynamically adjusting a tunable parameter. Simulations show that F-LA-DMAC achieves up to 86% higher throughput and 67% lower delay compared with deep reinforcement learning baselines (DDMAC and DDDMAC) in dense networks. Pareto frontier analysis reveals that F-LA-DMAC sustains a Jain's fairness index of 0.96–0.98 while operating near peak throughput. We also analyze computational complexity and demonstrate that F-LA-DMAC incurs only linear runtime and memory overhead, making it suitable for embedded UAV platforms. In contrast, DDMAC and DDDMAC require costly neural inference and specialized hardware due to their polynomial complexity. Finally, FPGA-based experiments confirm the protocol's feasibility in practice and validate its effectiveness in achieving the throughput–fairness trade-off."

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to mental health assessment rely on episodic self-reports and clinical interviews, which are inherently subjective and fail to capture the dynamic nature of psychological well-being. In this work, we propose the Mental Health Index (MHI), a personalized and explainable framework for real-time mental health monitoring. The system integrates multimodal physiological signals—Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), and Respiration Rate (RR)—with behavioral data such as sleep and physical activity. At its core, the MHI employs a multi-task Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, pre-trained on synthetic data and fine-tuned on an individual’s 2–4-week calibration period. Personalization is achieved using Isolation Forest–based baseline calibration, ensuring robustness against anomalies. To enhance trust and interpretability, the framework generates a composite MHI score by combining the model’s predictions with transparent, rule-based sub-scores. Our evaluation on a 90-day synthetic dataset demonstrates that the proposed MHI-GRU achieves strong performance (RMSE = 14.49, MAE = 8.06; mood classification accuracy = 93.9%), while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment. Evaluation across five random seeds and k-fold cross-validation confirmed stable convergence (variance < ±1%) and reproducibility, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed MHI-GRU under diverse initialization conditions. The MHI framework represents a step towards continuous, individualized, and explainable mental health monitoring, with potential applications in personal wellness tracking and high-stress occupational settings."

    "abstract": "Public opinion management plays a vital role in both government governance and corporate competition. Opinion dynamics provides a key framework for its study, with the classic Hegselmann–Krause (HK) model using confidence thresholds to define individuals’ opinion exploration and interaction ranges. However, many existing studies treat these thresholds as exogenous, overlooking the influence of internal psychological traits—particularly self-confidence—on external exploratory behavior. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-confidence-driven HK (SCD-HK) model by establishing a driving relationship between individuals’ internal self-confidence levels and their external confidence thresholds. Based on this, we develop an optimal intervention model under time constraints to guide public opinion evolution. Numerical analyses, including sensitivity tests, comparative experiments, and a case study, reveal that: 1) moderate self-confidence levels better promote consensus than extreme values; 2) a concave relationship between self-confidence and confidence thresholds better facilitates consensus; and 3) our SCD-HK model outperforms traditional models in consensus ratio, convergence speed, and intervention cost. This article highlights the importance of incorporating the relationship between individuals’ inherent self-confidence levels and external confidence thresholds in opinion evolution, and our findings offer practical insights for more effective opinion management."

These attacks aim to undermine anonymization effectiveness, mislead anonymized outputs and downstream tasks, or modify facial attributes in subtle ways. For each scenario, we develop novel strategies that craft perturbations tailored to a user’s face and transferable across different keys and models. Experimental findings reveal that Antiano achieves significant attack effectiveness against various reversible anonymization models, highlighting security vulnerabilities in current deep learning anonymization algorithms. This paper also distinguishes Antiano from traditional adversarial attacks and provides security recommendations for the future development of facial anonymization technologies."

However, existing centralized identity management solutions rely on third-party operators, posing privacy risks and limiting user control. The decentralized solutions seek to address the issues but often fall short in privacy preservation, efficiency, and cross-application compatibility. In this paper, we propose PPUgIM, a user-governed identity management scheme with universally composable security, emphasizing privacy and data sovereignty in distributed mobile applications. PPUgIM introduces a DID-like account equipped with multi-attribute credentials, enabling users to autonomously manage and selectively disclose various identities without revealing sensitive information. An enhanced authenticated data structure is designed based on vector commitments, supporting short and constant-size proofs for efficient batch authentication of attribute credentials. Furthermore, a formal security analysis of PPUgIM is conducted, and a prototype implementation is developed for performance evaluation. Results show that credential generation takes 500 ms, verification 110 ms, with a constant size proof of 0.15 KB. Proof overhead for identities is reduced by 38.1% compared with existing schemes, demonstrating PPUgIM’s practicality in real-world distributed mobile applications."

    "abstract": "With the emergence of virtual AI streamers, choosing between a virtual streamer and a live streamer is a crucial decision for the brand manufacturer when launching a live-streaming business. This paper examines a dual-channel supply chain model consisting of a brand manufacturer, a store retailer, and either an artificial intelligence (AI) streamer or a key opinion leader (KOL) streamer. KOL streamers possess significant advantages over AI streamers due to their ability to interact effectively with consumers and their large fan bases. However, participating in pre-arranged KOL live-streaming events can incur a hassle cost for consumers, which is not required for AI streamers. Additionally, when collaborating with a KOL, the brand manufacturer must pay a fixed payment and a commission rate on revenues generated from live-streaming e-commerce, which can be ignored for AI streamers. Our research indicates that the costs associating with KOLs are a key factor in mode selection. We identify cost thresholds under which the brand manufacturer may prefer the KOL live-streaming mode over the AI mode. We also find that the hassle cost is a double-edged sword for the brand manufacturer. When the hassle cost is high, the KOL mode may still be preferred over AI mode. We then derive the retailer's mode preference and identify the conditions for achieving a common preference for the brand manufacturer and the retailer in both live-streaming scenarios. Finally, we conduct three extensions: considering product returns, exploring an alternative in-house live-streaming mode to the KOL mode, and examining the implications of an existing online channel. Results show that the findings of the main model remain robust."

    "abstract": "The field of knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) has been rapidly expanding. To effectively apply KGRL models to large real-world knowledge graphs (KGs), anchor-based methods have been proposed. These methods aim to reduce computational costs and parameter requirements by encoding entities using a small set of entity anchors. However, existing anchor selection approaches are often rudimentary and sometimes yield suboptimal results. In this article, we propose a scalable anchor-based KGRL method called SKIP. By leveraging prototype information, our method selects representative entities as anchors. The SKIP method consists of two main steps. First, pretraining models are employed to encode entities by utilizing the topological structure and textual information in KGs. Second, the prototype learning module (PLM) extracts entity prototypes, which are then used to sample entity anchors that contain valuable prototype information. These settings enable SKIP to identify representative and reasonable entity anchors, leading to improved performance while requiring fewer computational resources. Extensive experiments conducted on various downstream tasks using KGs of different scales demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of SKIP. Particularly, on the large OGB WikiKG 2 dataset, our method achieves comparable performance while reducing running time by approximately 21.28% and requiring 21.43% fewer model parameters compared to the baseline. This indicates the superior scalability of SKIP."

    "abstract": "Hot rolling production scheduling (HRPS) is an essential process in modern steel manufacturing. Its effectiveness is influenced by three primary challenges: selecting suitable slabs to maximize efficiency and maintain product quality, adhering to increasingly stringent carbon tax regulations, and managing uncertainties in processing times stemming from fluctuations in rolling speed. This article presents a novel robust HRPS problem under carbon tax regulation (RHRPSP-CTR) that considers slab selection, carbon tax regulation, and uncertain processing times simultaneously for the first time. Based on a budgeted uncertainty set, we develop a robust counterpart model that utilizes a classical dualization scheme and dynamic programming recursive equations to address the challenges associated with evaluating the worst case cost of carbon emissions (CEs) and determining the worst case completion time for each slab caused by processing time uncertainty, respectively. Recognizing the characteristics of slab selection and the high computational complexity in the large-scale RHRPSP-CTR, we propose an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm incorporating two enhancement strategies: a slab selection rule and a max–min weight update mechanism. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed method yields optimal solutions for small-scale problem instances and high-quality, robust solutions for large-scale instances within a relatively short computation time. Moreover, the results indicate that compared with deterministic HRPS schemes, robust HRPS schemes lead to only a slight increase in cost. Notably, a higher carbon tax does not necessarily lead to lower CEs, and a larger uncertainty budget coefficient or uncertainty range does not always result in higher CEs."

    "abstract": "Robotic mobility and stability on uneven terrain remain significant challenges in mobile base platform design, particularly when aiming to extend the capabilities of existing industrial manipulators to real-world environments. This study presents a terrain-adaptive mobile base platform that autonomously adjusts its leg configurations to maintain stability while traversing uneven or inclined surfaces. By integrating the mobile base with standard industrial robot controllers, the proposed approach enables the practical deployment of six-axis industrial articulated manipulators in logistics and construction environments. A novel ground reaction force (GRF) estimation scheme is proposed, taking advantage of lift-motor torque analysis without additional force sensors. To further improve the accuracy of the estimation, friction torque modeling based on Sparse Gaussian Process Regression (SGPR) is incorporated to compensate for unmodeled disturbances. In addition, a gravity compensation mechanism (GCM) is implemented to reduce actuator torque requirements, thereby enhancing overall energy efficiency. Furthermore, stability is quantitatively ensured through a Zero Moment Point (ZMP)-based control framework, in which the Sugano stability degree is employed to optimize pan angles under various leg lift configurations. This allows the system to autonomously adapt to center-of-mass (CoM) shifts, ensuring sustained stability in both static and dynamic scenarios. The proposed platform is validated through extensive experiments, including slope traversal on a 5° incline, real-time adaptation to CoM shifts induced by a 10 kg payload, and robustness tests under external disturbances. The results confirm that the system effectively minimizes roll and pitch deviations, maintains stability during load variations, and achieves accurate GRF prediction for reliable operation. This research contributes to the development of intelligent mobile manipulation platforms that facilitate the practical use of six-axis industrial articulated manipulators in unstructured environments."

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical diagnostics has highlighted an essential need for transparent and interpretable systems, particularly in the field of mental health. The opaque decision-making in “black-box” AI models creates a challenge in clinical settings: they risk losing trust or causing uncritical reliance. This paradox jeopardizes mental healthcare, where skepticism or unwarranted confidence in AI can harm patient care. Effective explainability mechanisms are therefore essential not only to earn trust but to support responsible use by allowing clinicians to critically assess and verify AI-driven outputs. Thus, we propose a novel explainable AI (XAI) pipeline for automated depression diagnosis, designed to integrate both system-level and human-level interpretability. This dual approach is vital in clinical settings, as it combines rigorous statistical validation with clear, actionable insights that enhance practitioner confidence in AI-generated diagnoses. The pipeline leverages deep learning models for classification, augmented by traditional system-level XAI techniques and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM). With the integration of LLMs, the system translates abstract system-level explanations into understandable, natural language narratives. This provides a crucial cross-verification step that fosters calibrated trust: it mitigates the dual risks of under-trust, by providing a clear rationale, and over-trust, by flagging diagnostic inconsistencies within the AI models. This capability is critical for ensuring both user trust and satisfaction, as it empowers practitioners to critically assess and validate AI-driven insights. Through comprehensive human evaluations conducted by medical professionals, this approach demonstrates high alignment with clinical diagnostic indicators, underscoring the value of combining system-level and human-level explanations to make complex AI processes transparent and clinically meaningful. Validated across three diverse datasets-KangNing, EDAIC-WOZ, and CALLM-each presenting unique structural challenges from structured clinical inquiries to narrative-driven dialogues, our method bridges the gap between technical AI outputs and practitioner understanding, marking a significant advancement toward a trust-based, widely adoptable AI diagnostic tool in mental health care. By introducing a comprehensive framework for combining statistical rigor with narrative clarity, this work represents a critical step toward closing the gap between black-box AI systems and real-world clinical adoption. While our study is limited to depression diagnosis, the proposed framework illustrates a pathway toward explainable clinical AI systems. Future work may explore its adaptability to other medical contexts."

    "abstract": "The study of the environment is one of the permanent objectives of research and innovation. Although numerous monitoring techniques are available, a constant interest in recent times is the use of acoustic methods. There are a multitude of recently published studies that focus on echo-acoustics. Many of these studies are actually partial monitoring and have as their objective the identification of the behavior of certain species of birds or animals. A quasi-complete monitoring of the area and the species that populate it is much more complicated. From the point of view of signal processing techniques, there are solutions that are sufficiently precise for a classification of the received audio signals, but sometimes of high computational complexity. If the monitoring is done through a sensor network, one of the problems that arise is the arrangement of the sensors in a given physical area. It has been previously established that a longitudinal arrangement of the sensors is more efficient than a mesh or grid arrangement, but that the reduction obtained depends on the shape of the monitored area and is not always significant. In this paper we explore the topic of acoustic sensor distribution in a protected area. General considerations are followed by the description of a specific case: a protected area in the vicinity of a lake in Transylvania."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the critical challenge of fault current breaking in flexible high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. The low damping characteristic of flexible HVDC transmission systems determines that the rate of current rise is very high during the initial stage of a short-circuit fault. High-voltage direct current circuit breakers are crucial equipment for rapidly limiting and cutting off faults, isolating fault points in the line, and are the most critical components for protecting flexible DC grid equipment. This paper proposes a resonant high-voltage DC circuit breaker topology based on full-bridge submodules. The working principle of this resonant high-voltage DC circuit breaker is introduced, and the feasibility of its artificial zero-crossing based on full-bridge submodules is verified through simulation. A fault current breaking test circuit is designed, short-circuit current breaking tests are conducted, and the results show that the proposed resonant high-voltage DC circuit breaker can interrupt the fault current in an extremely short time, with the overvoltage and energy loss generated during the breaking process remaining within controllable limits. Finally, based on the simulation and test results, the advantages of this resonant high-voltage DC circuit breaker are summarized, this paper also proposes directions for further optimization and improvement, paving the way for its practical implementation in real-world engineering projects."

Typical examples are water pumps in heating systems or in agriculture powered by PV panels. However, even on sunny days, clouds can appear temporarily which can significantly reduce the power generated by PV panel. Hence, it might be efficient to additionally use for example batteries or supercapacitors which can contribute to the power supply of water pumps when PV panels are shaded by clouds for short periods of time. This allows the pump to operate continuously without the need to choose powerful and massive PV panels that can provide the required power even in cloudy weather. In this work, a model for the operation of water pump power supply with PV panel and supercapacitor circuit was developed with separate and independent mode control diagrams for PV panel, supercapacitor circuit and water pump.

    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-view clustering enables the exploration of cellular heterogeneity within the same cell from different views. Despite the development of several multi-view clustering methods, two primary challenges persist. Firstly, most existing methods treat the information from both single-cell RNA (scRNA) and single-cell Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) views as equally significant, overlooking the substantial disparity in data richness between the two views. This oversight frequently leads to a degradation in overall performance. Additionally, the majority of clustering methods necessitate manual specification of the number of clusters by users. However, for biologists dealing with cell data, precisely determining the number of distinct cell types poses a formidable challenge. To this end, we introduce scUNC, an innovative multi-view clustering approach tailored for single-cell data, which seamlessly integrates information from different views without the need for a predefined number of clusters. The scUNC method comprises several steps: initially, it employs a cross-view fusion network to create an effective embedding, which is then utilized to generate initial clusters via community detection. Subsequently, the clusters are automatically merged and optimized until no further clusters can be merged. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of scUNC using six distinct single-cell datasets. The results underscored that scUNC outperforms the other baseline methods.

A novel probabilistic roadmaps trajectory homotopy (PRMTH) approach has been developed to navigate potential obstacles in environments with limited perception. An optimal multilayer map iSLAM method is proposed to update the map and improve the adaptability of obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicles. Based on the ECPP method, ECPP and LCD mapping algorithms are developed considering the mapping coverage rate, trajectory length, and turning radius constraints. The final planning trajectory of the LCD is smoothed using the Dubins algorithm. A grid-based iSLAM method is proposed to address the challenges of map updating for autonomous vehicles operating in obstacle-rich environments. The results of the simulations and experiments show that the proposed ECPP and LCD strategies can provide an optimal solution to incremental simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous vehicles."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have raised growing privacy concerns. One notable concern of ML models is the membership leakage risk, which is defined as the extent to which an adversary can accurately determine whether a record was part of a model's training set through membership inference attacks (MIAs). While extensively studied in non-time-series models, this risk remains largely unexplored for time-series prediction models. To address this gap, this work aims to provide a precise evaluation of membership leakage risks for time-series prediction models. We first conduct an empirical analysis to identify distinct temporal discrepancies within sequential outputs between member and non-member samples in time-series models. Beyond global temporal discrepancies, our findings show that member records exhibit notable local discrepancies, including smaller fluctuations in their output sequences when actual values remain constant and more rapid adjustments when actual values change, compared with non-member records. Building on these insights, we propose TSP-MIA, a framework that leverages a patch-based attack model to capture both global and local discrepancies for more effective MIAs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TSP-MIA, revealing substantial membership leakage risks for time-series prediction models. We further assess the validity of existing defense mechanisms against TSP-MIA."

    "abstract": "Precise multi-channel distance measurement is crucial for many fields such as fundamental scientific research and industrial measurement. However, existing laser ranging technologies face limitations including restricted multi-channel scalability, demanding fabrication requirements, high costs, and structural complexity. A multi-channel absolute distance measurement method based on optical carrier-based microwave scanning interferometry (OCMSI) with frequency division multiplexing is proposed in this paper. Different measurement channels are allocated to distinct microwave frequency bands, and channels are physically isolated using bandpass filters, effectively eliminating the impact of inter-channel crosstalk on distance measurement. The multi-channel absolute distance measurement is achieved without requiring additional optical carrier-based microwave modulation, demodulation, or data acquisition equipment. A data processing approach combining data segmentation, amplitude-modulated root-cosine (AMRC) function fitting, and a global optimization algorithm is proposed. Distance calculation is accomplished by leveraging amplitude spectrum information. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed multi-channel ranging method and data processing approach. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-channel ranging method achieves a measurement accuracy better than ±37 μm and repeatability better than 19 μm. Furthermore, by increasing the sweep bandwidth, the accuracy and repeatability can be improved to ±20 μm and 2 μm, respectively."

    "abstract": "Narrow linewidth microwave oscillators are critical components in radar, quantum precision measurement, and wireless communication systems. However, traditional optoelectronic oscillators (OEO) are prone to introducing additional noise due to the use of electrical signals, making it difficult to overcome the “electronic bottleneck” of high frequency and low stability. Generating a pure single longitudinal mode (SLM) microwave signal output with narrow linewidth and high gain remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a parity-time (PT) symmetric all-optical optomechanically microwave oscillator (OM-MO) based on the birefringence of a z-cut lithium niobate phase modulator (LN-PM), which realizes SLM microwave photonics output with a linewidth of the order of Hz. The system utilizes the intrinsic birefringence characteristics of the z-cut LN-PM to naturally form gain and loss loops in the cavity. Precise control of the polarization state of forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) light injected into the LN-PM triggers symmetry breaking of the PT system. Ultimately, the experiment achieved SLM microwave signal at 319.2 MHz -R07 microwave photonics (MWPs). Experiments demonstrate that the OM-MO achieves a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of up to 42.09 dB and a measured linewidth of 0.9 kHz at -20 dB (with an intrinsic linewidth of 45.2 Hz). Additionally, it exhibits phase noise as low as -117 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 10 kHz. Compared to existing PT-symmetric microwave oscillators, this scheme uses a self-excited pump source, eliminating the need for electrical signal modulation and significantly simplifying the system structure. This system provides a high-performance microwave photonics solution for applications such as radar imaging and coherent communication."

However, their deployment in resource-constrained and physically exposed environments raises serious concerns about hardware reliability and security. Faults in these systems can be transient (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, due to voltage fluctuations or radiation), permanent (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e.g.</i>, aging or manufacturing defects), or even adversarially induced through targeted bit-flip attacks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of hardware faults in AI accelerators, with a particular focus on edge deployment scenarios.We examine the fault models, detection and mitigation techniques, and unique challenges posed by limited on-chip resources and real-time constraints. Unlike prior surveys focusing mainly on random fault tolerance in general-purpose settings, our work highlights how faults at the edge can also be intentional attack vectors, blurring the line between reliability and security. The goal is to guide the development of resilient edge AI hardware capable of withstanding natural and malicious fault events."

However, existing data-driven modeling methods lack generalization across diverse operating scenarios including operating conditions, modulation strategies and circuit topologies. Furthermore, these methods typically require extensive data and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, this article proposes the C2G method for performance modeling of power converters. The method leverages graph neural networks to comprehensively capture the global graph features of power converters and combines with domain adaptive technique to achieve efficient generalization modeling across multiple operating scenarios, which maintains high prediction accuracy even with limited data. The comprehensive algorithm experiments show that the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed C2G method is reduced by 90.21% compared to the second-best algorithm in the source domain, and its MSE is reduced by an average of 52.11% compared to the best-performing baseline algorithms in each target domain. Additionally, compared to the second-best algorithm in the target domain, C2G reduces the total training time by 59.75% in both the source domain and target domains. The proposed C2G method requires an average of 1.425 ms to predict in specific operating scenario. Finally, 1kW hardware experiments further verify the practical feasibility and superiority of this method."

    "abstract": "In modern warehousing systems, palletizer stack patterns often exhibit issues such as stack pattern deviation and collapse, while edge devices face challenges like limited algorithmic and storage resources. To enhance the accuracy of palletizer stack pattern detection and effectively reduce model size, this study proposes SEML—a lightweight palletizer stack pattern detection model based on YOLOv11n. The backbone incorporates an enhanced ST-CSPDarknet53 architecture to strengthen local feature representation and detection efficiency. The feature fusion stage employs an efficient multi-branch feature fusion network (EMBFPN) to adapt to target scale variations and improve fusion efficiency. Additionally, the output stage introduces a lightweight shared convolution detection head (LPCG), significantly reducing computational load and parameter count while maintaining detection accuracy. Final experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline model, the SEML model achieves a 0.7% increase in average accuracy, a 33% reduction in computational load, a 50% decrease in parameters, and a 44% reduction in model size, while reaching 103.5 FPS. This approach effectively achieves model lightweighting while ensuring high-precision palletizer stack pattern detection, offering excellent real-time performance and strong application potential."

Predicting user interests based on social media content is a crucial task, yet previously assembled datasets based on user interests have limited classifications and can only be used to distinguish coarse-grained interests. In addition, traditional models often rely solely on either text or image data, limiting their predictive accuracy. To solve these problems, we created one multimodal dataset and proposed a multimodal feature fusion model for interest prediction named MFM_IP. First, to provide sufficiently fine-grained data for interest classification, we collected images from 24 classes. Second, we utilized the Google Cloud Vision API to extract keyword text from these images and created a multimodal dataset based on visual and textual data. Finally, to make full use of multimodal features, we extracted visual image and keyword text features and designed a feature enhancement and fusion model to predict user interest based on the processed features. Experimental results showed that the performance of the multimodal interest prediction model proposed in this study was better than those of other existing baseline models."

However, the EEG inverse problem poses a significant challenge in neuroimaging due to its severely ill-posed nature. To address this, we propose a novel framework–dynamic synchronicity graph learning spatiotemporal graph convolutional network (DSG-STGCN). This approach leverages signal synchronization to extract electrode connectivity and employs a graph data augmentation strategy to dynamically correct the adjacency matrix, enhancing the representation of functional connectivity in brain networks. An element-wise spatiotemporal graph convolutional network then models the spatiotemporal dependencies of EEG signals. Additionally, a discrete cosine transform (DCT) projects brain voxel signals into a low-frequency subspace, reducing training parameters. We evaluate DSG-STGCN on synthetic data and real epilepsy datasets. Results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various configurations (isolated and extended sources) and signal-to-noise ratios (0 dB to 20 dB). These findings highlight the potential of DSG-STGCN to advance neuroimaging research and enhance clinical outcomes in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment."

    "abstract": "Community detection in social networks demonstrates a fundamental challenge in network science, driven by the increasing complexity of online platforms. In a given network, a community is a group of nodes that are more solidly linked to each other than the rest of the nodes in the network. One of the most popular methods for detecting communities in a given network is a multi-objective algorithm (MOA). Several approaches based on multi-objective algorithms have been proposed for detecting communities in complex networks. All of them concentrated on improving the quality and efficiency of detection. To achieve a higher quality of community detection, we have proposed a hybrid algorithm that combines NSGA2 and SPEA2 algorithms, with modularity and edge density as two objectives that are optimized simultaneously. By integrating the two algorithms, the proposed method achieves more accurate community detection on some different networks. Moreover, we made some improvements to the initialization method and the crossover operator. We tested the proposed algorithm on ten network datasets of different sizes and compared it to several recent methods using Q-modularity and normalized mutual information (NMI) metrics. The results show that our algorithm finds communities better in several datasets than other algorithms. A multi-criteria technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) analysis also shows that the proposed method always comes out on top across all datasets. This shows that it is strong and strikes a better balance between the accuracy of detection and the quality of community structure."

In doing so, we aim to share passenger transport and last-mile delivery, taking advantage of empty places on shuttles to transport mail baskets optimally filled with parcels. We propose a fast greedy algorithm and a more complex genetic algorithm to solve this problem considering not only the parcels’ size and destination, but also the different shuttles’ stops and onboard space availability. Our results show that the use of this proposal reduces the number of parcels to be delivered by using the traditional postal service, which translates in less road traffic congestion and a more efficient service for customers."

However, severe Doppler shifts and solar scintillation during superior solar conjunction lead to rapidly time-varying channels, making the obtained CSI outdated. To solve this problem, we propose an attention-enhanced gated recurrent unit (Att-GRU)-based channel prediction scheme for deep-space communications. We first establish a time-varying deep-space channel model affected by Doppler shift and solar scintillation. Subsequently, we integrate the attention mechanism into the GRU and propose an Att-GRU-based channel prediction scheme to capture the temporal dependencies in the deep-space channel. By dynamically assigning weights to different time steps, the proposed scheme further improves the model's ability to predict complex channel variations. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed Att-GRU achieves up to 16.5 % normalized mean squared error (NMSE) reduction compared with the GRU model."

    "abstract": "This article proposes a novel heterogeneous semantic and bit communications framework in an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) network, which enables uplink image transmissions from terrestrial user equipments (UEs) to an airborne mobile base station (BS). Semi-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is exploited to serve two categories of UEs, namely bit user equipments (BUEs) and semantic user equipments (SUEs). BUEs transmit critical data with the aim of enhancing conventional bit rate metrics. In contrast, SUEs transmit semantic representations of images compressed by deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC), thus pursuing higher semantic rates. A unified metric termed hybrid semantic-and-bit rate is introduced to evaluate the system performance, which is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, user association, and resource allocation. A proximal policy optimization (PPO) based trajectory optimization and resource allocation (TORA) algorithm is proposed to tackle this NP-hard problem in a time-varying environment. The proposed algorithm enables the UAV to interact with the dynamic environment to explore efficient trajectory planning and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed TORA algorithm achieves a higher hybrid semantic-and-bit rate compared to baseline algorithms under various compression rates (CRs) with fast convergence; and 2) the semi-NOMA transmission scheme achieves superior performance compared to NOMA and time division multiple access (TDMA) transmission schemes under various CRs, even when the number of BUE-SUE user pairs increases."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a subsystem-aware Stackelberg game framework for optimal power control in periodically switched cyber-physical systems (PSCPS) operating over wireless networks under jamming attacks. To account for subsystem switching dynamics, a switching Kalman filter is employed for mode-dependent state estimation, with corresponding error covariance matrices derived for each mode. The impact of switching is quantified using a subsystem-importance-based weighting factor, obtained by analyzing trace variations in the covariance matrices. This factor is integrated into the defender’s utility function to enable adaptive power control. First, a subsystem-aware Stackelberg game model without power constraints is formulated, and the equilibrium strategies of the defender (leader) and the attacker (follower) are obtained via the convex optimization. The framework is then extended to the power-constrained scenario, where feasibility issues arise. By analyzing the boundary and extreme points of the solution space, closed-form equilibrium strategies are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the resilience of PSCPS against jamming attacks in wireless communication environments."

    "abstract": "When vacuum circuit breakers are switched on to connect shunt capacitor banks for reactive power compensation in power systems, pre-breakdown inrush currents occur between the breaker contacts due to system parameters. These high-amplitude, high-frequency inrush currents-manifested as arcing-cause electrical erosion of contact surface materials, leading to degraded insulation performance. Analyzing highfrequency pre-breakdown arcing enables the suppression of circuit inrush parameters within reasonable limits, thereby enhancing the breaker’s capacitive current interruption capability. To investigate the characteristics of high-frequency capacitive current pre-breakdown arcing and its impact on contact surface conditioning, an L-C oscillation test platform was established. High-speed cameras captured and analyzed the pre-breakdown arcing process (plasma). Continuous arc images and post-test electrical erosion results on contact surfaces demonstrate that adjusting inrush current parameters directly influences the spatial expansion range of pre-breakdown arcs and causes varying degrees of surface erosion. Based on these findings, rational control of switching inrush parameters improves the breaker’s capacitive closing capability. This discovery also provides a theoretical foundation for inrush current suppression in reactive power compensation systems within power utilities."

Through federated learning, the multi-modal preprocessing pipeline empowers to effectively consolidate structured and unstructured data sources, while guaranteeing privacy preservation. We also empirically demonstrate the robustness of the framework by performance measurement under different market volatility regimes (low, moderate, high, extreme) and the classification accuracy for sentiment extraction and investment decision prediction at 91.2% and 84.7% high-quality F1-score, respectively. Comparative study yields an annualized return of 14.2% for the proposed method versus 9.2% for the mean-variance optimization, with smaller maximum drawdown (from 11.3% to 18.3%). The adopted system architecture also integrates privacy-preserving approaches to UHNW clients' data, which are computationally efficient.

This new phenomenon is reshaping the entire industry, bringing about significant shifts in how products are marketed and purchased.Consequently, exploring the impact of anchor traits and promotional offers on consumers’ buying decisions in live - streaming e - commerce is of utmost importance. Drawing on the SOR (Stimulus - Organism - Response) theory, this research constructs an all - encompassing theoretical framework. This framework aims to elucidate the process by which consumers’ purchase intentions are formed during live - streaming sessions.This model doesn't just evaluate the credibility and engagement levels of e-commerce hosts. It also takes into account crucial aspects like how products are showcased and the promotional tactics used by sellers. By factoring in the mediating effects of perceived trust and perceived value, the study delves deep into the processes that drive consumers to make their buying choices. It's a comprehensive look at all the elements that come together to influence consumer decisions in the live-streaming shopping space.To ensure the reliability of our research results, we have designed and verified a set of measurement standards specifically for the live e-commerce scene in China. These criteria are carefully crafted to match the unique environment of the live e-commerce market in China, guaranteeing that our research can accurately capture the nuanced characteristics of this dynamic industry.This measurement system does an excellent job of covering all the bases. It zeroes in on key areas like the qualities of the live-streaming hosts, the allure of promotional offers, how customers perceive the value of products, the trust they place in the process, and ultimately, their likelihood of making a purchase. It's a comprehensive way to gauge every factor that goes into a consumer's decision - making during live - streamed shopping sessions.To make sure the data was trustworthy and accurate, instead of relying on the usual SPSS, I chose to use Python for the analysis.To be more precise, the pandas library was utilized to import data from common formats like CSV and Excel, as well as to clean and preprocess it.We did some complex statistical tests, like confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and hypothesis testing. These tests helped us see how different variables were related to each other.The results show that the expertise and engagement of e-commerce live-streamers, as well as how merchants showcase products and offer promotions, greatly boost consumers’ trust in products and make them perceive more value. In fact, these two aspects—consumer trust and perceived value—are the key reasons why streamer traits and promotional features influence whether consumers decide to buy something.This discovery doesn't just show how important live - stream hosts and marketing tactics are in online selling during live streams. It also explains in a clear way the complicated thought processes that make these things affect the way customers act.Also, using Python for analyzing data has made things much faster. Python has a lot of free tools and it's easy to change how you analyze data. These things give good technical help. Because of this, the research results are more accurate and can be repeated easily."

    "abstract": "As deep learning–based Artificial Intelligence (AI) proliferates, model theft and plagiarism pose increasing Intellectual Property (IP) risks. However, watermarking alters model weights and can degrade performance, while fingerprinting often merely verifies uniqueness or requires heavy computation. In this paper, we propose a Neural Network Fingerprinting-based Model Authentication Code (NNFMAC) scheme that verifies both model uniqueness and ownership without affecting performance. NNFMAC extracts key weights from a trained model, applies a median-based method to generate a unique binary fingerprint, and uses this fingerprint as a codebook to encode ownership information via a newly designed index-based function with expansion, producing reliable authentication codes. This non-intrusive approach integrates fingerprinting for uniqueness verification and authentication coding for ownership verification, delivering comprehensive model IP protection while preserving the model’s original performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NNFMAC preserves model accuracy without additional training overhead, unlike other watermarking schemes that degrade accuracy by 0.36%–1.53%. It achieves bit error rates of 0.12 under weight perturbation, 0.03 under fine-tuning, 0.08 under pruning, and 0.09 under weight shifting attacks, which are substantially lower than the 0.51, 0.49, 0.46, and 0.22 reported in prior work, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art schemes in effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness."

    "abstract": "Pruning, as a method of reducing model size and improving performance, has gained increasing traction in recent years. Models such as BERT have been shown to be over-parametrized: multiple attention heads encode the same patterns. Additionally, models trained on general data might underperform on domain-specific tasks, such as recipe interpretation. In this work, we explore the effects of score-based attention head pruning in multilingual transformer models. We conduct our experiments on a dataset comprised of six Indo-European languages with unequal representation across languages, on three tasks of varying difficulty. We grant each attention head a score, based on its contribution to overall model performance, then we evaluate the impact of successive pruning based on said score. Our findings suggest that substantial pruning (up to $80 \\%$) can be performed without major performance loss when applied post-finetuning. We show that easier tasks show slower performance degradation as the percentage of pruned heads increases. We also report consistent reductions in inference time. Contrary to our expectations, low-resource languages did not suffer a significantly faster performance degradation when pruning."

    "abstract": "Polyimide (PI) is a critical insulating material in spacecraft, and its vacuum flashover characteristics are essential for the stable operation of spacecraft. However, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in space can adversely affect the flashover properties of PI. In this study, two commonly used commercial PI films (Kapton-HN and Upilex-S) were subjected to UV irradiation experiments to systematically investigate the impact of UV irradiation on the flashover characteristics of PI films and compare their UV resistance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed the formation of nanoscale pore-like defects, granular substances, and spotty marks on the films’ surface after irradiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated significant changes in the chemical structures of both films post-irradiation. Flashover test results showed that the flashover performance of both films decreased after irradiation, but the reduction was relatively smaller for Upilex-S, demonstrating its superior UV resistance. Additionally, UV irradiation significantly diminishd the number of shallow traps and increased the energy levels of deep traps on the surface of both films, with Upilex-S_UV exhibiting slightly higher trap energy levels than Kapton-HN_UV. These findings provide valuable insights for the application analysis of PI films in space environment."

    "abstract": "The autonomous beekeeping solution provides the possibility to monitor the bee hives from a distance. The distance monitoring opens a floor for new business opportunities, like production of mono-floral honey, as well as more intensive manufacture of honey products. The solution is based on new generation of IoT resources, and deployment of IoT concept in agricultural sector [3; 23; 24; 25]. It is worth noting that physical survey disturbs the bees and causes them stress, which can negatively affect the productivity of the bee colony, as well as taking beekeeper time. In addition, distance does not always allow the beekeeper to react quickly to crisis situations in the apiary. The technology developed in the project allows to use distance monitoring of the beehive, which significantly facilitates the daily life of the beekeeper, allows quick decision-making in critical situations and does not reduce bee productivity, as it does not affect the daily life of the beehive.The beekeeper can observe the apiary remotely and will be able to decide to visit the apiary only if necessary. A great helper is the hive video surveillance system, which will help to monitor the flight activity of bee colonies during the day, as well as to visually assess the condition of the apiary. The new system uses alternative energy sources (solar, wind energy) for the power supply of the system, which increases the possibilities of using the system in distance monitoring on fields."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a spatially selective acoustic signal transmission method using pre-equalization techniques in a two-source, two-receiver setup. By carefully designing the transmitted signals from two acoustic sources, we achieve constructive interference at a desired target location while simultaneously inducing destructive interference at an unintended location. The approach relies on channel pre-equalization based on known channel responses, so the combined signal at one receiver is preserved and intelligible. In contrast, it is significantly suppressed at the other receiving point. Simulations were conducted in MATLAB using synthetically generated channel impulse responses that model multipath propagation and acoustic interference. The results demonstrate the feasibility of spatial signal discrimination through phase and amplitude adjustment at the source level. The method has potential applications in environments requiring targeted acoustic communication, such as underwater communication, focused public address systems, or directional audio messaging. Future work will extend this technique to support the simultaneous transmission of distinct acoustic messages to different spatial locations, thereby enabling multi-user acoustic communication systems with minimal interference."

However, recent cyberattacks have shown the security flaw of current IoT in healthcare environments. Generally, current security solutions based on the classic paradigms of network security cannot adequately face the challenges posed by the particular behaviors of the IoT environments, since most of the protocols that are present show atypical behaviors, and resources are limited. In this sense, it is clear and urgent to create specific tools, methodologies, and datasets for the IoT. In light of the foregoing, we propose a new paradigm to develop context-aware security solutions also suitable for the IoT settings. The solution should be aimed at achieving the goal: Malicious communications detection. Development of open source program IoT-Flock, which can simulate IoT devices benign and malicious, as a base to test and improve IoT security; Development of a utility to convert the collected traffic into standard IoT dataset to be used for further analysis and research; and As a proof of concept, we create an IoT healthcare dataset from benign and attack scenarios. We use several machine learning techniques to analyze the data and detect cyber-attacks, thus fortifying security from threats that might occur in a healthcare system.."

The great majority of individuals in this area rely mostly on agricultural produce for their income, which benefits the whole community. The development of food, which is fundamental for human food, is heavily influenced by ranchers. The sales reps are attempting to decide the right selling cost for the offers they are giving. The misfortunes of this organization outperform its benefits. As indicated by the financial exchange hypothesis referenced above, ranchers are allowed to sell their wares at the most elevated offer cost. Ranchers that sign up in this manner will approach different administrations, including assessments, distributer correspondence, market warnings, and different elements and benefits of a comparable kind.

The proposed framework includes control task space definition and double-closed-loop control based on external force loop approach. Firstly, a specification matrix is designed merely through force feedback to ensure the control task space defined in orthogonal spaces. Then, an orientation compliance controller and a force-motion close-loop controller are constructed in the outer-loop control of external force feedback loop approach. Secondly, the output of outer-loop control task, along with boundary constraints and optimization indexes is formulated as a nolinear dynamic programming problem. Next a finite-time convergence neural network based inner-loop controller is proposed for this category of dynamic programming problem and its stability and convergence analysis are given. Simulations verify the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The real-world experiments show that the Mean Integral of the Absolute Error of the proposed control framework is reduced by 77.26% compared with constant impedance control."

Development of such algorithms and models typically involves a formal evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness and progress beyond the state-of-the-art. Ideally, a thorough evaluation should cover many diverse application scenarios and room-acoustic conditions. However, in practice, evaluation datasets are often limited in size and diversity because they rely on costly and time-consuming measurements. This paper explores how room-acoustic simulations can be used for evaluating ASP/AML algorithms. To this end, we evaluate three ASP/AML algorithms with room-acoustic measurements and data from different simulation engines, and assess the match between the evaluation results obtained from measurements and simulations. The presented investigation compares a numerical wave-based solver with two geometrical acoustics simulators. While numerical wave-based simulations yielded similar evaluation results as measurements for all three evaluated ASP/AML algorithms, geometrical acoustic simulations could not replicate the measured evaluation results as reliably."

It analyzes the outcomes of innovative experiments employing standard techniques to enhance energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission in SWIPT by tackling issues related to size reduction, multi-band functionality, and environmental sustainability. It also examines alternative design methodologies, including metamaterials and sophisticated rectenna designs, capable of attaining higher power conversion efficiencies while minimizing their dimensions. The SWIPT architecture utilized by artificial intelligence (AI)- and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) optimization enhances the performance of SWIPT systems by increasing the reliability of RF-to-DC conversion and communication across varying channel conditions. The results show that flexible and wearable rectifier technologies, when combined with antenna co-design and advanced power management circuits, could enable truly self-powered IoT systems. Such devices would be capable of supporting applications in healthcare monitoring, smart textiles, and industrial sensing, continuous operation without batteries, while also reducing maintenance costs and electronic waste. Finally, we emphasize sustainability and interdisciplinary perspectives, recommending life-cycle assessments to address environmental impact and collaborative approaches that unite circuit, antenna, and protocol design. These reflections identify both the opportunities and bottlenecks that must be addressed for SWIPT rectifiers to enable practical 5G, 6G, and beyond applications."

    "abstract": "This article explores the optimal containment control of discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with the digraph and unknown dynamics under process disturbances. We first demonstrate, through a model transformation, that the mean square bounded containment of MASs can be achieved by guaranteeing the mean square boundedness of the containment error systems. Hence, we can transform the optimal stochastic containment control problem of MASs into a stochastic optimal control problem for containment error systems. Subsequently, utilizing the Bellman optimality principle and the stochastic Lyapunov equation (SLE), we design a model-based policy iteration (PI) algorithm for the optimal stochastic containment control of MASs. This model-based algorithm, by minimizing the cost function in linear quadratic form, enables MASs to achieve mean square bounded containment with the least possible energy input. To circumvent the dependency on the model information, we introduce an online model-free algorithm for the stochastic optimal control problem. The model-free algorithm is developed based on the Q-learning algorithm. Specifically, it uses a historical MAS trajectory to estimate the kernel matrix <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i> of the <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Q</i> function, enabling the resolution of the optimal stochastic containment control problem without model information. To realize the model-free algorithm, the LSTD estimator with bounded bias is employed in the policy evaluation step. We prove the equivalence between the model-free algorithm and the model-based algorithm. Finally, a numerical case is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in achieving the optimal stochastic containment control of MASs."

    "abstract": "Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept drift as a Markov chain and introduce the Stationary Generalization Error to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting concept drift in FL."

Current spectrum allocation methods suffer from exponential computational complexity, extensive information sharing requirements, and poor scalability in dense networks. This paper proposes AMADRL (Attention-based Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework employing dual critic networks with multi-head self-attention mechanisms for intelligent spectrum allocation. The dual critic architecture resolves individual-collective optimization conflicts through local critics for independent entity optimization and a global critic with attention-based coordination. Our approach significantly reduces information sharing requirements while handling heterogeneous QoS demands across diverse entity types. Comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing AMADRL against state-of-the-art baselines including MADDPG, MAAC, QMIX, attention-based methods (A-DDPG, MHA-DQN), and game-theoretic approaches reveals that AMADRL achieves superior performance across multiple metrics including spectrum utilization efficiency, interference mitigation, and network scalability, while preserving user privacy and satisfying strict latency constraints required by safety-critical and industrial use cases."

    "abstract": "Renewable energy has become a viable alternative to fossil fuels owing to its environmental benefits. However, its inherent uncertainty pose significant challenges. Demand response mechanisms have been developed to address these issues, facilitating renewable energy integration through consumer-side flexible resources. However, these mechanisms often affect consumer satisfaction, necessitating precise measurement and control of these impacts. In this paper, we propose a two-stage electricity trading and load dispatch optimization model aimed at reducing carbon emission by promoting renewable energy accommodation, and the proposed optimization model takes into account multi-category energy consumer satisfaction. We begin by classifying consumers into distinct categories and designing tailored satisfaction functions that reflect their unique power consumption preferences. The electricity trading and load dispatch processes are formulated as a two-stage optimization problem, which is then transformed into Markov decision processes. A model-free framework applying two state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms is proposed to solve the optimization problem without requiring complex environmental modeling and prior knowledge. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark algorithms regarding both consumer satisfaction preservation and carbon emission reduction."

    "abstract": "In this article, a novel seven-pole miniaturized monoblock dielectric resonator (MDR) bandpass filter (BPF) using a multiple-function resonator (MFR) is proposed. Except for the quasi-TEM mode generated by the traditional metalized blind cylindrical hole (called Type-I resonator), a novel resonant mode generated by the metalized blind wall-shaped holes (called MFR) is introduced and discussed in detail. MFR demonstrates additional functionalities of frequency-constant coupling control by modifying resonator shape and size, reducing inter-resonator coupling strength when coupled with a Type-I resonator, and serving as an inherently isolated metallic wall. Such novel coupling mechanisms are then used to construct inline-shape cascaded triplet (CT) units with lower band and upper band transmission zeros (TZs). Then, a seven-pole 2.5-GHz BPF with 160 MHz bandwidth and three TZs is synthesized and designed. These three TZs are separately produced by three CT units with flexible TZ adjustment. The reuse of the resonant mode as the connecting node in different CT units can reduce the number of resonant modes, while also reducing the overall size and insertion loss (IL).

    "abstract": "Fake news data, often sampled from the same communities, results in the veracity of news being highly correlated with certain textual and visual entities. This correlation leads fake news classification models to be prone to shortcut learning, quickly overfitting by capturing only shallow spurious correlations between labels and features. Consequently, neural networks trained on such data suffer from poor generalization and potential misclassification under distribution shifts. To address these critical challenges and enhance the robustness of fake news detection, in this paper, we propose a DIsentanglement-based Causality-awarE fake news detection method (DICE). DICE introduces a novel paradigm that moves beyond merely mitigating known correlations or relying on predefined bias categories. Specifically, DICE dynamically constructs multimodal news into a graph neural network, employing learnable node and edge mask disentanglers to effectively model and separate genuine causal relationships from spurious correlations between multimodal features and veracity labels. To reinforce this disentanglement process, we design a novel optimization framework that minimizes extrapolation risk and enforces representation orthogonality, leading to robust disentangled causal and biased representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves superior performance on five large-scale fake news detection benchmarks. Additionally, our evaluation on a heavily biased fake news dataset demonstrates DICE’s strong generalization, suggesting its potential to inform a new paradigm in causal fake news detection.

    "abstract": "Efficient 6-DoF grasp pose detection is a fundamental and challenging task in robotic manipulation. Existing methods mainly rely on the geometric features of point clouds to synthesise 6-DoF grasp poses, as point clouds contain rich geometric information. However, the rich visual cues contained in images, such as object edges, textures, and other fine-grained details, can also serve as important references. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient multimodal 6-DoF grasp pose detection algorithm that also integrates object-centric receptive fields. Specifically, we design an early fusion strategy to integrate point cloud and image information, providing more discriminative multimodal features for grasp pose detection. Furthermore, an object-centric receptive fields module based on grounded segment anything model (Grounded-SAM) is introduced, which provides global references for each point during the grasp parameter decoding stage. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance on the GraspNet-1Billion dataset. Compared with baseline, the AP improves by 7.44, 8.42, and 2.37 in Seen, Similar, and Novel scenes, respectively. To test the model's robustness to image noise, we designed a series of noise experiments, demonstrating the model's strong anti-interference ability. Finally, we deployed the algorithm on a Franka robot and conducted extensive grasping experiments, achieving a high grasp success rate."

We introduce a novel and operationally meaningful privacy measure called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pointwise maximal cost</i> (PMC) and demonstrate that imposing an upper bound on PMC is equivalent to enforcing a lower bound on the information density. PMC quantifies the information leakage about a secret to adversaries who aim to minimize non-negative cost functions after observing the outcome of a privacy mechanism. When restricted to finite alphabets, PMC can equivalently be defined as the information leakage to adversaries aiming to minimize the probability of incorrectly guessing randomized functions of the secret. We study the properties of PMC and apply it to standard privacy mechanisms to demonstrate its practical relevance. Through a detailed examination, we connect PMC with other privacy measures that impose upper or lower bounds on the information density. These are pointwise maximal leakage (PML), local differential privacy (LDP), and (asymmetric) local information privacy. In particular, we show that a mechanism satisfies LDP if and only if it has both bounded PMC and bounded PML. Overall, our work fills a conceptual and operational gap in the taxonomy of privacy measures, bridges existing disconnects between different frameworks, and offers insights for selecting a suitable notion of privacy in a given application."

    "abstract": "Influence maximization in cyber-physical social systems has an important application background in the field of viral marketing. It attracts extensive research in academic and industrial communities. The state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms estimate the influence of users on the sampled sub-networks. However, with the explosive growth in data resources of cyber-physical social systems, the generation of these samples becomes expensive. In addition, most existing influence maximization methods rely on the Euclidean space, considering in general only the semantic similarities between users and ignoring the hierarchical relationships between them. In practice though, social networks are hierarchical. Therefore, this study focuses on the influence maximization in the hyperbolic space. Specifically, a hyperbolic influence prediction model is presented, whereby the influence probabilities between users are modeled by incorporating a graph attention network into a hyperbolic GraphSAGE model. Based on influence probabilities, a weighted bipartite network is constructed, and a seed set is found by employing a greedy approach. Finally, numerical experimental studies on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of influence spread and running time, but also outperforms its Euclidean counterpart."

To solve it, we propose a channel selection method for hearing aid applications using remote microphones. The proposed channel selection method relies on the observation that the hearing aid user tends to look at the target talker and uses the user’s head-steering direction to identify the remote channel. We pose the channel selection task as a multiple hypothesis testing problem, and derive a maximum likelihood solution. Under realistic, simplifying assumptions, the solution selects the remote channel which has the highest weighted squared absolute correlation coefficient with the output of the head-steered hearing aid beamformer. We analyze the performance of the proposed channel selection method using close-talking remote microphones and table microphone arrays. Through simulations using realistic acoustic scenes, we show that the proposed channel selection method consistently outperforms existing methods in accurately finding the remote channel that captures the target talker signal, in the presence of multiple competing talkers, without the use of any additional sensors."

In the specific scenario of industrial control systems experiencing abrupt temperature disturbances and cyber infection dynamics, conventional methods relying on static thresholds and SIS models fail to deliver optimal stability. In this paper, we propose the real-time adaptive reconfiguration algorithm (RTARA), which integrates temperature-dependent SIR modeling, spectral graph theory, and an adaptive gossip framework to dynamically adjust communication protocols and trigger network reconfiguration when a critical threshold is breached. Our implementation employs a momentum-based gradient descent update enhanced with a recursive composite operator, achieving rapid convergence as evidenced by an MSE reduction from 0.045 to 0.012, a convergence rate improvement from 0.020 to 0.004, and a decrease in adaptation latency from 2.5 s to 0.5 s. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances network stability, with a stability index increasing from 0.70 to 0.95, thereby confirming its superior performance."

    "abstract": "Reliable detection of seismic events from continuous waveform data remains a major challenge due to variations in sensor performance and recording quality across seismic networks. Conventional deep learning models assume uniformly high quality input, which often leads to degraded performance and unstable confidence estimates under noisy conditions. This paper proposes a data quality aware deep learning framework that integrates waveform reliability directly into the detection process. Each waveform is assigned to a scalar quality score derived from measurable indicators such as signal to noise ratio, glitch fraction, and clipping fraction. The score is used as both an auxiliary input feature and a weighting factor in the loss function, allowing the network to emphasize reliable data while maintaining robustness to noise. The model is implemented using a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network and evaluated on onset waveforms from the Southern California Seismic Network. The proposed framework achieves an average precision and ROC–AUC of 0.989 and an F1 score of 0.949, outperforming baseline CNNs that disregard waveform quality. Stratified analysis shows stable performance across varying quality levels, and calibration evaluation demonstrates well-aligned predicted probabilities. The approach provides a transparent and interpretable method for improving reliability in automated seismic monitoring and can be readily extended to other sensor-based detection applications."

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes integration and coordination gains in dense millimeter-wave ISAC networks through a dual-mode framework that combines monostatic and multistatic sensing. A comprehensive system-level analysis is conducted, accounting for base station (BS) density, power allocation, antenna misalignment, radar cross-section (RCS) fluctuations, clutter, bistatic geometry, channel fading, and self-interference cancellation (SIC) efficiency. Using stochastic geometry, coverage probabilities and ergodic rates for sensing and communication are derived, revealing trade-offs among BS density, beamwidth, and power allocation. It is shown that the communication performance sustained reliable operation despite the overlaid sensing functionality. In addition, the results reveal the foundational role of spatial sensing diversity, driven by the dual-mode operation, to compensate for the weak sensing reflections and vulnerability to imperfect SIC along with interference and clutter. To this end, we identify a system transition from monostatic to multistatic-dominant sensing operation as a function of the SIC efficiency. In the latter case, using six multistatic BSs instead of a single bistatic receiver improved sensing coverage probability by over 100%, highlighting the coordination gain. Moreover, comparisons with pure communication networks confirm substantial integration gain. Specifically, dual-mode networked sensing with four cooperative BSs can double throughput, while multistatic sensing alone improves throughput by over 50%."

    "abstract": "As a variant of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the partial AUC (PAUC) focuses on a specific range of false positive rate (FPR) and/or true positive rate (TPR) in the ROC curve. It is a pivotal evaluation metric in real-world scenarios with both class imbalance and decision constraints. However, selecting instances within these constrained intervals during its calculation is NP-hard, and thus typically requires approximation techniques for practical resolution. Despite the progress made in PAUC optimization over the last few years, most existing methods still suffer from uncontrollable approximation errors or a limited scalability when optimizing the approximate PAUC objectives. In this paper, we close the approximation gap of PAUC optimization by presenting two simple instance-wise minimax reformulations: one with an asymptotically vanishing gap, the other with the unbiasedness at the cost of more variables. Our key idea is to first establish an equivalent instance-wise problem to lower the time complexity, simplify the complicated sample selection procedure by threshold learning, and then apply different smoothing techniques. Equipped with an efficient solver, the resulting algorithms enjoy a linear per-iteration computational complexity w.r.t. the sample size and a convergence rate of O(ε<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1/3</sup>) for typical one-way and two way PAUCs. Moreover, we provide a tight generalization bound of our minimax reformulations.

    "abstract": "Mental stress poses a significant global health burden, with rising prevalence linked to impaired cognitive functioning, reduced productivity, and increased neuropsychiatric risk. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive approach for capturing neural correlates of stress; however, effective classification remains challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal nature of brain activity. To address the limitations of current EEG-based stress classification methods, particularly their limited ability to jointly model temporal, spectral, and spatial dependencies. We propose a novel handcrafted feature-extraction framework, Spatiotemporal Connectivity and Fractal–Spectral Profile (STC-FSP). The framework integrates handcrafted descriptors from four domains, temporal, spectral, fractal, and spatial connectivity (including inter-channel correlation, hemispheric asymmetry, and phase-lag index) to capture both localized neural dynamics and inter-regional synchronization. To enhance cross-domain interaction and reduce redundancy, a log-transformed Pearson correlation is applied across the feature space. The proposed STC-FSP framework was evaluated on the publicly available DASPS dataset using multiple classical machine learning models. In binary classification, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved the highest accuracy (93.18%), F1-score (93.89%), and AUC (93.89%), while in multiclass classification, XGBoost yielded competitive accuracy with an exceptionally low inference time of 0.0015 s, demonstrating real-time feasibility. Compared with existing EEG-based stress classification methods such as Baghdadi et al. (2019) (83.5% using Autoencoder), Syakiyla et al. (2023) (89.5% with S-LSMOTE), and Shikha et al. (2025) (NMI–RFE with Random Forest, 90.76%), the proposed STC-FSP achieves up to 16%–20% higher accuracy with significantly lower inference latency (~0.05s), confirming its superiority in both accuracy and computational efficiency. By fusing multi-domain descriptors and emphasizing low latency, the proposed approach is particularly suited to resource-constrained mental health monitoring applications. This study demonstrates the efficacy of interpretable handcrafted EEG features and log-correlation modelling for stress recognition."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, increasing digitalization may give acoustic communication an essential role in areas where electromagnetic communication fails or can only be employed with extensive effort. Consequently, acoustic communication systems need to address the challenges of real-world applications. One key requirement are the limited energy resources that battery-powered sensor nodes possess. Besides the high energy consumption during transmission and reception, listening to the communication channel for synchronization between transmitter and receiver is a major energy consuming factor. For this purpose, we introduce a concept of wake-up receivers for acoustic communication systems, originally known from radio technology. Therefore, this contribution presents a concept of a low-power acoustic wake-up receiver implemented with a demonstrator through a 1.6 mm thick metal barrier.We exploit two fundamental resonance modes of a piezoelectric disc transducer to facilitate an acoustic wake-up. The radial vibration mode at 220 kHz enables frequency-based wake-up with a sensitivity of –87 dBm and a radial distance of 1.35 m. The thickness extension mode at 1.2 MHz generates a 100 kHz subcarrier to transmit an 8-bit Manchester-coded ID at 1.1 kbps, achieving a sensitivity of –37 dBm. Both wake-up schemes have been demonstrated to function reliably with an energy consumption of 14.3 μW."

    "abstract": "Distributed secondary control enhances the reliability of networked microgrids with high-penetration distributed generators (DGs) through its decentralized structure and flexible communication mechanisms. However, it typically requires each DG to continuously communicate with neighboring DGs within a small fixed sampling period, resulting in both excessive communication burdens and increased risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To solve these problems, this article proposes a novel robust distributed dynamic event-triggered (ET) secondary control strategy for networked microgrids under DoS attacks. First, to compensate the frequency and voltage deviations caused by primary control, a novel distributed secondary controller based on ET is proposed, which not only achieves accurate active power sharing, but also reduces communication burden. Second, to address the inaccurate distribution of reactive power caused by ET secondary control, the adaptive virtual impedance is introduced, which can dynamically adjust the virtual impedance based on real-time system condition to improve power-sharing accuracy. Third, considering the impact of DoS attacks, the linear active disturbance rejection control method is introduced, which can dynamically adjust control input to mitigate the adverse impact of DoS attacks. Then, a novel Lyapunov function is constructed to analyze the stability of the proposed control method, which is rigorously proven to be free from Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation results."

The impact of temporal resolution was evaluated by varying the number of input frames per clip (25, 40, 60). The experimental results show that increased temporal input consistently improves classification performance, with the MoViNet A2 model achieving the highest accuracy of 98.3% at 60 frames. However, this improvement comes with a substantial increase in computational cost. Among the evaluated models, MoViNet A1 demonstrated the most optimal trade-off, achieving 96.7% accuracy while maintaining moderate computational demands.

However, they frequently lack mechanisms for fine-grained emotion control due to the scarcity of labeled resources. The current work proposes a method for adjusting F5-TTS [1] in order to achieve fine-grained emotion control by fine-tuning under low-resource conditions, while aiming to keep the original model’s performance. To enforce the newly added condition, the classifier-free guidance (CFG) mechanism is modified by adding a supplementary term that amplifies the condition’s contribution, at the expense of increased inference time. We show that the proposed method is able to generate natural and intelligible speech with the same voice as the reference audio, but with changed emotion according to the label condition. Moreover, this method enables control over emotion intensity, despite the model not being explicitly trained for this task. Extensive automated evaluations and subjective tests with 20 human participants demonstrate that our method maintains intelligibility, naturalness and allows both emotion class and intensity control.Implementation code and demo samples are available at https://github.com/RaduBolbo/F5-TTS-Emotional-CFG"

Investigating the contact erosion characteristics is crucial for the development of vacuum circuit breakers. A contact erosion model under vacuum arc conditions has been established, considering the melting and erosion process of contact materials under different force mechanisms. To analyze the heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena within the contact molten pool, a level-set model incorporating evaporation and splashing has been developed to track phase-change interfaces and simulate the entire erosion process of contact metal during vacuum arc erosion. The study analyzes the characteristics of contact erosion vacuum arc circuit breakers, aiming to identify methods for reducing contact erosion. The results indicate that as the arc energy increases, the form of molten splashing transitions from fluid-dynamics-based splashing along the sides of the molten pool wall to explosive splashing perpendicular to the molten layer surface. Additionally, the rate of molten splashing increases with the arc energy, while the vortices formed within the molten layer are the primary cause of the irregularities on the inner wall of the molten pool."

    "abstract": "The Low-frequency power transmission technology has great potential in offshore wind power transmission. Switchgear equipment is the key component of the lowfrequency power transmission systems. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the eco-friendly vacuum circuit breaker has caused many concerns. However, there is still few research on the operating overvoltage of vacuum circuit breakers in low-frequency systems. Moreover, compared with the power-frequency system, the topology of the low-frequency system is more complex, including the M3C frequency converters and offshore wind turbines and other components. The influence of these key parts on overvoltage is still not very clear. Besides, overvoltage has a crucial impact on the interruption of vacuum circuit breakers. In response to the above issues, the causes of overvoltage in a low-frequency power transmission system were investigated. Based on the typical topology of offshore wind power low-frequency power transmission, a typical low-frequency power transmission system model is built. Subsequently, the distribution characteristics and evolution process of vacuum circuit breaker operating overvoltage in low-frequency and powerfrequency systems were analyzed."

    "abstract": "Vacuum DC circuit breakers attract attention because of their advantages; fast operation speed and fire resistance. However, the low voltage of vacuum arcs and complex external circuits remain challenges. In this study, a transverse magnetic field (TMF) was applied to extend the arc length at the electrode ends, increasing arc voltage and enabling interruption using only the vacuum interrupter. The effects of electrode material properties were reflected primarily in magnetic driving time. AgWCCo material, with its superior evaporation characteristics and high thermal conductivity, demonstrated superior cutting performance in DC interruption under TMF application, while CuW material performed poorly. Fast interruption requires rapid arc drive to the electrode edge and rapid cooling of electrode temperature to prevent restrikes."

    "abstract": "The triggering characteristics of laser-triggered vacuum switches (LTVS) are significantly influenced by the parameters of the laser-generated initial plasma. An experimental setup was constructed to measure the initial plasma current, and the effects of laser energy, ranging from 10 mJ to 25 mJ, and gap distance, from 2.5 mm to 10 mm, on the initial plasma current characteristics of LTVS were investigated. The results reveal that the initial plasma current waveform exhibits an oscillatory decay. The initial charge, calculated by integrating the initial plasma current, increases rapidly with laser energy from 10 mJ to 20 mJ but slows after 20 mJ, which might be explained by the plasma shielding effects. At 20 mJ, the initial charge reaches 42.18 nC, with the initial plasma current peaking at 61.28 ns. Variations in the gap distance also affect the peak time and initial charge. As the gap distance increases from 2.5 mm to 10 mm, the peak time of the initial plasma current increases from 51.92 ns to 57.84 ns, while the initial charge decreases from 26.91 nC to 21.78 nC."

Some benefit from real-time support from family members, while others prefer self-paced, asynchronous help. To meet their diverse needs, I propose two solutions: HelpCall and SoftBox. HelpCall provides synchronous guidance through an assistive video overlay, helping older adults follow instructions from remote family members. In contrast, to support asynchronous assistance, SoftBox generates guided interactive software mockups from screencast demonstrations to allow learners to independently explore and learn new features in a sandbox-like environment. Through user studies with older adults and their family members, these projects offer complementary insights into synchronous and asynchronous support, advancing accessible technology for diverse learning needs and contexts and moving toward universal accessibility in digital tools."

    "abstract": "This study proposed an isolated high-step-up DC-DC converter with an interleaved coupled-inductor scheme and active-clamped technique for renewable energy systems. In the proposed converter, an interleaved-boost structure is adopted on the primary side to reduce input current ripple and achieve a higher voltage gain. Moreover, the design of active-clamped circuits reduces the voltage stresses on the active switches, and they recycle stray currents from the leakage inductance to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) turn-on capability for each active switch. Since the voltage stresses on active switches are decreased, semiconductor switching components with lower turn-on resistance (R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DS-ON</sub>) can be selected to reduce conduction losses. In a conventional interleaved boost structure, two separate magnetic cores are typically required for the two input inductors. In this study, a magnetic core integration approach is adopted, allowing both input inductors to share a common core. Therefore, their current ripples can be reduced while avoiding the risk of local core saturation so that the utilization of the magnetic core can be improved. A laboratory prototype with an input voltage of 25V, an output voltage of 400V, and a 2kW maximum power is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter. According to experimental results, the maximum power conversion efficiency reaches above 97%."

    "abstract": "Preference alignment has achieved greater success on large language models (LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we propose <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LPO4Rec</small>, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training. Specifically, we derive a closed-form optimal policy to enable more efficient and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations. Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation."

Three complementary contributions are then offered for such a scenario. The first is a method to estimate the translation vector between the center points of both rigid bodies, which unlike existing techniques does not require that both objects have the same shape or even the same number of landmark points. This technique is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art (SotA) under complete information, but to be sensitive to data erasures, even when enhanced by matrix completion methods. The second contribution, designed to offer improved performance in the presence of incomplete information, offers a robust alternative to the latter, at the expense of a slight relative loss under complete information. Finally, the third contribution is a scheme for the estimation of the rotation matrix describing the relative orientation of the target rigid body with respect to the primary. Comparisons of the proposed schemes and SotA techniques demonstrate the advantage of the contributed methods in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) performance under fully complete information and incomplete conditions."

Specifically, an output-feedback finite-time neural predictor is proposed to identify both model uncertainties and unknown state information. Subsequently, a distributed path-guided herding control strategy is designed, including patrolling, gathering, enclosing, and expelling. Control barrier functions are formulated as safety constraints, and a quadratic optimization problem is established. By using the neurodynamic optimization to solve the optimization problem, the optimal control law satisfying both safety constraints and state constraints is generated. Furthermore, a dynamic event-triggered communication method is proposed to reduce unnecessary communication, especially during the transient phase. By using the proposed herding control approach, the collision-free herding is guaranteed for input-to-state stability, and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."

In recent years, affective recognition has gained substantial attention owing to its broad potential for enhancing human–computer interactions. Contrary to conventional approaches that frequently overlook the intrinsic relationships between different modalities and mostly rely on a single modality, this study presents a differential multimodal transformer with an end-to-end multimodal affective state recognition framework that integrates heterogeneous data sources. The architecture is organized into three parts: a differential multi-scale feature extractor (DMFE) module to align signals and emphasize meaningful temporal changes, a global cross-attention encoder (GCE) to model relationships across modalities, and difference-augmented weighted fusion (DWF) to merge features by applying two self-attention pooling layers to highlight the fused representation, which is then fed to the classifier. Specifically, on the DEAP dataset, the model achieved 94.23% (valence) and 93.91% (arousal) accuracies with corresponding F1-scores of 94.89% and 94.92%. In WESAD, the framework attained 94.63% accuracy and a 93.82% F1-score. Performance on CogLoad reached 92.08% accuracy and 92.91% F1-score, while on MOCAS, it achieved 92.04% accuracy and a 91.89% F1-score. The results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture over existing models. Furthermore, ablation studies have confirmed the individual contributions and significance of core architectural components."

The calibration model for these devices is one of the key drivers of overall performance. Field calibration is increasingly recognized as the best approach for calibrating air quality monitoring devices. However, to achieve high-quality calibration results, low-cost sensors must be co-located with reference stations. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive solution that leverages self-supervised pretraining on LCS data to learn meaningful representations for pollution data calibration. In the first stage, our model undergoes unsupervised pretraining inspired by masked autoencoders. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning is applied to enhance the accuracy of pollution data calibration. Additionally, we introduce a novel architecture that combines state-space models, specifically Mamba, with Transformer layers. Our model is rigorously evaluated on two publicly available research datasets, consistently outperforming all baseline methods. Furthermore, we present a newly designed ESP32 microcontroller based system to validate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that our calibration technique is well-suited for microcontrollers with limited resources, significantly reducing the cost of IoT solutions for air quality and pollution monitoring."

    "abstract": "As robots integrate into human society, ensuring safe robot-environment interaction, particularly in the event of collisions, has emerged as a growing design priority. A promising solution is introducing proper compliance into existing rigid robots, akin to musculoskeletal systems, to absorb impacts in various directions. However, mimicking longitudinal compliance seen in biological joints to absorb compressive impacts along limbs, such as the role of cartilages like menisci, remains a challenge shadowed by the complexity of joint architecture. Here, exploring and adapting the elastic longitudinal movement structure of knee, we incorporated traditional mechanical hinges with a compact buffer structure to enable both simple rotational motion and effective longitudinal impact absorption. Under longitudinal loading, the buffer structure functions as a mechanism transmitting the limited compression to amplified deformations of elastic elements, thus producing resistance against load. The resistive load-displacement relationship is tailorable by tuning diverse elastic components, allowing for a high-static-low-dynamic stiffness to improve energy absorption efficiency. Drop tests and walking robot demonstrations confirm that the proposed knee-inspired hinge not only mitigates acceleration transmitted to the robot's main body but also reduces ground reaction forces, thereby improving robot-environment interaction safety. This work highlights the design paradigm of adapting natural solutions to mechanical systems, and holds potential for direct integration into diverse robots, exoskeletons, and prostheses."

    "abstract": "The parallel installation of vacuum interrupters (VIs) is an effective approach to enhance the current interruption capacity of direct current circuit breakers (DCCBs). However, parallel configurations pose challenges in achieving balanced current distribution between branches during the arcing process. In this study, a 40 kV mechanical DCCB equipped with two parallel VIs in the main branch is constructed, where each VI is operated independently by their own mechanism. A series of DC current interruption experiments is conducted to investigate the current sharing characteristic and its influence on interruption performance. The results reveal that the current-sharing condition prior to the injection of high-frequency current critically influences the subsequent artificial current zero behavior. In scenarios with poor initial current sharing, the VIs interrupt sequentially, with zero-crossing time deviations on the order of tens of microseconds. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for current-sharing dynamics when coordinating the operation of DCCBs with parallel VIs."

    "abstract": "Circuit breakers fitted with Vacuum Interrupters are type tested according to international standards, with the most prevalent being the relevant IEC and IEEE standards. For the DC time constant of the rated short-circuit breaking current during asymmetrical current switching tests, the standard value of 45ms is typically used. While some special case time constants are mentioned in the standards, they are not used for tests unless specifically requested. In recent years more applications are seen where Vacuum Circuit Breakers are directly connected to large Power Transformers, (small) generators, or motor buses with large Medium-Voltage motors. Consequently, the standard DC time constant often does not suffice. Power-system analysis software is capable to accurately calculate the actual breaker requirements in the system, but the results rarely match the tested breaker data. Comparing analysis results with circuit-breaker nameplate information or test data from manufacturers is challenging for many. This paper addresses the derating of Vacuum Circuit Breakers when applied in networks with DC time constants (or X/R-ratios) that differ from those the circuit breaker was originally tested with. Various derating methods will be discussed along with their pros and cons."

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which employ distributed access points (APs) to serve all users, have emerged as a promising solution for massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC). However, the signal propagation delay caused by its distributed architecture at AP side is significantly different, which interacts with the initial time offset caused by low-cost oscillators at user side to form multi-source asynchronous effect in cell-free systems. This asynchronous effect destroys pilot orthogonality and causes phase distortion, resulting in huge energy loss and access delay. To systematically characterize the this effects, this paper first establishes a comprehensive model for cell-free multi-source asynchronous effect and derives minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation, thus revealing the critical issues of pilot orthogonality destruction and phase-shift matrix-induced interference. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) and decoding error probability. Finally, we propose a novel asynchronous compensation framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) for adaptive transmission time adjustment and optimized receive vector design. Theoretical simulation investigates the adverse effects of the multi-source asynchronous effect based on different key parameters. Numerical results demonstrate that our MADRL-based framework achieves superior SE and access success probability, effectively compensating asynchronous impairments and proving particularly suitable for mURLLC requirements."

    "abstract": "The growing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has led to a significant reduction in power system inertia, posing challenges for grid stability. Unlike traditional power systems, which rely on physical inertia, modern microgrids (MGs) require virtual inertia support from external energy sources such as energy storage systems (ESSs). Electric vehicles (EVs) can be utilized as existing energy resources to improve inertial response, thereby minimizing the need for additional ESS and associated costs. To meet the demand of inertia, this paper introduces a novel fixed-time integral sliding mode virtual inertia and damping (FxT-ISM-VID) control strategy, designed to enhance frequency stability in multiarea MG that typically lack synchronous generation. A key feature of the proposed controller is its ability to quickly resolve frequency deviations within a predefined time frame, regardless of the initial system conditions. This ensures accelerated and predictable stabilization times. Moreover, the ISM control provides robustness against model uncertainties, fluctuations in RESs generation, and system parametric variations. A thorough analysis using Lyapunov based method is developed to validate the stability of the designed control strategy within a fixed time. Simulation and HIL results of a two-area interconnected MG with stochastic load-generation variations, nonlinear generation, and realistic communication delays validate the effectiveness of the proposed FxT-ISM-VID control approach. It outperforms existing strategies, achieving an 87.6% reduction in frequency deviation, 86.56% faster stabilization time, and significant improvements in tie-line power fluctuations during heavy load integration."

The mixed-methods approach combining bibliometric mapping and thematic analysis identified five core domains: actor interaction, framework development, entrepreneurship, efficiency and effectiveness, and historical perspectives. The findings delineate the state of the art, while simultaneously exposing underlying divergences and conceptual lacunae. These gaps are articulated through a set of prospective research questions, systematically organised by model perspectives, actors, and salient characteristics. Findings confirm the predominance of the Triple Helix, while highlighting theoretical limitations that have motivated the development of higher-order models. Although the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices introduce societal and ecological dimensions, their operationalisation remains limited. On this basis, the study advances a structured synthesis designed not only to orient subsequent scholarly inquiry but also to enhance the practical deployment of innovation helix models in engineering and technology management."

    "abstract": "We present a dual-locking method for securing trained neural networks, combining key-driven index permutation with PIN-based watermarking via Sparse Quantization Index Modulation (QIM). To incorporate cryptographic randomness into the locking mechanism, we independently apply a uniform random permutation to every row of the adaptively selected index vectors. The second stage embeds a robust, blind binary watermark into the bias coefficients, modulating its quantized values, and binding the network to a user-defined Personal Identification Number (PIN). Without the correct key, the network retains its architecture, but becomes functionally impaired due to disrupted internal representations. Unlocking is achieved through inverse permutation, fully restoring model accuracy. Simultaneously, the embedded watermark remains imperceptible, concealed within the host bias structure without affecting functionality. Upon extraction, it verifies the key association and confirms model authorship. To enhance both robustness and recoverability, we apply an adaptive key selection strategy that redistributes highmagnitude weights to low-sensitivity positions and vice versa. This maximizes degradation when locked, while ensuring full recovery when unlocked. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K using fully connected networks, ResNet Convo-lutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer architectures demonstrate that our method sharply reduces accuracy when locked to below 10& and even 0.5& for CNNs, while fully restoring it with the correct key. The embedded watermark does not degrade performance and reliably authenticates ownership. Embedding analysis across transformers and CNNs reveals the method’s diagnostic potential, where characteristic shifts in embedding distributions may indicate undertraining or suboptimal design. Overall, this approach offers strong protection and traceability for neural network models."

Self-supervised molecular pretraining can leverage large unlabeled datasets, reducing dependence on extensive annotations. However, most methods struggle to preserve domain-specific chemical knowledge, especially clinically relevant substructures such as motifs. Random masking and generic graph augmentations often degrade critical chemical information and harm interpretability. Many approaches also work at a single scale-either atom or motif-missing opportunities for cross-scale integration. We propose A2M-Mol, a multi-perspective molecular pretraining framework that combines atom-level and motif-level views through four parallel graph constructions. This design enables cross-view alignment and multiscale fusion, explicitly encoding chemical knowledge. A2M-Mol employs a suite of self-supervised tasks, including cross-view correspondence, atomic reconstruction, global topology modeling, and property constraint enforcement, all coordinated via tailored contrastive learning. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone architectures show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies confirm strong synergies among the tasks. A2M-Mol maintains robust predictive accuracy across data scales, demonstrating effectiveness for real-world molecular property prediction and potential to accelerate drug discovery."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the issues of high rates of student attrition and the paucity of explainability of predictive models in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) by proposing a framework for predicting student attrition based on an Explainable Relational Graph Convolutional Network (ERGCN). The model captures co-learning relationships among students and latent associations between courses by constructing a multidimensional relationship between students, courses, and behaviors. The proposed approach incorporates a dynamic temporal segmentation method with a 10-day cycle, in conjunction with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to extract fine-grained behavioral sequence features. The experimental results demonstrate that the validation based on the xuetangx data set indicates that ERGCN exhibits a remarkable predictive effect on the dropout ofMOOCstudents in higher education, with an F1 value of 92.56±0.04% and an AUC value of 88.84±0.03%. In comparison with the conventional benchmark model (logistic regression and support vector machine), the absolute enhancement of the AUC is 10.31-19.33 percentage points, and the relative enhancement is 13.1% -27.8%. The study utilizes an explainability module analysis to identify the key factors that influence dropout. The study provides MOOC platforms with a prediction tool that combines high accuracy and transparency. This facilitates the implementation of customized intervention strategies by educators for students who are at risk. For instance, they can prioritize the delivery of customized learning resources to the top 10% of students with the highest probability of dropping out. The present research proffers methodological references for relationship graph modeling and explainable artificial intelligence in the context of educational data mining."

To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage learning framework, where an initial pre-trained policy is extended with a second set of networks, aiming to correct the base agent's knowledge and preserve its behavior. Both modules are trained with the conventional RL loop, while the second learning system is also faced with an increased number of training samples from those problematic scenarios to provide more exploration possibilities across them. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework on various environments from the robotic and vehicle control domains. The results showed that the final agent demonstrates improved performance and can successfully complete a broader range of scenarios compared to the baseline agents, while also maintaining the control quality."

By leveraging the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), stacked sparse autoencoders, and choice-level fusion techniques, the framework adeptly procedures complicated spectral-spatial information inherent in urban landscapes. The method begins with the extraction of deep functions, utilising the combined spectral-spatial statistics, accompanied by means of class through a tender-choice classifier.

    "abstract": "There are many security risks as computer and communication technologies continue to advance. To reduce these worries, several different kinds Numerous processes with cyber-security enabled have been developed. Anomaly detection is one of these methods. Finding anomalies involves employing a variety of approaches and procedures to identify various patterns that do not adhere to predetermined characteristics of the entire body of data. Deep learning techniques have recently been accepted as an adequate option due to their capacity to take data properties directly from the data. Convolution neural network (CNN) is employed primarily because it can handle input with many dimensions. This study offers a thorough analysis of the use of CNN as a primary tool for anomaly identification. The majority of the known remedies have been compiled and categorized in the literature. Additionally, this research provides a bound together cross framework that mimics complete anomaly detection methods that were previously offered examinations, as per the information source. In-depth assessment from a brought together cross system upgrades this paper’s top to bottom conversation of how CNN is utilized in the writing’s response to the irregularity identification issue. Finally, this article makes a number of recommendations for future study areas that the audience may find useful in their own further activities in this area."

An integrated and intelligent non partial discharge single-phase/three-phase isolation grounding safety switch is proposed. This article simulates the electric field of the main electrical components of the switch. The switch is designed with a circular arc to control the concentrated distribution of the electric field, which can reduce circuit corona.

    "abstract": "In ion thrusters, the grid electrodes are subjected to high-voltage biases for ion extraction and acceleration, but their performance is significantly impacted by vacuum breakdown. To enhance the longevity of ion thrusters and optimize the design of grid electrodes, a systematic investigation is conducted on the vacuum DC gap breakdown characteristics induced by ion sputtering. This study involved seven-aperture grid electrodes fabricated from molybdenum exposed to sputtering by $\\mathrm{Ar}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Xe}^{+}$ions at energies of 400 eV and 1000 eV for durations ranging from 0.5 to 8 hours. The results indicate that the initial breakdown voltage, which means the first breakdown voltage after sputtering, typically decreases with increasing sputtering time. However, with repeated discharges, the breakdown voltage tends to increase rapidly. The surface of the molybdenum electrode forms depressions in the sputtering area, with numerous nanoscale particles observed. These surface microstructures and particles significantly reduce the breakdown voltage, leading to insulation degradation. Additionally, sputtering with $\\mathrm{Xe}^{+}$ions induces greater fluctuations in breakdown voltage during repeated discharges, likely due to its higher sputtering yield. Measurements of dark current and calculations of the field enhancement factor are performed to examine the relationship between the local electric field and breakdown voltage. Furthermore, micro particles are identified as key contributors to the initial breakdown events. Based on these findings, two distinct discharge mechanisms are proposed: one involving cascade discharges induced by micro particles and the other driven by field emission effects."

However, compared with the AC system, the DC system current does not have natural zero crossing, and when the short-circuit fault occurs, the fault current rises rapidly, which puts forward higher requirements for the speed and reliability of the DC circuit breaker(DCCB). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel DC circuit breaker based on coupling inductance, which has the ability to limit the rise rate of fault current. This paper introduces the research status of DC circuit breakers at first, and then introduces the working principle and mathematical model analysis of the proposed circuit breaker. Next, the performance of the circuit breaker is analyzed in detail through the simulation, and the feasibility of circuit breaker is verified."

They are either not designed specifically for geospatial service monitoring, lacking comprehensive quality assessment capabilities, or, in the case of specialized tools, they do not address the full scope of monitoring challenges and are not user-friendly. These solutions do not check data quality, such as whether returned images match expected results, maintain sufficient resolution, or contain all necessary data. Natural changes in road networks, land use, and hydrography create variations between reference and newly retrieved images, making it necessary to evaluate whether these differences reflect real-world updates or inconsistencies in the service output. This paper presents GeoSense, a conceptual framework that combines simple service check algorithms with machine learning to verify both service availability and data integrity. The method detects service failures, analyzes returned images, and distinguishes between expected environmental changes and data inconsistencies. By integrating automated checks with intelligent analysis, GeoSense enhances reliability, reduces manual validation efforts, and improves the overall assessment of geospatial services."

Our solution outperforms the baseline AASIST by $10 \\%$ and improves inference speed by $40 \\%$.

In this study, a 3D transient model will be established to simulate the interaction between arc and anode. The process of electrode melting under arc heating and electrode evaporation affecting the arc is considered. In this study, a axial magnetic field contact made of pure copper with a diameter of 41 mm was used. The opening distance is 10 mm and the current is 17.5 kA (rms). The simulation results show that the electrode melts and generates an outside flow. The anode temperature is near the melting point of the metal. Meanwhile, due to the high plasma pressure, the anode did not change to an active mode. The phenomena observed in simulation and experiment are consistent."

Vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs), owing to their environmental friendliness and compact design, are widely used in medium and low voltage applications. However, their insulation performance limits their development in high-voltage applications. As the core component, the insulation strength of the vacuum interrupter (VI) directly determines the equipment’s performance. This study focuses on a 126 kV VI, establishing a two-dimensional axisymmetric model based on finite element simulation platform to analyze the influence of tank structure (diameter and length), contact fillet radius and contact gap on electric field distribution. Through parameter optimization, the selected design combines a 640 mm diameter and 2650 mm length for the tank, along with 21 mm contact rounding and 46 mm gap spacing, achieving a maximum field strength of $21.50 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{mm}$ within the vacuum interrupter while maintaining the surface field strength at the ceramic interface at $5.98 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{mm}$."

Through machine learning and deep learning, it reshapes operational logic and enhances decision-making intelligence, thus promoting sustainable development. This study empirically examines the impact of AI on green technology innovations by Chinese companies listed on the A-share market between 2014 and 2023. It finds that AI significantly enhances green innovation. This is achieved via two mediating effects: increased R&amp;D investment and enhanced total factor productivity. External factors also play a moderating role: high financing constraints mitigate the positive impact of AI on green innovation, whereas a stronger competitive market position amplifies it. Interestingly, non-capital-intensive firms demonstrate more pronounced AI-driven green innovation than their capital-intensive counterparts. These findings enrich our theoretical understanding of the role of AI in sustainable innovation and provide practical insights into how firms can use AI to promote green technological advances, particularly under different financial and market conditions."

    "abstract": "In the process of vacuum arc breaking, the axial magnetic field generated by the axial magnetic contact promotes the arc diffusion, and the initial arcing condition has an important influence on the successful breaking. However, with the increase of the current level and the increase of the opening distance, the arc starting position mostly appears in the edge area of the contact piece, which has an adverse effect on the arc breaking. In this paper, a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model is used to focus on the arcing of the high-current vacuum arc (HCVA) boundary arcing, and the different diffusion conditions in the arcing process are simulated. Two characteristic events are selected, one is the diffusion process of the arcing position of the unilateral edge, and the other is the diffusion process of the arcing position of the bilateral edge. The variation of physical parameters such as ion temperature, density and axial current density with the arcing process was studied, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results. The simulation results are helpful to understand the arc development process and physical mechanism of offset arcing under large opening distance."

To get those performances, they need to perform different steps of industrial process including current conditioning, voltage conditioning and high vacuum tests. We will present in this paper the latest finding about current conditioning manufacturing process of Axial Magnetic Field and Radial Magnetic Field contacts. It was found that the contact conditioning area is strongly affected by parameters among which, the current amplitude, current wave shape and to some extend the electrical circuit. Current conditioning of specific area of the contact was also investigated with modification of the experimental setup. The metal vapor deposition on ceramic were different after different conditioning process. The dielectric performances, i.e., basic impulse level, are strongly correlated. Therefore, it’s possible to select the optimum current conditioning process to make the voltage conditioning easier and improve the dielectric performances of VI."

    "abstract": "A substantial amount of visual data is created while conducting molecular research experiments using magnetic tweezers. Since optical tweezers dominate molecular research, few algorithms exist specifically for magnetic tweezers. Existing algorithms, when available, often have significant limitations. Many require purchases of expensive, specialized equipment, making them inaccessible for smaller and less funded laboratories. Additionally, some of these tools are not readily available, requiring them to be shared by those with access. This study was motivated by the lack of accessible and practical solutions.This study aims to develop an algorithm capable of processing low-quality, noisy images, effectively removing noise while preserving essential features such as diffraction rings. The algorithm seeks to reliably detect and track the changes of these rings throughout the experiment, which result from molecular length changes of the molecule connected to the magnetic tweezers. To enhance the performance of diffraction ring detection, we utilized Optuna search for hyperparameter optimization. The results from Optuna optimization were compared to those obtained from manual optimization. By providing a fast, accessible, and efficient method for image analysis, this solution would simplify the experimental process for researchers, making it possible for a broader range of laboratories to conduct molecular studies using magnetic tweezers. To detect these subtle changes accurately, it is essential to identify the optimal hyperparameters that enable the algorithm to perform effectively, which is the focus of this study."

So far, the most effort in implementing such a technology has been done using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) due to their logic reconfigurability and cost efficiency. The main component of a wave-union time-to-digital converter (TDC) is a tapped delay line (TDL) which consists of logic elements that act as fixed delays. Due to high dependency of FPGA on such factors as process-voltage-temperature (PVT) changes, clock-network jitter and device-to-device discrepancies, the behavior of delays of the logic elements over a course of measurements offer some degree of nonlinearity.This work focuses on the time delays quantization stability and effects of nonlinear delay distribution for a wave-union core developed for a Microchip’s IGLOO2, a general-purpose field-programmable gate array (FPGA). It is demonstrated that while controlling core voltage supply and external factors such as electro-static discharge (ESD) and temperature to be at a constant low level, the nonlinearity was still present in the processed data in the form of large random spikes, but the instability of estimated bin delays has decreased."

Objective: To investigate the current status of death coping ability among undergraduate nursing students and analyze its influencing factors. Methods: The convenience survey method was adopted. And the investigation was conducted using the Sense of Meaning in Life Scale, the Simplified Version of the Death Coping Ability Scale, and the Chinese version of the Death Attitude Description Scale. Based on these data samples, descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression were applied to analysis influencing factors of death coping ability. Results: The death coping ability score of undergraduate nursing students was 45.70±13.27, indicating a moderate level. Meaning in life, natural acceptance, death fear, and death escape were identified as influencing factors of the death coping ability level among undergraduate nursing students (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The death coping ability of undergraduate nursing students is generally at a moderate level. Meaning in life and natural acceptance are significantly positively correlated with death coping ability, while death fear is significantly negatively correlated with it. The lack of death education and insufficient practical experience are important factors restricting the improvement of death coping ability among undergraduate nursing students. It is recommended to strengthen the systematic and practical nature of death education courses in nursing education and focus on cultivating nursing students' sense of meaning in life and psychological resilience."

Such models are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Ensemble models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and LightGBM. The analysis of the experiment shows that the Random Forest model performs better compared to other models in terms of three or more evaluation measures, and accuracy is 77.273%. Moreover, the SHAP method was used to clarify the component of the best model to find out interpretability, and the main variables to affect a diabetes diagnosis include glucose level, BMI, and age. The suggested technique helps to enhance the performance of early diabetes detection and offers interpretable decision-making assistance to the clinicians."

    "abstract": "Laboratory safety in higher education institutions (HEIs) is an important issue in research and teaching, especially in high-risk environments such as chemical and biological.With the increasing demand for laboratory safety management, traditional manual checking methods face inefficiency and poor real-time performance. Therefore, introducing an automated intelligent detection system has become important to improve laboratory safety management. In this paper, a lightweight laboratory personal protective equipment detection system (LabPPE-DS) based on cross-stage partial darknet (CSPDarknet) is proposed for real-time detection of personal protective equipment (PPE) in laboratories. The system achieves high-precision PPE detection through cross-scale feature-focused fusion. It adopts pruning and knowledge distillation technology to significantly improve the system’s computational efficiency and resource adaptation capability. Through experimental validation, LabPPE-DS outperforms existing mainstream detection models in several detection metrics, effectively balancing precision and inference speed. In addition, the system is successfully deployed on computing devices without graphics processing unit (GPU) support, verifying its effectiveness in resource-constrained environments. In addition to enhancing laboratory security management, the system has a wide range of potential applications."

    "abstract": "Resource management is one of the challenges in satellite networks due to their high mobility, wide coverage, long propagation distances, and stringent constraints on energy, communication, and computation resources. Traditional resource allocation approaches rely only on hard and rigid system performance metrics. Meanwhile, incentive mechanisms, which are based on game theory and auction theory, investigate systems from the \"economic\" perspective in addition to the \"system\" perspective. Particularly, incentive mechanisms are able to take into account rationality and other behavior of human users into account, which guarantees benefits/utility of all system entities, thereby improving the scalability, adaptability, and fairness in resource allocation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of incentive mechanism design for resource management in satellite networks. The paper covers key issues in the satellite networks, such as communication resource allocation, computation offloading, privacy and security, and coordination. We conclude with future research directions including learning-based mechanism design for satellite networks."

    "abstract": "Hand-related impairments from stroke and neuromuscular diseases are rising globally, increasing the demand for prosthetic hands using surface electromyography (sEMG) for hand movement and grasp activities. sEMG systems also support human-robot interaction (HRI), aiding assistive robots in manipulator tasks. However, sEMG sensors often struggle to capture comprehensive muscle activity and are vulnerable to external hazards. In such scenarios, classical dimensionality reduction techniques often underperform, particularly when the intrinsic spatial structure of the data is overlooked. Addressing this limitation, local manifold-inspired learning techniques, such as locality preserving projection (LPP), are investigated in this study. In particular, orthogonal LPP (OLPP) helps extracting features from high-dimensional data by leveraging the orthogonal properties of nonlinear mappings from input to feature space. Nevertheless, traditional projection kernels are typically constructed based on Euclidean similarity between data points, making them highly sensitive to noise and outliers. To overcome this challenge, we have incorporated two additional similarity measures derived from the complex Euler space and Grassmannian manifold, which effectively explore the local structure in Riemannian spaces. A novel uncertainty-aware Bayesian model averaging (UaBMA) approach is proposed for integrating similarity weights from various manifolds, thereby enhancing the projection discriminability. Extensive experimental studies on both laboratory-acquired and benchmark NinaPro datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed technique over existing methods."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have traditionally been developed and trained to perform specific tasks, which limits their generalizability across different domains. Recently, the field has experienced a paradigm shift toward foundation models, wherein AI systems are pre-trained on extensive datasets to support a broad range of tasks across multiple domains. This shift is particularly promising for ultrasound imaging, a relatively low-cost and versatile modality in clinical practice. However, their adoption remains limited due to challenges such as scarce labeled data, domain-specific variability, and the need for user expertise. This review first outlines the workflow and design principles of deep learning based ultrasound clinical applications, with emphasis on advancements in supervised and self-supervised learning, discriminative models, generative AI models, foundation models, and other miscellaneous models. Recent literature on ultrasound image analysis is then reviewed in detail. Furthermore, deep learning-based ultrasound clinical applications are summarized, and the potential of foundation models to enhance diagnostic performance and expand the scope of ultrasound in clinical settings is highlighted. Finally, key challenges are discussed, and future directions for deep learning in clinical ultrasound are proposed."

    "abstract": "This work presents the design, RF evaluation, and demonstration of a communication link using a Smart Electromagnetic Skin (SES) operating in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band within a realistic indoor environment. Two metasurface-based antennas are developed: one emulating a base station (BS) with high-gain directive beams, and a second metasurface acting as an SES to generate coverage and mitigate a static blind spot. The SES is designed considering that the blind spot lies in the near-field region and, to ensure a cost-effective solution, employs a unit cell topology based on a single dielectric layer with patch-type metallizations. Although this topology does not provide a full 360∘ phase cycle, it remains cost-efficient. This limitation is explicitly incorporated into the synthesis process, enabling near-field beam shaping while accounting for practical implementation constraints and the actual field distribution generated by the BS on the SES, without relying on a plane-wave approximation. Both antennas were designed, fabricated, and experimentally validated. The BS antenna was characterized in an anechoic chamber, while the SES was evaluated in a realistic indoor scenario. The measured radiation patterns confirm the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis method and the capability of the SES as a cost-efficient solution for mitigating static near-field blind spots. Furthermore, a near-field end-to-end communication link is implemented using the designed antennas, a complete RF chain, and modulated signals generated with software-defined radio (SDR) devices. This link is validated through error vector magnitude (EVM) and symbol error rate (SER) measurements within the SES coverage. The results validate not only the electromagnetic performance of the SES but also the feasibility of near-field (not short-range) mmWave communications in realistic conditions."

This study proposes Hybrid Tabular Network with Clinical meta-features and Quality-Control Mechanisms (HybridTabNet-QC), a hybrid deep learning framework designed to enhance clinical decision support systems. By combining a transformer-based tabular encoder with medically engineered meta-features, the model delivers interpretable, generalizable, and noise-robust predictions for heart disease risk. Unlike conventional deep learning models that treat features as raw inputs, HybridTabNet-QC fuses attention-based learning with domain-specific indicators, such as body mass index (BMI), pulse pressure, and cholesterol-glucose interaction scores that ensure predictions are both statistically sound and clinically grounded. The model was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, the Heart Disease dataset and the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle. On the combined dataset, HybridTabNet-QC achieved 90.1% accuracy, 90.0% F1-score, and 93.6% AUC-ROC, outperforming traditional machine learning and standard deep learning baselines. The framework demonstrated strong robustness under feature noise and consistent generalization on external validation subsets. Interpretability analyses using LIME and SHAP confirmed that the model prioritizes clinically relevant features, supporting its suitability for real-world clinical decision support systems. These findings demonstrate the model's suitability for deployment in real-world healthcare environments where interpretability, robustness, and scalability are critical."

It systematically analyzes classical and state-of-the-art topologies, including the half-wave rectifier, voltage multiplier, Dickson charge pump, and cross-coupled rectifier, with an emphasis on their operation at voltages below 150 mV. Analytical models are derived for each topology, and validations are performed against experimental results obtained with commercial Schottky diodes, showing strong agreement within the sub-1 V range. The measurements demonstrate power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels higher than 60% for a 0.5 V input amplitude and above 30% for inputs below 200 mV, consistent with theoretical predictions. The discussion also summarizes the trade-offs between input amplitude, device characteristics, load conditions, and circuit implementations, providing quantitative guidance for design optimization. These findings establish a direct link between modeling and practical performance, providing a reliable reference for designing high-efficiency rectifiers that operate at extremely low voltages."

    "abstract": "With a broad range of emerging applications in 6G networks, wireless traffic prediction has become a critical component of network management. However, the dynamically shifting distribution of wireless traffic in non-stationary 6G networks presents significant challenges to achieving accurate and stable predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI)-enabled 6G networks, this paper proposes a novel self-refined Large Language Model (LLM) for wireless traffic prediction, namely TrafficLLM, through in-context learning without parameter fine-tuning or model training. The proposed TrafficLLM harnesses the powerful few-shot learning abilities of LLMs to enhance the scalability of traffic prediction in dynamically changing wireless environments. Specifically, our proposed TrafficLLM embraces an LLM to iteratively refine its predictions through a three-step process: traffic prediction, feedback generation, and prediction refinement. Initially, the proposed TrafficLLM conducts traffic predictions using task-specific demonstration prompts. Recognizing that LLMs may generate incorrect predictions on the first attempt, this paper designs feedback demonstration prompts to provide multifaceted and valuable feedback related to these initial predictions. The validation scheme is further incorporated to systematically enhance the accuracy of mathematical calculations during the feedback generation process. Following this comprehensive feedback, our proposed TrafficLLM introduces refinement demonstration prompts, enabling the same LLM to further refine its predictions and thereby enhance prediction performance. Evaluations on two realistic datasets demonstrate that the proposed TrafficLLM outperforms LLM-based in-context learning methods, achieving performance improvements of 23.17% and 17.09%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Cross-layer connections can couple different layers of neural networks in diverse paths, improving the classification accuracy of remote sensing images. However, some structures are unnecessary for inference and not conducive to be deployed on starboard/airborne platforms. Roughly removing them lengthens the backpropagation path and causes the gradient vanishing problem, degrading the performance of existing end-to-end training based lightweighting methods. To address this issue, we propose a decoupling-based cross-layer connection removal framework, which decomposes the complete deep network into multiple shallower stages based on the density of connections. By optimizing each stage independently, the backpropagation path is shortened and the gradient vanishing problem is expected to be alleviated. Moreover, to approximate the original network in each stage, we perform concret reconstruction error suppression on branches, layers and channels respectively. Combining these strategies, redundant structures are removed while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate that this compact architecture achieves substantially improved deployability and inference efficiency at the cost of only marginal accuracy degradation."

To address the challenge, this article proposes a data-prediction-based equivalent-input-disturbance (DPEID) method. First, the impact of short delays is modeled as a delay-induced disturbance and treated as part of a lumped disturbance. Second, a DPEID estimator is developed that utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network-based predictor to improve the disturbance-suppression capability in the presence of packet losses. Meanwhile, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network is integrated into the observer to approximate the system uncertainty, thereby improving the estimation accuracy of system states and the disturbance. Furthermore, a dual-structure control strategy is constructed based on a DPEID estimator and a networked predictive controller. This design enables the system to achieve satisfactory control performance despite the communication constraints. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified by experimental results."

    "abstract": "In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, Transformer and CNN are widely used because they complement each other in extracting features. Nevertheless, existing Transformer-based methods still struggle to capture fine-grained local spatial details and positional relationships. Meanwhile, CNN-based attention mechanisms typically process all spectral bands simultaneously to obtain global features, often overlooking locally salient information. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative normalized grouping fused comprehensive relative position transformer network (NG-CRPTN). Specifically, NG-CRPTN comprises two core modules: the comprehensive relative position module (CRPM) and the normalized mutual information band division (NMIBD). The former employs tokens of different dimensions as its foundation, modeling local-to-global spatial structures and relative positional relationships through the local independent relative position transformer (LIRPT) and global independent relative position transformer (GIRPT), while incorporating a local complementary enhancement fusion module (LCEFM) to deeply integrate high and low-frequency information from spatial features across different dimensions. The latter achieves adaptive band grouping of HSI spectral bands to better focus on locally salient features in the spectral dimension. Extensive experiments conducted on four HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed NG-CRPTN achieves superior classification accuracy with relatively few training samples compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Secondary electron emission (SEE) refers to the electron emission phenomenon from the surface of solid material while being bombarded by particles with certain energy. Charge trap (CT) is defined as the local energy state that captures electron or hole in a solid dielectric, due to defects, impurities, chemical bond breaks, and atomic reconstructions, etc. SEE and CT are two key coupling physical parameters, which are ubiquitous in electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, pulse power, electro-vacuum, high-energy physics and other fields. It is hence critical to elucidate the internal correlation mechanism between these two parameters, explore the characteristics of surface SEE under electron bombardment, and reveal the physical relationship among SEE, CT state and charge transport on material surface, so as to provide theoretical support and technical approaches for promoting the development of major projects and basic studies of different fields. A novel model of SEE considering CT (SEE-CT) is proposed to explain the physical relationship between CT and SEE. It is found that the increase of trap density decreases the secondary electron yield (SEY). When the surface of the dielectric is charged and the CT state is filled, and CT’s ability to capture electrons is lost, so that the SEY increases with the increase of the trapped electron amount. Meanwhile, a new instrument of Secondary Electron emission and Trap state in-situ Combined (SETiC) measurement for dielectric materials is constructed. It can realize the joint measurement of SEE and CT characteristics under a wide range of incident electron energy ($20 \\mathrm{eV} \\sim 50 \\mathrm{keV}$), and sample temperature ($-120 \\sim 200{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$) with a vacuum degree of $10^{-7} \\mathrm{~Pa}$. So far, SEE and CT characteristics of more than $\\mathbf{2 0}$ materials and more than $\\mathbf{1 0 0}$ samples have been tested. Several kinds of corresponding dielectric charging and discharging (DCD) suppression approaches are proposed, which considerably increase the surface discharge threshold. This work can guide the dielectric material design and optimization for improving the surface insulation performance."

    "abstract": "Vacuum has excellent electrical insulation properties, and high vacuum is a decisive factor in the normal operation of the vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs). When the pressure in vacuum interrupter is higher than $10^{-1} \\mathrm{~Pa}$, the dielectric strength will be significantly reduced and seriously affect the current breaking. For vacuum interrupter, monitoring the vacuum state continuously is of great importance to the stability of the VCBs and the safe operation of the power system. In this paper, the vacuum state detection scheme based on the Pirani method is investigated. A small iron sheet is welded to the outside of the shield, which can be heated by applying a high-frequency magnetic field. The pressure inside the interrupter is determined by detecting the variation of the resistance of the iron piece when it cools down, which depends on the pressure in the interrupter. The influence of the thickness of the target piece and the size of the welding point was analyzed with COMSOL Multiphysics. According to the simulation results, the lowest pressure that can be distinguished by this method is expected to be lower than $10^{-2} \\mathrm{~Pa}$."

    "abstract": "Vacuum interrupters are a safe and reliable part of electrical power systems. Those devices are designed for a broad operation frequency range from $50 / 60 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ [1] in conventional networks down to $16.7 / 25 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ in rail electrical power systems [2]. Expanding green energy applications such as wind turbines, pumped storage, DC and AC converters in solar parks and shipboard applications bring new requirements to vacuum interrupters as they can generate temporary fault conditions with very low frequencies. Depending on phasing, the long arcing times and high transferred charge may occur, making current interruption at the current zero (CZ) difficult. In the present work the interruption performance limit to frequencies between 2 and $\\mathbf{4 H z}$ based on the test performed at 16.7 and 50 Hz was calculated. The contact erosion rates were also grouped into two different categories as a function of current. The interruption operations are examined at frequencies between 2 and $\\mathbf{4 H z}$ and rms currents in the range $1000 \\ldots 2000 \\mathrm{~A}$ in a test-set up to observe the behaviour of the vacuum arc dynamics and to calculate the heat build-up of the contacts. The test setup was equipped with three different contact types: Butt, TMF and AMF with a diameter of between 70 and 90 mm. Finally, the arc dynamics have been analysed by means of high-speed camera technique."

    "abstract": "This study systematically assesses the impact of U.S.–China bilateral relations on the Chinese stock market. It does this by quantifying changes in these relations and analysing their potential transmission mechanisms. The aim is to provide policymakers and investors with valuable insights. First, event data related to U.S.-China bilateral relations from 2018 to 2023 were collected using GDELT text data mining technology. Based on these data, an effective U.S.-China bilateral relations index was constructed and used as a core independent variable in subsequent empirical analyses. Next, the constructed index and several other indices were used as independent variables and the Shanghai Composite Index was used as the dependent variable. Empirical analysis was then conducted using the TVP-VAR model. The results of the empirical analysis are as follows: the Chinese stock market is indeed influenced by U.S.-China bilateral relations, economic growth, market capitalisation growth, market sentiment and global stock market performance, all of which have a significant positive effect. Regarding U.S.–China bilateral relations, their impact on China's stock market is significant and manifests in diverse forms under different event contexts. Specifically, the impact of U.S.-China bilateral relations on China's stock market can be summarised as follows:1. The response sequence pattern; 2. Enhanced sensitivity during special periods; 3. Sustained risk identification under adversarial contexts; 4. Long-term confidence under cooperative contexts. To further enrich the analysis, theoretical discussions on transmission mechanisms were conducted. The results suggest that the China-U.S. bilateral relations index affects China's stock market via eight channels: corporate intrinsic value, market sentiment, macroeconomic performance, the RMB exchange rate, import and export trade, foreign investment, the level of technological development, and supply chain stability. Based on these findings, several policy and investment recommendations are proposed. The policy recommendations will help policymakers maintain financial market stability, while the investment recommendations will help investors safeguard their personal assets."

The increasing use of analog and FPGA-based chaos oscillators for secure communication applications such as security improvement and information carriers lead to the idea of utilizing both oscillators in designing a chaos-based data transmission system. The hybrid analog-discrete implementation of chaos allows for more complex modulation schemes for wireless sensor networks. The core of such an approach is the possibility of synchronizing analog chaos with its discrete counterpart implemented on the FPGA. As data transmission is done in the wireless channel, the noise immunity of such synchronization is crucial to investigate, which is the focus of this work."

    "abstract": "In existing DC circuit breakers, the vacuum interrupter (VI) is inherited directly from AC designs, and its high-speed zero-crossing interruption capability is limited. Improving this capability is crucial for increasing the counter current oscillation frequency of DC breakers and reducing overall machine cost. To evaluate the high-speed zero-crossing interruption performance of typical commercial VIs, a swastika-type transverse-magnetic-field (TMF) based VI and a quadrupolar axial-magnetic-field (AMF) based VI were selected as test specimens. A dedicated high-speed zero-crossing test platform was constructed, capable of offering current up to 15 kA at 20 Hz, and generating rate of change of current (di/dt) at current zero crossing (CZC) of $200-500 \\mathrm{~A} / \\mu \\mathrm{s}$. These findings offer valuable information for the design of a VI specifically optimized for DC breaking applications."

The present methods for surface withstand voltage enhancement in vacuum mainly focus on insulating materials. So it is difficult to comprehensively explain the effect mechanism of flashover characteristics by material modification. The integrated modification for surface parameters of electrode-insulation system was carried out based on the initiation and developing process of vacuum surface flashover. The insulating film was sprayed on the electrode surface by surface coating. The electric field strength distortion of cathode triple junction was improved, and the electron emission from the cathode was restrained, which enhanced vacuum surface flashover voltage of the electrode-insulation system. The surface parameter regulation by plasma deposition and electron beam irradiation was also introduced in brief. The vacuum surface flashover experiment of polymeric materials was developed in different voltage forms, and the material modification of both electrode and insulation can improve the surface flashover voltages."

The surface flashover simulation was conducted, and the electron density distribution is obtained, which shows that the surface flashover development process of vacuum interrupter with main shield on insulator surface is accelerated.

The arc morphology under various combinations of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields was simulated at a fixed current of 20 kA. The results show that the transverse magnetic field causes a significant deflection of the arc column between the electrodes, leading to a nonuniform distribution of plasma pressure and energy flux density on the anode surface. The longitudinal magnetic field induces arc rotation and suppresses deflection, maintaining the arc in a diffuse state. An appropriate combination of transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields achieves both rotational motion and stability of the arc column, resulting in a more uniform energy distribution. The study reveals the dominant role of magnetic field parameters in determining the spatial distribution of the vacuum arc and provides a numerical basis for understanding its deflection mechanism."

    "abstract": "The growing use of synthetic speech highlights the need to understand its differences from natural speech. Synthetic speech provides potential advantages in data augmentation, including privacy, security, and ethical data sourcing. However, the naturalness of synthetic speech is both a limitation and a risk, with deepfakes facilitating misinformation and fraud. These challenges underscore the need for improved methods to evaluate synthetic speech quality and deepfake detection. This research investigates whether latent representations from self-supervised models can identify and quantify differences between natural and synthetic speech regarding phoneme type, stress, manner, and roundedness. Our objective is to determine if models learn all phoneme categories equally or if certain groups present greater challenges, revealing limitations in synthetic speech. We pre-trained two wav2vec 2.0 models using matched natural and synthetic speech datasets. We mapped the learned codeword dictionaries to labeled test data with phoneme-level annotations and analysed the distribution and diversity of these latent representations across different phonemic categories. Our findings indicate a general lack of phonetic diversity in synthetic speech, with stress and manner showing the largest disparities. Vowels and diphthongs consistently exhibit reduced diversity. Identifying and quantifying differences in latent representations can be applied to enable enhanced synthetic speech generation, improve classification accuracy, and help to develop robust quality measurement metrics for synthetic speech."

In order to get a better understanding of the vacuum arc, the influence of contact eccentricity on the vacuum arc characteristics was studied with drawn vacuum arc experiment. The experimental results indicated the arc voltage in the eccentric case is significantly higher than that in the noneccentric case. The cathode spot tends to constrict and the constrict time is longer. Moreover, the cathode spots in the eccentricity case rarely spread to the place where the cathode and anode contacts are not in contact. The number of cathode spots moving to the side of contact is also higher with contacts eccentricity."

    "abstract": "Multiple heterogeneous agents are popular for executing pickup and delivery tasks for multiple pairs of customers. The scheduling solutions of agents are expected to complete each task within time windows, even under disturbances. Existing problem models tend to evaluate solutions through multiple simulations based on disturbances. This is time-consuming and implicit. In contrast, this article defines a robustness optimization objective based on the relationship between the agent’s arrival time and the time windows for explicit evaluation. Taking robustness together with makespan and cost, the problem is modeled as a triobjective optimization problem. To solve the problem, this article proposes matrix-learning particle swarm optimization (MLPSO) to obtain diversified and high-quality solutions for decision-makers. In MLPSO, solutions are represented as an adjacency matrix of task sequences and an allocation matrix of agents to tasks. Corresponding to the matrix-based representation, solutions are constructed by planning the task order for execution and assigning agents to tasks. A matrix-distance-based learning (MDL) strategy is developed to select neighbors in the decision space for particle update. In this way, good task segments and allocation pairs can be extracted from learning exemplars and current positions to provide stable updating directions for generating high-quality solutions. To further enhance solution convergence and diversity, a dual-space local search (DSLS) is performed on elite and sparse nondominated solutions. Experimental results on 36 instances with various scales show that the proposed MLPSO is significantly better than state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and diversity."

    "abstract": "The restoration efficiency can be significantly improved through the coordination of transmission and distribution systems. However, this process is hindered by challenges related to information aggregation, model complexity, and the uncertainty introduced by the penetration of renewable generation (RG). For this purpose, this paper proposes a novel distributed load restoration model for integrated transmission and distribution systems (ITDS) using the robust model projection method (RMPM). To achieve the distributed approach, the non convex restoration model for active distribution systems (ADSs) is first reformulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem using a sequential SOCP algorithm (SSA). The resulting high-dimensional SOCP model for ADSs is then projected into a low-dimensional space via a vertex-searching method (VSM). Next, the uncertainty of distributed RG in ADSs is considered, and the robust feasible region for the ADS restoration model is determined using the column and constraint generation (CCG) algorithm. This robust, convex feasible region is then integrated into the transmission system (TS) restoration model, which is formulated as a two-stage, three-level robust model considering the RG uncertainty. By adopting this restoration scheme, optimal coordination between ADSs and TSs is achieved with limited information exchange, thereby alleviating the communication burden. Moreover, the model's solvability can be ensured due to its low-dimensional, convex structure. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as its superiority over existing approaches, is validated through numerical experiments."

An important novelty of the proposed approaches is to build a computational model of a human-distributed robot-lumped parameter system (HDRLPS) that describes the inherent dynamical principle of human brain activity (with spatiotemporal-varying characteristic) undergoing the interaction between the intrinsic cognitive dynamics and extrinsic robot stimuli. A deterministic learning (DL)-based spatiotemporal dynamics identification scheme is proposed to accurately identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of HDRLS and obtain the associated knowledge as a constant radial basis functional neural network (RBF NN) model. A spatiotemporal dynamics estimator is designed with this model, which can accurately evaluate and monitor the dynamical process of human brain activity in real-time HRCI by the generated dynamics-synchronized state. The effectiveness and practicability of the approaches in the dynamics identification and evaluation for the human brain activity in HRCI are validated by the thorough analysis, including the mathematical proof, the simulation study, and the brain–computer interface (BCI) experiment using publicly available datasets.

    "abstract": "Spectrum cartography (SC) based on tensor completion has been extensively studied in recent years, with most algorithms operating in two-dimensional (2D) regions and based on balanced spectrum tensors only. To meet the growing demand for three-dimensional (3D) SC, expanding the 2D tensor completion algorithms to 3D versions is either straightforwardly applicable with an intrinsic accuracy deficiency or technically challenging to process the 3D-structured spatial data meticulously. Additionally, these algorithms suffer significant performance degradation when encountering unbalanced spectrum tensors. To address these issues, we propose multi-band 3D SC algorithms based on unbalanced spectrum tensors sporadically collected in 3D space across multiple bands. The unbalanced spectrum tensors are first transformed into balanced tensors using the 3D-based ket augmentation algorithm (3DKA), overcoming the unbalanced tensor’s incapability to leverage its low rank for estimating the entire tensor. Subsequently, tensor train matricization is employed to obtain more balanced matrices and improve tensor completion accuracy. Finally, tensor completion is accomplished using either the 3DKA-aided parallel matrix factorization (3DKA-PMF) or the Frobenius norm-based singular value decomposition-free (3DKA-SVDF) algorithm. Simulations show that the 3DKA-PMF algorithm achieves a minimum improvement of 20.06% over the conventional PMF algorithm. Notably, the 3DKA-SVDF algorithm exhibits slightly inferior performance but significantly shorter runtime—at most 58.3% of that of the 3DKA-PMF algorithm."

    "abstract": "Loitering vessel behavior—characterized by prolonged, irregular, or circling maneuvers within a confined area—often indicates illicit maritime activities such as illegal fishing, covert rendezvous, or surveillance operations. Detecting such behaviors remains challenging due to the discrete, noisy, and intermittent nature of Automatic Identification System (AIS) transmissions, as well as the scarcity of labeled training data. This paper proposes a Transformer-based framework that unifies AIS trajectory reconstruction and loitering behavior detection at the segment level. The proposed approach addresses two critical limitations of prior studies: (1) the inability of lightweight filtering models to recover meaningful motion continuity under long AIS gaps, and (2) the dependence on manually engineered features (e.g., spectral entropy, heading variance) and static classifiers (e.g., Random Forest) that lack temporal context. Our proposed model, based on a cross-attention–enhanced Transformer architecture, learns vessel motion dynamics directly from raw, fragmented AIS sequences, enabling both long-gap interpolation and automatic identification of loitering segments without handcrafted heuristics. Each detected loitering segment is further classified into six interpretable categories based on learned spatiotemporal attention patterns. By leveraging self-attention and self-supervised learning, the model robustly recognizes loitering even from discrete or partially missing AIS sequences. Experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy in loitering classification and maintains stable detection performance under severe AIS sparsity."

    "abstract": "We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine infant behavior in the “mobile paradigm”. This paradigm has been used in developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object hanging above an infant’s crib) is connected to one of the infant’s limbs, prompting the infant to preferentially move that “connected” limb. This ability to detect a “sensorimotor contingency” is considered to be a oundational cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically inspired motor control. We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the mobile is disconnected, shedding light on a similar occasional finding in infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction, exploration, motor noise, and biologically inspired motor control was essential for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these components are also involved in infant sensorimotor learning.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

    "abstract": "Phase modulated continuous wave (PMCW) radar sensors have received recent attention for their design flexibility and high antenna scalability needed in imaging radars for automotive driving applications. A challenge in digital radars is the detection of weak, distant targets in the presence of self-interference and any strong targets in the proximity, which places a high dynamic range requirement. Conventional matched filters used for range processing in digital radars provide limited dynamic range. To address this problem, we present a mismatched filter (MMF) framework that employs parallel MMFs, each optimized for a distinct low correlation zone. Fusion approaches to combine the resulting range-Doppler maps (RDMs) are proposed to reduce computational complexity. Under typical automotive driving target scenarios, we show that the proposed MMF design outperforms matched filter designs in achieving high dynamic range conditions under self-interference and nearby strong targets. The designed soft fusion approach is also shown to provide better performance in comparison to hard fusion of the RDMs."

    "abstract": "As 6G and beyond technologies are stepping into the spotlight, phased arrays are becoming increasingly promising candidates for agile antenna systems. In particular, aperiodic phased arrays provide many desirable traits for such technologies, such as reduced mutual coupling, sidelobe suppression, and grating lobe elimination. However, the design of such systems creates a complex, high-dimensional optimization space due to the competing traits. Traditional optimization methods often fail to scale well when applied to such high-dimensional problems. To this end, three promising algorithms that claim to perform well for such complex and large problems have been identified: Trust region Bayesian optimization (TuRBO), hybrid remora crayfish optimization algorithm (HRCOA), and the zeroth-order optimization toolbox (ZOOpt) featuring a sequential randomized coordinate shrinking classification algorithm (RACOS). The study allows maximal freedom in optimization through using free-floating elements and suggested minimum spacing through weights in the cost function. Two cases of 256 and 625 element arrays, 512 and 1250 variables, respectively, are studied using these three algorithms and compared against the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES). The convergence characteristics of each algorithm are analyzed, and their robustness for application in high-dimensional antenna array optimization problems is examined."

    "abstract": "Speech bandwidth extension (BWE) is a technique designed for generating more broadband and higher quality of speech from its bandwidth-limited version, further increasing speech naturalness and intelligibility. This paper proposes a novel two-stage architecture named SFNet for real-time BWE tasks in a neural source-filter fashion, in which the first stage extends both periodic and aperiodic excitation signals, and the second stage estimates the spectral envelope. Specifically, we introduce a sinusoidal synthesizer and a neural excitation generator to restore the excitation signal, followed by a lightweight neural magnitude filter for post-processing. By decoupling the generation process from the source-filter perspective, SFNet exhibits good interpretability and effectively reduces trainable parameters while achieving promising results. To further improve the perceptual quality of reconstructed high-frequency components, the proposed network is trained in an adversarial way. The experimental results demonstrate that incorporating prior knowledge of acoustics such as the speech production model facilitates the generation of high-quality speech and SFNet yields competitive performance for application scenarios with a target sampling rate of 48 kHz when inputting speech signals with different band limits. Besides, we derive a lite version of SFNet, namely SFNet-lite, for on-edge deployment."

    "abstract": "We investigate a scenario where multiple sources independently and voluntarily contribute status reports, which are then aggregated through a federated process. To address the challenge of partial participation in distributed systems, we introduce the age of federated information (AoFI), a novel metric that quantifies data freshness. This metric is specifically designed to bridge the gap between classical age of information, which is unsuitable for collaborative tasks, and the often impractical age of correlated information, which requires full participation. To model distributed optimization across multiple independent sources, we adopt a game-theoretic framework. In this framework, users strategically minimize their individual penalty, computed as a global-local combination of the overall AoFI on the common receiver’s side and their individual energy expenditure. We derive the worst-case Nash equilibrium of this game and compare its efficiency with the centralized optimization optimum. Our efficiency analysis reveals a critical design tradeoff for practical industrial internet of things (IIoT) deployments: while decentralized coordination is highly efficient in high-participation regimes, performance in low-participation regimes is paradoxically optimized by actively restricting the number of sources to prevent strategic inefficiencies."

The tailored optimization function balances amplitude, spectral trend, and physical regularization, ensuring stable convergence within a physically feasible solution space. The method achieves convergence within 20 iterations, yielding normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) below 0.05 and correlation coefficients above 0.98 across broadband 1–12 GHz. Robustness in additive Gaussian noise and different structures is confirmed, which illustrates the strong generalization for complex EM designs."

    "abstract": "The power generation and loads of photovoltaic (PV) systems are inherently intermittent, periodic, and stochastic, resulting in non-stationary dynamic fluctuations in line currents. These dynamics have overlapping spectral features with DC series arcs, which increases the likelihood of false alarms and reduces the accuracy of arc detection. To address this problem, a DC series arc diagnosis method based on asymmetrical Gini impurity is proposed to reduce false alarm rate while ensuring accuracy. First, arc fault current data under various operating conditions are collected through experiments. To mitigate the impact of periodic fluctuations and enhance the detection of transient current changes, a multi-step differential processing method is employed. Second, the time-domain and frequency-domain features of arc faults are extracted from the differential signal to construct a high-dimensional feature vector. To reduce redundant features, the clustering algorithm is applied to identify and group features demonstrating analogous classification performance, and the asymmetric Gini impurity (AGI) is introduced to analyze feature significance. Finally, a random forest model based on AGI is utilized for DC series arc diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves high diagnosis accuracy and effectively reduces the false alarm rate, but also completes fault detection within 60 ms."

The primary objective of this study is to examine the impact of integrating traditional quantitative signals (predictions from OLS and XGBoost) into LLM. Initial experimental results show that LLM significantly improves the fund selection efficiency of ETFs compared to traditional quantitative models. However, when OLS and XGBoost predictions are provided as supplementary information to the LLM, its performance deteriorates and in some cases it fails to produce even valid outputs. In view of this, the present paper explores further how the integration of external information affects the prediction process of LLM. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of external information on the performance of LLM. The experiments involved the use of different external information, the adjustment of prompts and the application of different LLMs.The results demonstrate that additional information has a significant effect on the output of the LLM. In most cases, the predictive performance of LLM is significantly diminished. It is evident that providing more detailed information or advanced models does not result in a substantial improvement in the outcomes. Final conclusions: Despite LLM's strong capabilities in financial asset selection, further improvements to its predictive performance are a complex challenge. It is clear that information aggregation, prompts and the use of more advanced models alone will not suffice."

This study investigates the performance of several state-of-the-art monocular depth detectors in scenarios specifically focused on eyeglass segmentation. Accurate eyeglass segmentation from monocular images is a challenging but valuable task, given its implications for face recognition, virtual try-on systems, and visual effects rendering. This paper benchmarks three prominent monocular depth detectors: UniDepthV2, Depth Anything V1, and Depth Anything V2 to assess their ability to reconstruct depth maps conducive to effective segmentation of eyeglasses. The synthetic image data set was used for performance evaluation. Segmentation effectiveness was quantitatively evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, providing clear insight into the accuracy and reliability of each depth detector’s output. The results indicated performance variations among the models evaluated, and Depth Anything V2 demonstrated superior capability in generating accurate depth maps suitable for eyeglass segmentation, evidenced by its consistently higher IoU scores. These findings contribute valuable benchmarks that can guide the future development of monocular depth detectors, emphasizing the importance of precision in depth reconstruction tasks that involve detailed object segmentation, such as eyeglasses. Further research is suggested to explore the applicability of these detectors in real-world imaging conditions and their integration into practical segmentation pipelines."

The system gathers information from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data is obtained directly from students through surveys, tracking their demographic characteristics, learning preferences, and academic performance. These data points are used to build individualized learning profiles and identify deviations from expected progress [2]. The system also records user interactions, such as task completion rates, number of attempts, and error types, allowing for detailed behavioral analysis. Secondary data, including findings from authoritative research on adaptive learning, were used to refine the system’s decision-making algorithms.Machine learning techniques play a crucial role in data processing. We utilized the k-means clustering algorithm to categorize students [3] based on similar learning behaviors, such as average scores and time spent on tasks. This segmentation helps tailor instructional strategies to specific student groups [4], [5], thereby increasing engagement and effectiveness. The clustering approach was implemented using Python’s scikit-learn library, and the results were visualized to facilitate interpretation.The system was developed using modern web technologies: Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for database management, and React.js for an interactive user interface. Data analysis was conducted in Jupyter Notebook using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.The practical significance of this research lies in its potential application in educational institutions to enhance teaching quality. By automating data analysis and generating personalized recommendations, the system reduces the burden on educators while improving student support. Additionally, the system can be expanded to analyze collaborative learning interactions and predict long-term academic performance.Future work will focus on integrating natural language processing (NLP) and neural network models to further refine personalization and feedback mechanisms.This study contributes to the advancement of adaptive learning technologies [6] by demonstrating a scalable and efficient approach to personalized education."

This paper proposed breakdown mechanism classification based on class weight optimization of imbalanced breakdown samples. Three models with different network layers were built on PyTorch. Three different class weights were set on imbalanced breakdown samples in each model. The weight optimization performance was analyzed and compared. The results showed that in each model, when the class weight of the minority breakdown samples increased, the accuracy increase in all breakdown samples fluctuated around $1 \\%(1.54 \\%, 1.85 \\%$, $0.61 \\%$) and the accuracy increase in the minority breakdown samples ranging from $6.13 \\%$ to $16.33 \\%(12.25 \\%, 16.33 \\%$, $\\mathbf{6. 1 3 \\%)}$.

Understanding the impact of inrush current erosion on the contact surface condition is crucial for improving the performance of VCBs in capacitor bank switching and for studying the dispersion of prestrike behavior. At the same time, the prestrike characteristics of VI after inrush current erosion were obtained. This study investigates the contact surface condition during the closing process based on a method for measuring the contact surface condition under DC voltage. The contact surface condition is characterized by the field enhancement factor $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. The relationship between $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ and the prestrike gap was established.

    "abstract": "In high-voltage vacuum interrupters (VIs), surface flashover on the alumina ceramic envelope can occur at a certain applied voltage, the value of which is significantly lower than that of the breakdown voltage of the ceramic envelope itself. This phenomenon severely limits the overall performance of the associated VI. Typically, a layer of insulative glaze is applied to the ceramic envelope surface, which primarily serves to enhance the contamination resistance and thermal runaway tolerance of the ceramic envelope. However, due to its high resistivity, the dissipation of accumulated charges on the surface is restrained, thus limiting the surface flashover voltage. In this work, semiconductive glaze is proposed instead of the conventional insulative counterpart, in anticipation of charge dissipation facilitation and consequently improvement of the surface flashover voltage. The effects of glaze resistivity and environment (air and vacuum) on the surface flashover voltage were systematically investigated. Results show that for the glazed ceramic with sheet resistance of $120 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega /$ sq, the flashover voltage attains the peak value, with $48.4 \\%$ increase in air and $66.5 \\%$ increase in vacuum compared to the pristine alumina, in terms of the plate samples. The corona discharge of the alumina coated with various semiconductive glaze was investigated. With the resistivity increasing, the corona onset voltage first increases and then decreases, arriving at the highest value for the glazed ceramic with sheet resistance of $120 \\mathrm{M} \\Omega /$ sq, which implies that the enhancement of surface flashover voltage with semiconductive glaze should be related to the charge dissipation facilitation. This work opens a new way to improve the surface flashover performance of the high-voltage vacuum interrupters."

    "abstract": "The understanding of the plasma-electrode interaction in arc discharges is still one of the most important research topics across many industries and applications. Cathode spots appearing on electrodes of vacuum interrupters are responsible for the current and energy transfer between the arc and the cathode but also cause erosion of the electrode material. Unipolar arcs triggered in fusion devices are a source of impurities in the plasma and may lead to instabilities during operation of the device. The state-of-the-art description of the interaction of high-pressure arcs with their electrodes usually assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the whole calculation domain; however, deviations of the LTE occurring in the near-electrode regions are relevant for an accurate understanding of the mechanisms of arc welding and related applications. Numerical simulation has become a very important tool for the development and testing of complex theorical models describing the physics of the plasma-electrode interaction. A detailed model for the simulation of the plasma-cathode interaction is presented and its application to different conditions of arc discharges is discussed."

This model integrates arc magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with the thermal and fluid pressure-driven erosion dynamics of the molten pool using a level-set method. Possible physical mechanisms, including phase change and recoil pressure are considered simultaneously in the model.

While traditional data augmentation methods have long been employed to alleviate this issue, recent advances in speech synthesis technologies have shown promising potential for further boosting ASR performance. However, a key research gap remains regarding the impact of different textual sources used for speech synthesis and how synthetic and real speech should be optimally combined during ASR training. This study addresses this gap by systematically investigating (1) what mixing strategy between real and synthetic speech yields the best recognition results for low-resource languages and (2) how synthetic speech generated from different text sources affects downstream ASR performance. Our results show that a 1:1 ratio of real to synthetic speech achieves strong performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets, suggesting it as an optimal training configuration for balancing data quality and quantity. Furthermore, our results also show that text translated from a high-resource language can indeed improve the ASR performance for low-resource languages to some extent. However, using native spoken utterances as the text source for TTS leads to consistently better performance in downstream ASR tasks."

The discharge phenomenon of high-voltage components caused by charging and discharging has become a bottleneck problem restricting the development and safe use of satellites. As an important energy component of spacecraft, space solar arrays are vulnerable to strong external electromagnetic pulse in future confrontation. When exposed to strong electromagnetic field, the space solar arrays are easily induced to produce discharge damage. To investigate the discharge damage effects induced by strong electromagnetic field coupling in space solar arrays, a three-dimensional electromagnetic model was developed based on the structural dimensions of a typical solar array configuration. By simulating the electric field coupling characteristics and patterns at the triple junction region under different excitation source parameters, we identified the most vulnerable areas prone to discharge and damage on the array surface. The resulting localized strong coupling electric fields provide essential data for subsequent analysis of discharge mechanisms in solar arrays. The research findings provide a valuable reference for the electromagnetic protection design of space solar arrays."

Simulations, using the experimentally observed initial distribution of cathode spots during the early stages of the diffusion phase as the initial condition, were performed to investigate the initial diffusion process of cathode spots triggered in vacuum arcs. The simulated cathode spot distribution and diffusion velocity show good agreement with the experimental results. The simulation results unveil the impact of plasma cloud density on the location of new spot formation."

Despite the fact that recent text-to-3D avatar generation methods have shown promising results, their joint representation and optimization of geometry and appearance often yield coarse results and limits practical applications. Our method introduces novel constraints for decoupled geometry and appearance. First, we constrain geometric optimization using a template avatar, which evolves periodically to enable flexible shape generation while maintaining decent human shape. The detailed geometry features in faces and hands are also preserved from static human priors. Second, we leverage diffusion models to guide a physically based rendering pipeline for texture generation, incorporating a lightness constraint on albedo textures to suppress incorrect lighting effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both global and local geometry quality as well as appearance fidelity. The high-quality meshes and textures produced by our approach are directly compatible with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling immediate practical applications.

The proposed approach extends the 1-D even-mirror Fourier model characterized by triangular basis functions, to the 2-D complex domain through Kronecker product operations. By applying product-to-sum trigonometric identities, the nonlinear multiplicative interactions among triangular functions are reformulated into the triangular encoding process with linear phase combinations of the IQ components, which can enable the basis function generation using adders and lookup tables (LUTs). To further prune the model, the basis functions in the static and memory-cross models are first optimized, followed by sparse selection of memory and memory-cross parameters owing to the compressibility of the triangular encoding scheme. Radio frequency (RF) measurements verify that the proposed method achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) improvements of 1.79 and 1.52 dB compared with the three-input (TI) model, for a 3.8 GHz Doherty PA at a 160 MHz bandwidth [with a running complexity of 1070 floating-point operations (FLOPs)] and a 4.7 GHz Class-A PA at a 100 MHz bandwidth (with 466 FLOPs), respectively."

    "abstract": "Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) has become a popular paradigm for executing spatiotemporal tasks, such as urban sensing, ride-hailing, and last-mile delivery. In many of these service applications, it is common for workers to undertake multiple tasks simultaneously, as this allows them to efficiently complete tasks with a convenient route. In multi-task SC, location privacy, movement cost, and service quality constitute the three most critical factors. However, the inherent contradictions among these factors pose significant challenges in simultaneously ensuring them all, and to date, no existing work has addressed all three factors concurrently. To fill the research gap, in this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving, Cost-Aware, and Quality-Enabled Service Planning (PCQ-SP) scheme for multi-task SC. First, we introduce a secure distance acquisition method with additive homomorphic encryption and garbled circuits, which enables the calculation of distances between workers and tasks while preserving both their location privacy. Second, we design a Thompson Sampling-based quality evaluation method to assess each worker's service quality by balancing exploration and exploitation. Third, we propose a minimum-cost flow-driven service planning method to derive the optimized service plans, which aims for high quality and low cost while preserving location privacy. To our knowledge, our PCQ-SP scheme is the first to simultaneously consider location privacy, movement cost, and service quality in SC systems. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our PCQ-SP scheme in enhancing service quality, reducing movement costs, and ensuring location privacy."

Leveraging self-attention scores from a pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model, the framework prioritizes semantically important tokens in both initial transmission and retransmission stages, without task-specific supervision. Experiments on sentences from public web sources confirm consistent improvements over conventional baselines in semantic fidelity, measured by cosine similarity and BERTScore. This model-agnostic approach provides a practical solution for robust and bandwidth-efficient communication, supporting future AI-native systems that prioritize meaning preservation over exact symbol reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Effective quantization can reduce implementation redundancy in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by achieving reduced bit-width while preserving system performance. However, the unified quantification (UQ) and current hybrid-precision quantization methods fail to achieve optimal bit-width reduction due to quantization coarseness or deficiencies in global search capabilities. To address these issues, this letter proposes a meta-heuristic-driven automatic quantization method for MIMO detection, named multi-population discrete grey wolf optimizer (MD-GWO). The proposed method introduces three key techniques: 1) a cosine-annealed convergence factor adaptation scheme, 2) a constrained fitness function that balances bit-width and performance loss, and 3) a multi-population cooperative optimization framework. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of MD-GWO when applied in the minimum mean square error (MMSE) and channel hardening-exploiting message passing (CHEMP) detectors under 16-QAM modulation. The method achieves an average fractional bit-width reduction of up to 61.63% and 32.31% in comparison to UQ and the state-of-the-art, respectively, without sacrificing system bit error rate (BER) performance."

The temperature dependence of static and dynamic characteristics of devices are investigated. The output power of 7.13 mW saturating at high thermal rollover current of 12.5 mA at 29 °C and only 2.7 GHz 3-dB optical bandwidth drop over the temperature range from 29 to 85 °C is observed for the VCSEL with a ~ 4.6 μm oxide-aperture diameter. The thermal resistance of the VCSELs and the internal device temperature are analysed by using the measured optical spectra. The results clearly indicate that the high temperature stability of our devices can be attributed to both improved thermal conductivity benefited from via-hole device structure and optimized quantum well gain-to-etalon wavelength offset."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Cognitive load estimation from electroencephalography (EEG) is pivotal to safety-critical domains where mental state monitoring is essential, such as healthcare, education, aviation, and human–computer interaction, yet prevailing deep models remain (i) task-specific and brittle across datasets, (ii) weakly aligned to language semantics, and (iii) sensitive to inter-/intra-subject variability and noise. Existing EEG foundation models also lack a pathway to instruction-tuned multi-task reasoning because semantically aligned EEG–text pairs are scarce. There is no unified framework that (a) discretises EEG into language-compatible tokens, (b) aligns their latent distributions with text without paired supervision, and (c) supports instruction-driven generalisation across heterogeneous EEG tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a unified EEG–language (NeuroCognitor) framework that (1) performs modality-aware vector-quantised tokenisation of time–frequency EEG segments, (2) enforces distributional cross-modal alignment via adversarial learning with gradient reversal, and (3) pretrains a multi-stream autoregressive prior with a stair-stepping causal mask before instruction-tuned multi-task adaptation on a causal LLM. On three diverse datasets, NeuroCognitor attains competitive performance and strong cross-task generalisability: on TUAB abnormality detection, NeuroCognitor-L achieves balanced accuracy 0.83 and AUROC 0.92; on TUEV event classification, it reaches Cohen’s κ = 0.71 and weighted F1 0.88. Ablations confirm the benefits of codebook size (∼8,192 entries), distributional alignment over fragment-level pairing, tokenization granularity, and strict temporal causal masking. Casting EEG as discrete tokens in a shared vocabulary with text enables a single instruction-following model to support abnormality screening, event detection, and sleep staging, thereby reducing per-task engineering and maintenance. Pair-free EEG–text alignment lowers annotation burden and facilitates deployment in data-sparse settings. Cross-dataset robustness and compatibility with standard 10–20/10–10 montages improve portability across sites and devices, while the tokenized interface provides auditable, integration-ready outputs for decision support and human–machine monitoring workflows."

Unlike traditional node-based event-triggered (NbEvT) methods, which synchronously update all neighbor information at triggering instants, edge-triggered designs individual conditions for each edge, enabling asynchronous updates and thereby reducing communication burden at most of the time. A novel DET-based FTCT control strategy is proposed, ensuring fixed-time convergence and Zeno-free phenomenon. Furthermore, a novel DET-based self-triggered mechanism is designed to avoid continuous monitoring and further reduce energy consumption. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

    "abstract": "Limited sample collection in complex forest stand is a serious challenge for automatic high-precision classification of multiple tree species. Few-shot learning (FSL) have significant advantages in handling small-sample problems, especially in transferring domain-invariant feature representations/meta knowledge from the source domain (SD) to the target dataset (TD). However, domain shift, significant differences in ground categories between SD and TD, is commonly present in cross domain FSL. A novel TSDCFSL framework is proposed, which decouples domain-invariant feature transfer from domain specific feature extraction in a two-stage manner to solve the small-sample and domain shift problems simultaneously. Its core contribution is to align the global and related subdomain distributions of SD and TD via local maximum mean discrepancy in the pre-training, thereby enhancing the domain-invariant feature representation, which is beneficial to extracting domain specific features using FSL supervised contrastive learning, and data augmentation in the fine-tuning to improve the discriminability of TD samples. Five hyperspectral datasets including three SDs and two TDs are adopted to conduct thorough experiments. Taking the XiongAn as SD, the training set contains 5 samples per class on each TD, the overall accuracy (OA) of the optimal model on GaoFeng-A and GaoFeng-B is 90.74% and 90.02%, which is better than the SD of Chikusei and HanChuan. As the training set increases to 20 samples per class, the OA reaches the highest 98.51% and 95.26% on GaoFeng-A and GaoFeng-B, respectively. The outstanding results indicate that our TSDCFSL has great potential in training high-precision tree species classification models."

In a recent national survey 16% of university students are depressed because of negative impact on their studies. Mentally disturbed students look extremely dull and will not be interested in their routine activities. Also, they will maintain a strategic distance from swarmed places to isolate themselves and used to continuously think something in their psyche. Students with stressed mindset commonly have the symptoms of feeling useless, self-pity, guilty, and less motivated. The main objective of this paper is to cautiously identify the upset students in the beginning stage itself in order to avoid any unpleasant consequence which might even lead to an extreme level, of committing suicide. A significant number of research papers were being published on the idea of depression detection in the beginning stage. This survey summarizes various depression detection methodologies and recognizes the best methodology that can produce better result in the future research work."

In this paper, the morphology and element distribution characteristics of cathode material migration caused by vacuum surface flashover in vacuum interrupter are studied via scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer. The results show that the end of the cathode shield ring and the cathode triple junction are both the initial positions of the surface flashover. The cathode metal material migrates to the surface of the ceramic shell locally in a state of micron-scale flat flakes, making cathode triple junction move forward."

The pulsed voltage waveform parameters would obviously affect the insulator flashover voltage. We usually consider the influence of peak voltage, voltage duration to evaluate the insulator performance, but the reversed polarity voltage due to the low-resistance load in electrical circuit was seldom considered. We carried out the experiments to research the insulator flashover voltage and surface charge accumulation characteristics under reversed polarity voltage to investigate the influence of reversed polarity pulsed voltage. The experiment results shown that the insulator performance with reversed polarity voltage was lower than that with uni-polarity voltage. The surface charge was easily accumulated under reversed polarity voltage. The flashover process and charge characteristics with reversed polarity pulsed voltage were also discussed. We speculated that the secondary electron avalanche would be still developed with reversed polarity pulsed voltage after main voltage. The electrons movement direction would be changed under reversed polarity pulsed voltage. The cathode region and anode region would be converted due to the reversed polarity voltage. The insulator surface charge would be distributed complexly. The flashover channel was formed more easily. Based on the experimental results, we suggest that the design of design of rep-rate pulsed power facility should carefully consider the influence of the reversed polarity pulsed voltage."

Axial magnetic field (AMF) is crucial for controlling vacuum arcs and enhancing arc extinguishing capabilities, but traditional AMF generation methods suffer from issues such as high energy consumption or static magnetic field instability. This paper proposes an innovative solution: integrating a permeability-tunable device (iron core wrapped with coils) into the Halbach array to modulate AMF strength dynamically. When the arc exists, energizing the coil saturates the iron core, diverting magnetic flux to the central region of the interrupter to maintain the arc in a diffuse mode. Before the current zero, cutting off the coil current weakens the field to facilitate plasma dissipation. Simulation results show that the central axial magnetic field reaches 76.2 mT when energized, effectively controlling the arc, and drops to 8 mT when de-energized, promoting dielectric recovery."

A number of previous studies have revealed family support as a buffer that attenuates the perceived self-burden level by patients, however, the psychological process by which the effect arises remains unknown. This paper aims to explore the mediating effects of the illness uncertainty between the linkage of family support and the perceived self-burden level in a sample of CHD patients. In this study, standard psychometric tools and a machine learning method via K-means cluster algorithm were applied to clusterize data according to relevant patterns. It is found that illness uncertainty plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between family support and the perceived self-burden level of patients, thereby showing that the improvement of family support level correlates with a lower level of perceived psychological burden with the CHD patients, and mainly due to the decline of patients’ perceived uncertainty level on their illness. This study thus stresses the importance of emotional and informative support application, alongside the intelligent data analytics, to improve patients-centered care, relieve their perceived psychological burden levels, and ultimately, enhance their adherence to an ongoing CHD treatment plan."

    "abstract": "Incremental learning is a crucial approach for enabling models to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information, addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem. However, remote sensing semantic segmentation poses additional challenges due to the multi-scale nature of land cover categories and the vast amount of information contained in high-resolution images. Moreover, issues such as data imbalance and background shift further complicate the incremental learning process. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Importance Balanced Replay and Restricted Knowledge Distillation (CIBR-RKD) framework for incremental semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Specifically, high-confidence samples are selected from the model's predictions in the current learning task, ensuring that the replayed data is both accurately labeled and feature-distinctive. Additionally, importance-balanced replay is designed to mitigate data imbalance by computing importance values based on the global class distribution and per-task frequency, ensuring a more balanced selection of replay samples. Furthermore, restricted knowledge distillation preserves knowledge of old classes by restricting the distillation process to replay data without accessing new class data, effectively addressing background shift and maintaining segmentation consistency across tasks. Extensive experiments on high-resolution remote sensing datasets, Vaihingen and Potsdam, demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art incremental learning approaches in remote sensing semantic segmentation."

Thus, a more accurate large-signal model for DDV-PLL is proposed, which fully considers the effects of grid voltage phase, frequency, and amplitude disturbances. Then, a domain of attraction (DA) estimation method based on the time-domain Maclaurin series expansion is proposed as a quantitative criterion for transient behavior and the DDV-PLL d-axis filtering parameter design guideline.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of high cognitive load and drowsiness on driving performance (speed, lane position, steering wheel movement) and driver physiology (cardiac activity, skin conductance) and uses these measures in classifying high cognitive load, alert, and drowsy driver states. A within subject driving simulator experiment was conducted with twenty-seven participants (14 females, mean age: 36.7). High cognitive load was induced via the n-back task (1-back, 2-back), a commonly used auditory-verbal recall task. Drowsiness was induced by monotonous driving (i.e., extended periods of low cognitive load), and was rated by trained observers. Mixed linear models were used to analyze the differences between the driver states, while machine learning models were used for multi-class classification. Compared to alert driving with no additional cognitive load, high cognitive load was associated with greater physiological arousal and speed variation and reduced speed and standard deviation of lane position (SDLP). Drowsiness was associated with lower physiological arousal and increased speed, SDLP, and standard deviation of steering wheel angle. Tree-based ensemble models (i.e., random forest, XGBoost) performed the best in classification. With simple features such as the average and SD, high cognitive load, drowsiness, and alert states were classified with up to 76% average accuracy. These measures could differentiate high cognitive load states with around 85% AUC and drowsiness with around 79% AUC within one model. These findings can help in the selection of metrics for driver monitoring systems that can differentiate driver cognitive overload and underload and inform the design of real-time intervention systems."

    "abstract": "Mobile network operators are working on tuning antenna tilts to improve Quality of Service (QoS) of cellular networks and expect it to be automated since tilt-tuning is a complex and time-consuming task. To improve QoS of users in an area, operators need to consider various factors such as cell coverage, interference with neighboring cells, and cell attributes and then allocate users to cells appropriately. Conventional methods address these tilt optimization problems by using User Equipment (UE) data such as UE location and throughput of each UE to adjust tilt for each UE and improve their QoS. However, there are cases where UE data cannot be used due to user privacy, and in these cases, these conventional methods cannot be applied to optimize tilts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to optimize tilts using only cell data such as the number of active UEs and cell throughput. Specifically, we estimate the user distribution and cell throughput from cell data, instead of using UE location and individual user throughput directly, and we formulate the tilt optimization problem as a black-box optimization problem that consists of the user distribution and the throughput model, and then we optimize it using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is a black-box optimization method. After that, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in both simulation environments and real environments and use statistical tests to show that the throughput obtained by the proposed method is comparable to that obtained by operators."

However, when the source domain contains classes absent in the target domain, existing methods suffer from negative transfer: knowledge of irrelevant source-only classes interferes with target class recognition, significantly degrading classification accuracy. We propose Machine Unlearning-based SFUDA (MUSFUDA), which addresses this problem by selectively unlearning source-only class knowledge from the pre-trained model rather than adding compensatory mechanisms. This machine unlearning approach allows the model to focus on shared classes, fundamentally eliminating negative transfer. Remote sensing images with large intra-class variations and high inter-class similarity cause over-unlearning of target classes when forgetting source-only classes, thus we design the Model-Disruption Based Dual-Teacher Unlearning Strategy (MDUS), which uses dual teachers to manage target class preservation and source-only class erasure through knowledge distillation. MDUS is lightweight and easily integrated into existing SFUDA frameworks. Experiments on remote sensing datasets demonstrate that combining MDUS with representative baselines consistently reduces negative transfer and improves classification performance, maintaining high efficiency, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach."

Consequently, guaranteeing a mean access delay constraint is a challenging problem since the system must control these interdependent variables. This work proposes an optimization framework that determines the maximum allowable input rate to satisfy the access delay constraint, where a throughput-maximizing backoff algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is developed. To solve the optimization problem, extensive analysis of S-ALOHA is conducted with access delay characterization. The results demonstrate that while the input rate is constrained through the proposed framework, the proposed EKF-based backoff algorithm successfully guarantees the access delay without the knowledge of the exact backlog size."

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to learning an agent fully relying on a data-driven paradigm. However, constrained by the limited quality of the offline dataset, its performance is often suboptimal. Therefore, it is desired to further finetune the agent via extra online interactions before deployment. Unfortunately, offline-to-online RL can be challenging due to two main challenges: constrained exploratory behavior and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">state–action distribution shift</i>. In view of this, we propose a simple unified uncertainty-guided (SUNG) framework, which naturally unifies the solution to both challenges with the tool of uncertainty. Specifically, SUNG quantifies uncertainty via a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based state–action visitation density estimator. To facilitate efficient exploration, SUNG presents a practical optimistic exploration strategy to select informative actions with both high value and high uncertainty. Moreover, SUNG develops an adaptive exploitation method by applying conservative offline RL objectives to high-uncertainty samples and standard online RL objectives to low-uncertainty samples to smoothly bridge offline and online stages. SUNG achieves state-of-the-art online finetuning performance when combined with different offline RL methods, across various environments and datasets in the D4RL benchmark.

Specifically, on the basis of the results from pretrained BFR models, InfoBFR considers information compression by using a manifold information bottleneck (MIB) and manifold information compensation (MIC) with efficient diffusion LoRA to conduct information optimization. InfoBFR effectively synthesizes high-fidelity faces with texture and structure boosting. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the high boosting performance of InfoBFR (nearly 82%) for state-of-the-art GAN-based and diffusion-based BFR methods, as it can complete BFR tasks in approximately 70 ms and has 4M trainable parameters. It is promising that InfoBFR is the first unified postprocessing restorer universally employed by diverse BFR models to overcome the limitations of neural degradation."

    "abstract": "Vacuum interrupters(VIs) have taken a dominant position in the field of medium and low voltage distribution due to their excellent breaking capacity and environmental friendliness. However, the heat dissipation problem of VIs has become one of the main issues limiting their rated current carrying capacity, hindering their development towards high voltage levels. At present, the traditional heat dissipation methods for VIs mainly involve shortening the current flow path and increasing the contact surface of the contacts during closing. However, these methods can lead to an increase in the size of the VIs or damage to the contact structure. Therefore, introducing new heat dissipation methods to improve the heat dissipation efficiency of VIs and enhance their rated current carrying capacity has significant practical significance. This study proposes a method of actuation based on electromagnetic effect to drive the flow of liquid metal to improve the heat dissipation effect of the static guide rod in a VIs. To explore the effectiveness of new heat dissipation methods, based on electromagnetic effect, this study established a simulation model of $\\mathbf{2 5 2 k V}$ VIs with coupled electromagneticfluid multi-physical fields, and conducted research on the convective heat transfer efficiency of electromagnetic actuation liquid metal heat dissipation. In addition, the channel structure was optimized to study the influence of different channel structures on the flow velocity of liquid metal, and the reliability of the simulation results was experimentally verified. The research results have verified that the electromagnetic driven heat dissipation method of liquid metal significantly improves the flow velocity of liquid metal. These results provide valuable suggestions for the design and optimization of the heat dissipation structure of VIs."

This affects arc extinction and causes breaking failure. To improve magnetic field distribution in the arc region, a new contact structure is designed. Several structural optimizations are applied. These include radial slotting of the contact plate, increased slot length, reduced helical angle of the contact cup, vertical slotting at the bottom of the cu p connected to the spiral slot, different helical angles for moving and fixed contact cups, and replacement of pure copper with copper-chromium alloy. Simulation results show that during high-frequency interruption, eddy currents form axial circulation paths inside the contact. Slotting structures cause clockwise components between the contact plate and cup. A strong residual magnetic field appears in the arc region. This field dominates the longitudinal magnetic distribution. The new structure reduces magnetic field intensity at current zero and peak current. At current zero, the field intensity drops by about $19.2 \\%$. The effect of residual magnetism is mitigated."

    "abstract": "Vacuum circuit breakers have long service life, environmental friendliness and excellent breaking performance, and have been widely used in the field of medium and high voltage, but there are not too many applications in the field of low voltage. The low-voltage DC circuit breaker based on parallel capacitor uses the vacuum circuit breaker, capacitor and lightning arrester in parallel, and uses the transfer capacitance current generated by the vacuum arc voltage applied to the parallel capacitor to realize the current transfer process, so as to complete the breaking, which has the potential advantages of high economy, short arcing time and fast breaking speed. The working principle and influencing factors of the low-voltage DC circuit breaker based on parallel capacitors are analyzed, and then the voltage characteristics of the vacuum arc in the DC circuit breaker are studied in detail, and it is found that the parallel capacitor has a certain inhibitory effect on the voltage rise rate of the vacuum arc, and the suppression effect increases with the increase of capacitance value, and the influence of the suppression effect on the transfer capacitance current of the circuit breaker is analyzed."

The saturation effect of breakdown voltage relative to contact gap is forcing the electrode design to be scaled up geometrically, resulting in new multi-physics challenges and increasing production complexity and costs. A novel approach and its implementation rules for the electric field stress (E-stress) sharing of the TVCB interrupter unit are proposed. First, the conventional TVCB electrode system is reconfigured into a back-to-back series structure of vacuum interrupter pair, each sub-gap operates in the linear part of the breakdown-gap curve, so as to realize the longitudinal sharing of E-stress. Additionally, an auxiliary gap channel is established in parallel with the main gap to share the E-stress laterally. Combined with the design of 252 kV interrupter pair, the equivalent electrical network modeling and simulation are completed, and the prototype of interrupter pair is designed and fabricated. Using the high-voltage testing equipment for factory inspection of vacuum interrupters, voltage parameter tests have been conducted on the pair prototype to verify the effect of E-stress sharing. Results from simulation and empirical research indicate that E-stress sharing is a practical strategy for increasing the working voltage of TVCB. The interrupter pairs within the same spatial dimensions can enhance series efficiency and dynamic insulation level. Additionally, the separate welding seal and assembly of the interrupter pair can also significantly reduce the manufacturing difficulty and production costs of TVCB."

    "abstract": "The first stage of breakdown is modeled using a phenomenological approach to the description of field emission. The field enhancement factor is calculated from the current and voltage measurements during the onset of breakdown, available in the literature. The calculation is based on the Murphy and Good formalism, combined with solving the heat-conduction equation in the electrode body. Based on the available experimental data, the field enhancement factor is not constant, but instead undergoes a gradual increase in time. It is shown that an arc can be ignited solely by means of the enhanced field emission and heating of the electrode due to the Nottingham effect. The sheath voltage does not play a role in the onset of breakdown, but it is a determining factor in whether the ignited arc can be sustained or not. The field emission center radius is found to be around 1 micrometer; field emission centers larger than this either require a field enhancement factor of order much higher than the values typically reported in the literature, or they cannot lead to sufficient heating, while smaller field emission centers produce a current that is too low compared to the experimentally measured currents in the course of a breakdown."

Blockchain technology, with its unique features including tamper-proof timestamps and smart contracts, provides an effective solution to these challenges.

As the business world is undergoing a rapid transformation, data from the behavior of consumers has become a critical resource for analyzing consumer preferences and analyzing the behavior of consumers. To address the problem of predicting purchase intent, we propose a supervised learning framework that combines a multi-class logistic regression with a decision tree classifier. The analysis reveals a prototypical funnel-shaped purchase process with significant discrepancies between interest signals and the actual buying decision. The drogue identifies the main predictors such as total visits, average session duration, and gender, while the decision tree identifies complex associations. The hybrid model can balance between interpretability and the ability to capture nonlinear feature dependencies. The empirical results show that the clickstream and carting behavior are good indicators of the purchase intention, and that the intensity and temporal dynamics of the behavior have a significant effect on the purchase intention. We use cross-validation and randomization to optimize the model to improve the model's stability and generalization. The proposed approach provides practical insights for enhancing personalized recommendation systems and optimizing data-driven advertising strategies in e-commerce settings."

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders are becoming increasingly widespread among university students, often associated with cognitive and emotional vulnerabilities. This research introduces an interpretable machine learning framework designed to detect students at elevated risk for sleep-related issues based on psychological factors. Data were collected from 1,089 participants through validated self-report instruments evaluating rumination, psychological resilience, and self-efficacy. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained, using five-fold cross-validation and tested on a 20% hold-out sample. Among these three classification algorithms, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance across multiple metrics, including accuracy, AUC, and F1 score. To enhance model transparency, SHAP values were employed to explain the influence of each predictor, identifying symptom rumination, interpersonal assistance, and reflective pondering as the most impactful variables. These findings underscore the predictive value of psychological traits in early identification of sleep disorder risks. The proposed model presents a feasible and scalable approach to campus mental health screening, especially in settings with limited clinical resources."

    "abstract": "Direct position determination (DPD) outperforms traditional two-step methods in accuracy. However, its practical application is hindered by two primary challenges: (1) the necessity to transmit raw data to the fusion center, which imposes significant demands on bandwidth and hardware resources, and (2) the absence of a closed-form solution for DPD, necessitating exhaustive search techniques and resulting in high computational complexity. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a subspace reconstruction-based DPD approach designed for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a mounted array. This method requires a data transmission amount equivalent to that of two-step localization, specifically angle-of-arrival (AOA) localization while achieving performance comparable to the existing DPD method based on subspace data fusion (SDF). Furthermore, we introduce a numerically convergent solution based on majorization-minimization (MM) that guarantees convergence to a stationary point, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and grid quantization errors (GQE) by eliminating the exhaustive search process. We validate the proposed method through computer simulations and real-world measurements conducted with a rotary-wing UAV, demonstrating its effectiveness and advantages."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the growth of high-dimensional data applications has posed a significant challenge to data analytics, particularly high-dimensional data classification. To solve this problem, efficient feature selection and extraction approaches are paramount to the success of classification analyses. The dimensionality problem of high-dimensional data, which comprises a large number of variables and complicated data matrices, is a big barrier in the health care research domains. We propose an Ensemble Classifier with Hybrid Feature Transformation for handling extremely complex dimensional data. This is proven to be efficient for selecting and extracting features from a very large dataset in a classification task. The proposed approach has been applied to the classification of an unbalanced dataset of gene expression RNA-Seq data in five types of cancer. In the hybrid feature transformation approach, the original datasets are transformed in two stages. The first phase selects the highest score features from the original dataset, which are then sent to the second phase of feature transformation. As part of the second phase, features are transformed into a new set of features. Finally, a dataset with six features is applied to the ensemble classifier which achieves 99.96% accuracy by averaging the probability systems of the groups of classifiers. The findings clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods for high-dimensional data classification."

Closed-form design equations are developed to guide the synthesis. A 2.0-GHz prototype is designed, fabricated, and measured for validation. Measurement results verify that the proposed coupler supports reconfigurable operation between forward coupling (FWCP) and backward coupling (BWCP) paths. In the FWCP mode, the power-dividing ratio can be tuned from –5.8 to 6.0dB, with the differential-mode (DM) return loss and isolation exceeding 17 and 16.7 dB, respectively. In the BWCP mode, a tuning range of –6.4 to 5.6 dB is achieved, while maintaining DM return loss and isolation greater than 16 and 16.6 dB, respectively, throughout the tuning process. The simulated and measured results show good agreement. Moreover, across all configurations, the coupler exhibits stable DM characteristics, high common-mode (CM) suppression, and low cross-mode conversion."

    "abstract": "Power converters with a small dc-link capacitor are designed to increase the lifetime by replacing bulky electrolytic capacitors or power factor correction circuits, presenting an attractive solution. However, when these power converters are connected to a weak grid, a resonance can occur between the line-side impedance and the dc-link capacitor. This resonance can lead to issues such as increased total harmonic distortion (THD) of the line current due to ac line harmonics. This article proposes an advanced finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) methodology with a multistep ahead prediction horizon for a three-phase diode rectifier system equipped with a small dc-link capacitor, driving a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The FCS-MPC cost functions are designed to control the currents on both the load and dc-link sides, aiming to reduce THD and suppress harmonics in the grid-side current. To adapt the system to varying operational conditions and ensure stability under variable load, torque, or speed conditions, two brain emotional learning-based intelligent controllers (BELBIC) are employed to design the weighting factors, aiming for a significant reduction in harmonics on both the grid and load sides. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experimental tests."

    "abstract": "Synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) has been widely used in distributed deep learning. However, since the local gradients need to be shared among workers at every iteration, SSGD performance is significantly influenced by network bottlenecks caused by either heterogeneous environment or bandwidth contention. To solve this problem, asynchronous parallel (ASP) strategy allows each worker to update parameters independently without synchronization, while suffering from accuracy loss and convergence inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity-based synchronization scheme called SIM, which mitigates the impact of network bottlenecks and ensures convergence efficiency. Specifically, SIM reduces the number of aggregation workers based on the gradient similarity between global and local gradients, therefore shrinking the waiting time for the stragglers. We provide a theoretical analysis of convergence efficiency and conduct large-scale testbed experiments on CIFAR-10 and SQUAD dataset. The experimental results show that SIM reduces the convergence time of four classical deep learning models by up to 40%."

    "abstract": "Accurate early diagnosis of neurological diseases (NDs) can effectively facilitate intervention and help with neural healthcare. While wearable informatics like Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) and Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) offer complementary gait insights, a key challenge is fusing these heterogeneous modalities, especially when the data are unaligned and scarce. In this study, our primary contribution lies in proposing a novel contrastive learning framework designed specifically to unify VGRF and IMU gait data for ND classification. This framework learns a shared representation space during training, enabling the final trained model to perform accurate diagnosis from data streams of either a single VGRF or a single IMU modality. We evaluated this approach on the classification of four NDs–Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke-against healthy controls using two public VGRF datasets and one real-world IMU dataset. As a key result, our model achieved 98.21% accuracy in the binary task (disease vs. healthy) and 96.99% accuracy in the multi-class classification. The high performance demonstrates the potential of our method to advance neural health diagnostics, providing a robust approach for gait-based neurological assessment using heterogeneous wearable sensors."

Additionally, for real-time human–machine tasks, the experiment-modeling-validation-application path may not be applicable since the experiment cannot be flexibly conducted to update cognitive models, leading to a failure of the online system control and management. To solve the dilemma, this article proposes the generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-driven ergonomics to augment the HFE research. By introducing GAI techniques, virtual-real hybrid experiments are combined and supplement more heterogeneous samples, enhancing the input diversity for cognitive modeling and behavioral learning. The case studies of human–machine cooperative driving and aerospace robotic arm operation indicate that the innovative paradigm can effectively and efficiently augment the human experiment data. It can elevate the generality and robustness of human models."

    "abstract": "In this work, we analyze the performance of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in visible light communication (VLC) systems using multicolor light emitting diodes (LEDs). The system splits data of users into a common stream decoded by all users and user-specific private streams, maps these streams onto the color channels of a multicolor LED and uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) at receiver side to exploit color diversity. Closed-form expressions are derived for the key performance metrics such as outage probability, coverage probability, and ergodic sum rate under the Lambertian channel model. To concurrently mitigate multi-user interference, which arises from cross-color coupling, and optimize the power division between the common and private data streams, a joint precoding and power allocation strategy is implemented. More specifically, the resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved by an equivalent convex reformulation to efficiently obtain the optimal power allocation coefficients. Numerical results demonstrate that in the low-to-moderate common rate regime, RSMA demonstrates superior performance over conventional scheme regarding coverage probability and ergodic sum rate. This improvement further enhances the reliability and spectral efficiency for VLC systems that employ practical multicolor LED configurations."

    "abstract": "Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging systems have attracted increasing research attention in recent years. Numerous efforts have been devoted to reducing X-ray radiation exposure and enhancing fluoroscopic image quality. These efforts include improving software and hardware algorithms to precisely estimate the location of the Region of Interest (ROI), thereby reducing the amount of imaging and enhancing image quality. Furthermore, kinematic modeling of portable intraoperative imaging systems enables automatic repositioning to standard imaging location without exposing the surgeon or patient to additional radiation. Most of these studies assume that the patient remains static during imaging. However, movements such as breathing and heartbeats can make simple kinematic modeling of fluoroscopic systems insufficient for precise imaging, necessitating ROI tracking. Therefore, extracting a dynamic model of these devices can be essential. This study aims to derive an accurate dynamic model of a fluoroscopic imaging system. The model was developed using the Euler-Lagrange method, and its base parameters were extracted through an innovative approach. To validate the model, a detailed implementation was carried out in SolidWorks and Simscape based on the catalogs and datasheets of a real system. Additionally, a one-third-scale prototype model was used to validate the method for extracting the dynamic model and base parameters. For the rich input, the highest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) corresponds to the tilt joint, with a value of 0.95 N.m. The average RMSE for the rich input is 0.3. Additionally, for the validation input, the highest RMSE value is 4.2 N.m."

    "abstract": "This letter presents a compact 11-state pattern reconfigurable dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) based on the magneto-electric (ME) dipole principle. The proposed antenna consists of a cylindrical DR in TM01δ mode excited by a central coaxial probe, operating as a vertically polarized electric monopole (E-monopole). Four identical multi-patch structures are innovatively proposed to realize four complementary magnetic monopoles (M-monopoles), which can be integrated on the DR symmetrically for compactness. By switching the PIN diodes loaded on the multi-patch structures, different M monopoles are triggered, incorporating with the shared E monopole to generate switchable ME-monopoles. By activating different ME-monopoles, up to 11 beam states can be steered, including an omnidirectional beam, two bidirectional beams, and eight directional broadside endfire beams with 45° steps. The fabricated antenna features a compact dimension of π×0.25λ 2 0 ×0.1λ0. The actual test results show that the antenna can fully cover the 5G industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band (5.725–5.875 GHz), and the peak gain of the antenna is 4.28 dBi. This solution meets the requirements of future wireless communication for compact beam-scanning antennas."

Under such conditions, the magnetic field characteristics induced by the contact differ significantly from those in power frequency $\\mathbf{A C}$ interruption. This paper investigates the magnetic behavior of cup-shaped axial magnetic field (AMF) contacts at high frequency and during ACZ interruption using finite element analysis. The results indicate that the distribution of magnetic field concentrates around slots on contact surfaces at high frequency. Furthermore, at the current zero point, the eddy current generates a substantial residual magnetic field. The magnetic field strength during commutation process and at current zero is much higher compared to AC case. These findings demonstrate that in DC interruption applications, the magnetic field in cup-shaped contacts undergoes significant distortion, which adversely affects the interruption performance. Therefore, optimizing the contact structure for DC interruption is necessary to improve performance."

    "abstract": "The urban heat island (UHI) effect poses critical challenges to urban sustainability, yet the driving mechanisms of the daytime and nighttime surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) remain insufficiently understood. This study employs an integrated approach combining remote sensing and GIS to produce a high-accuracy Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification in Beijing, and utilizes satellite-derived land surface temperature data to analyze the spatial distribution of SUHII across different LCZ types. The XGBoost model, combined with SHAP values, is used to quantify the contributions of nine urban morphological parameters to SUHII and to assess the spatiotemporal differences in these impacts. The results reveal substantial variations in daytime and nighttime SUHII across different LCZs. The highest daytime SUHII occurs in LCZ 8 with an average of 8.48°C, while the highest nighttime SUHII occurs in LCZ 1 and LCZ G, with averages of 3.68°C and 3.64°C, respectively. Crucially, different parameters dominate SUHII at different times: building surface fraction and average building volume are key drivers of daytime SUHII, whereas sky view factor and distance to water play dominant roles at night. Moreover, some parameters, such as average building height and its standard deviation, exhibit contrasting effects between day and night, highlighting the necessity of separate assessments for daytime and nighttime conditions. These findings emphasize the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of SUHII driving mechanisms, underscore the value of LCZ-based classification in disentangling UHI complexity, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying daytime–nighttime differences for designing targeted urban heat mitigation strategies."

    "abstract": "In dynamicWindows malware detection, deep learning models are extensively deployed to analyze API sequences. Methods based on API sequences play a crucial role in malware prevention. However, due to the continuous updates of APIs and the changes in API sequence calls leading to the constant evolution of malware variants, the detection capability of API sequence-based malware detection models significantly diminishes over time. We observe that the API sequences of malware samples before and after evolution usually have similar malicious semantics. Specifically, compared to the original samples, evolved malware samples often use the API sequences of the pre-evolution samples to achieve similar malicious behaviors. For instance, they access similar sensitive system resources and extend new malicious functions based on the original functionalities. In this paper, we propose a framework MME(Mitigating the impact of Malware Evolution), a framework that can enhance existing API sequence-based malware detectors and mitigate the adverse effects of malware evolution. To help detection models capture the similar semantics of these post-evolution API sequences, our framework represents API sequences using API knowledge graphs and system resource encodings and applies contrastive learning to enhance the model’s encoder. Results indicate that, compared to regular Text-CNN, our framework can significantly reduce the false positive rate by 13.10% and improve the F1-Score by 8.47% on five years of data, achieving the best experimental results. Additionally, evaluations show that our framework can save on the human costs required for model maintenance. We only need 1% of the budget per month to reduce the false positive rate by 11.16% and improve the F1-Score by 6.44%."

    "abstract": "Although many researchers have found that EV adoption depends heavily on charging infrastructure, few studies have investigated whether and how additional public charging stations operating under the Pay-Per-Use (PPU) mode affect EV adoption. In this mode, consumers pay for usage but do not obtain ownership of the product. To fill this gap, we develop two theoretical models in which a manufacturer sells EVs and private charging piles, while an independent operator provides public charging stations via the PPU mode. We confirm that the entry of public charging stations improves EV adoption. However, contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis reveals that, although the PPU mode reduces the optimal quantity of private charging piles, it may increase private charging piles' optimal prices and profits. Moreover, decreasing the operational costs of public charging stations benefits the manufacturer and consumers but may not always be profitable for the operator. To assess the robustness of our findings, we extend the models to two scenarios: including multiple EV manufacturers and considering consumer waiting at public charging stations. Besides confirming our main results, the extensions yield two additional findings: (i) As the number of manufacturers in the market increases, the operator's profits decrease. (ii) Consumer waiting costs, dependent on the proportion of public charging infrastructure, negatively affect the public charging and EV markets while benefiting the private charging pile market."

    "abstract": "Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a critical method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders such as Lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Client selection has been widely considered in Federated Learning (FL) to reduce communication overhead while ensuring proper convergence performance. Due to data heterogeneity in FL, a representative subset of participants should take into account both intra-and inter-client diversity. While existing works usually emphasize on one of them, this paper proposes a VDSV (client selection based on Value Density and Secondary Verification) framework, which optimizes the client selection strategy from both sides. Therein, intra-and inter-client diversity are respectively measured based on a designed client data score as well as gradient distance and direction. Afterwards, a client selection model is established based on a proposed metric, called client value density. Besides, a secondary validation method is developed to dynamically tweak the current client selection and model aggregation strategies. The general idea of the above design is based on the theoretical convergence analysis and the observation that the client contribution to the global model can get changed throughout the learning process. The experimental results demonstrate that VDSV can achieve higher convergence rates and ensure comparable model performance. In specific, our method can reduce the communication rounds by an average of 37.88%, which saves noticeable communication overhead."

However, most existing methods lack mechanisms to verify model predictions before their acceptance and suffer from labeled data scarcity. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Cooperative Learning for Automated Annotation (DCLA) framework. DCLA integrates named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) models that employ the multi-head attention mechanism and the global pointer to handle complex entities and relations. Building on this foundation, a cooperative learning (CL) mechanism is introduced to evaluate prediction quality through score matrices for sample ranking and selection. Low-quality predictions are verified by annotators, while high-quality predictions are accepted automatically, enabling iterative retraining with cooperatively labeled data. Experiments on a CP-specific corpus demonstrate that DCLA's NER and RE models outperform state-of-the-art methods, while the CL mechanism enhances proofreading efficiency. Overall, DCLA enhances proofreading efficiency, mitigates data scarcity, and supports continuous model refinement."

    "abstract": "Local planning is an essential module for Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), in order for a vehicle to safely reach its destination by adapting to rapidly changing road conditions. Although some simple heuristic approaches may satisfy the real-time requirements of the local planning module, they tend to struggle in complex and dynamic scenarios. While a variety of approaches—including reachability-based, optimization-based, sampling-based, and learning-based methods—are capable of handling more complex scenarios in simulation, their practical effectiveness remains uncertain due to long computation time or limited experimental validation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and adaptable sampling-based local trajectory planning method to handle diverse scenarios while ensuring computational efficiency and robust performance in real-world environments. The proposed method leverages the Lateral Recursive Feasible Set (LRFS) to define the control input range based on road boundary constraints, ensuring sampled trajectories within the boundary. To further enhance trajectory sampling efficiency, we introduce a truncated normal distribution for control input sampling, allowing trajectories to remain within safe regions. The effectiveness of our method, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">LRFS-MPPI</i>, is demonstrated through comparisons with existing sampling-based methods in terms of execution time, sampling efficiency, the quality of the determined trajectory in simulation, and validation through hardware experiments. The results show that LRFS-MPPI efficiently generates collision-free trajectories suitable for real-time autonomous driving."

However, note that the previously proposed scheme is based on the assumption that both the two receivers can send their received signals back to the transmitter via two feedback channels, which may not be available when a certain feedback channel fails to work. In this paper, we study the GBC-WTC with common message and partial feedback, where only one legitimate receiver can send his received signal back to the sender via a perfect feedback channel. A hybrid scheme, which combines the classical Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) feedback control scheme, a dirty paper pre-coding scheme and the conventional random binning scheme is proposed for this model. Numerical results show that even in such a partial feedback case, our proposed scheme still works well and outperforms the existing secret-key based scheme in the literature."

    "abstract": "With the increasing level of driving automation, localization and navigation are not only used to provide positioning and route guidance information for users, but are also important inputs for vehicle control. Odometry localization method is the most widely used localization method due to its good short-term accuracy and cost-effectiveness, despite its known limitations like drift and environment dependency. Optimizing odometry remains a valuable area of research. By using the UKF-based odometry localization methode for vehicles with increased maneuverability introduced in our previous work, this paper presents a simulation-based optimization method to improve the accuracy of the odometry. This proposed simulation-based optimization method aims to achieve the accuracy goal with low computation effort. The covariance matrices of the UKF-based odometry are optimized by the particle swarm algorithm. In order to make the in simulation optimized covariance also applicable in the real vehicle, sensor error models are built up to generate realistic sensor signals. To reduce the computation effort during optimization an efficient driving maneuver, which covers more vehicle states is generated and used instead of normal parking maneuvers. The use of the efficient driving maneuver has been shown to reduce the optimization effort by approximately 60% without sacrifice the optimization effect. The efficacy of the optimized covariance matrices in enhancing odometry accuracy has been validated in both simulated and real-driving tests. The optimized odometry can reach an average end position error of 11cm and average end orientation error of 0.4∘. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of sensor accuracy and noise level on odometry has been performed in the simulation environment with the help of the proposed optimization methods. Odometry using sensors of various accuarcy and noise levels are optimized to achieve its best performance. The simulation results indicate the importance of the IMU sensor in the odometry localization method. This conclusion is supported by the results of a real driving test that used two IMU sensors with different accuracy and noise levels. The results of the sensitivity analysis provides a basis for sensor selection in vehicle system design."

    "abstract": "Voiceprint verification has been widely adopted in daily applications due to its convenience and efficiency. However, the latent representations extracted during speech verification often encode sensitive personal information, such as emotion and gender, which raises significant privacy concerns. Existing methods mainly focus on protecting predefined sensitive attributes, but in many cases, the attributes that attackers are interested in are unknown to defenders. To address this limitation, we propose the Speech Information Bottleneck Network (SIBNet), a framework for representation level privacy enhancement based on information theoretic approaches. SIBNet differs from existing speech attribute privacy mechanisms in three key respects: (1) We formulate biometric privacy protection as an Information Bottleneck (IB) optimization problem that balances identity utility and sensitive attribute suppression. (2) SIBNet leverages a variational distribution parameterized by neural networks to approximate mutual information, enabling the derivation of lower bounds for effective model optimization. (3) An additive angular margin penalty is introduced into the speaker classification loss to promote discriminative embeddings and preserve identity utility. Experiments on public speech datasets demonstrate that SIBNet significantly outperforms state of the art methods in both biometric recognition accuracy and suppression of sensitive soft biometric attributes."

    "abstract": "Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) exploits subtle, device-specific imperfections in physical-layer signals—known as Radio Frequency Fingerprints (RFFs)—to distinguish authorized transmitters from unauthorized ones. Conventional deep-learning SEI approaches, however, typically require large labeled datasets, incur long training times, consume substantial computational resources, and provide limited interpretability—constraints that hinder deployment on resource-constrained receivers. We propose BLi2, a lightweight Broad Learning (BL) framework engineered to mitigate these challenges for open-set SEI in IoT settings. BLi2 uses an Instantaneous Autocorrelation Representation (IAR) to extract compact, phase-based fingerprints from raw I/Q samples and employs a two-stage open-set recognition pipeline to detect unauthorized emitters before closed-set classification. Experiments on two real-world ADS-B datasets and a Wi-Fi dataset demonstrate that BLi2: (1) attains >98.80% closed-set accuracy for 50 classes (98.72% for 150 classes while using only ≈0.195M parameters—over a half as comparable BL methods) and ≈90% open-set accuracy with 50 unknowns; (2) trains in under 20 s on a Raspberry Pi, maintaining >96.33% accuracy across SNRs; and (3) improves accuracy by >12% compared with raw I/Q baselines in the reported ablation. These results validate that BLi2 provides high identification accuracy while maintaining the computational efficiency required for edge-IoT deployments."

The experimental setup enables normalized magnetic field measurements using a calibrated Hall sensor, allowing direct comparison with simulation results. The measured values show good agreement with the simulation, with deviations remaining below $8.5 \\%$. These findings confirm the suitability of the setup and contact configuration for assessing AMF behavior and magnetic field thresholds cited in literature.

Audio splicing detection has become increasingly vital in the realms of security, digital forensics, and fact-checking, as manipulated audio can be used to spread misinformation or falsify evidence. This paper presents a novel approach to detecting audio splicing by leveraging a self-supervised front end, wav2vec2, in combination with a simple logistic regression classifier. Unlike conventional methods that require handcrafted features or complex models, our method utilizes the rich, context-aware representations produced by wav2vec2 to train a linear classifier that effectively distinguishes between authentic and spliced audio segments. We demonstrate that even with a basic classifier, the wav2vec2 representations capture sufficient discriminative information to achieve good performance on our benchmark dataset."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces NODE-MLEM, a novel method based on physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), for the tomographic reconstruction of vacuum arcs. By modeling the reconstruction process as a continuous dynamical system described by a NODE, NODE-MLEM leverages neural networks to learn the complex mapping from projection data and the current image state to image updates. The method explicitly incorporates physical constraints derived from the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) algorithm, primarily through data consistency in the loss function, significantly enhancing reconstruction accuracy and physical plausibility. Compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches, NODEMLEM integrates physical model information (system matrix and projection data) to guide the learning of physically consistent reconstruction dynamics. It can also incorporate Total Variation (TV) regularization to improve spatial smoothness and noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate NODE-MLEM’s superior performance in vacuum arc reconstruction, achieving a $25.78 \\%$ PSNR improvement and increasing SSIM from 0.780 to 0.977 over conventional CNNs, closely approaching the quality of MLEM-TV reconstructions (average SSIM 0.989) but with a $\\sim 136$-fold increase in inference speed. This highlights an excellent balance between accuracy and speed, effectively utilizing physical information to guide the learning process and offering a memory-efficient, high-performance solution for large-scale 3D reconstruction."

    "abstract": "With the increase of breaking voltage level, studying the evolution characteristics of reignition of high-current vacuum arc plays an important role to improve the breaking capacity of vacuum circuit breakers. In order to analyze the characteristics of the arc in the reignition phase of 126 kV axial magnetic field (AMF) contacts, drawn vacuum arc experiments were conducted in a detachable vacuum chamber. Two high-speed cameras were used simultaneously from two angles to capture the dynamic process of the arc column and cathode spots, respectively. By analyzing the arc images and arc voltage characteristic of high-current interruption experiments with a pair of 140 mm diameter cup-type six-slot AMF contact, the arcing reignition process in the second half-wave can be divided into stages of re-ignition stage, disordered movement stage, dispersed arc stage, transition stage, and diffused arc stage. After current zero during the second half-wave, the axial magnetic field is weak, resulting in poor control over the arc. In this process, the arc voltage presents significant noise, and cathode spots are distributed on the conductive rod, the side of the contacts, and the contact surfaces. As the current increases and the axial magnetic field strengthens, the control of the arc gradually improves. The arc transitions from dispersed mode to diffused mode after current peak. At the same time, cathode spots continuously spread on the contact surface, the arc voltage gradually becomes stable, and the arc extinguishes at the second current zero."

    "abstract": "Vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs) have gained a dominant position in medium-voltage applications due to their environmentally benign nature and excellent interruption performance. With ongoing technological advancements, their application is gradually expanding into higher voltage levels. A precise understanding of the initiation and evolution of vacuum arcs is essential for improving the operational performance and design of VCBs. The interelectrode plasma in a vacuum arc is generated by multiple cathode spots distributed over the cathode surface. Each cathode spot emits a plasma jet, which merges with adjacent jets at a certain distance from the cathode to form a continuous arc column. Therefore, investigating the interaction and mixing behavior of multiple plasma jets under high-current conditions is vital for deepening the understanding of vacuum arc dynamics. This paper develops a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model based on a practical vacuum interrupter design featuring a six-slot axial magnetic field contact structure. The model is used to simulate the mixing process of plasma jets from multiple cathode spots under highcurrent conditions. Key plasma parameters-including ion pressure, ion temperature, axial velocity, and axial current density—are computed and analyzed. Moreover, the influence of a uniform axial magnetic field on the mixing characteristics of the cathodic plasma jets is systematically investigated. The results provide theoretical support for further studies on vacuum arc behavior and offer technical insights for enhancing the interruption capability of vacuum switching devices. This work also contributes to the future optimization and development of vacuum circuit breaker technologies"

    "abstract": "During the closing process of vacuum circuit breakers at voltage levels of 40.5 kV and higher, the high mass of the moving contacts, large opening distance, and fast closing speed can lead to a continuous bouncing motion between the contacts at the moment of closure. The small rebound distance of the moving contact can cause multiple instances of arcing, making it prone to welding of the contacts. Furthermore, the bouncing motion accelerates electrical wear, which severely affects the electrical lifespan of the vacuum circuit breaker. Therefore, reducing the bouncing during closure is one of the key issues in vacuum circuit breaker research. This paper applies particle-damping technology to the insulating rod to reduce the number of bounces, bounce duration, and Bouncing amplitude of the contacts. The analysis focuses on experimental studies of the displacement curve and bounce duration during the contact closure, comparing the number of bounces, duration, and amplitude of the contacts with different filling materials. The research results indicate that the particle damping’s volume, material, particle size, and mixing ratio significantly affect the suppression of closing bounces. The addition of appropriate particle damping can effectively reduce or even eliminate the bouncing phenomenon during closure."

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that cathode spots (CSs) consist of substructures such as cells or fragments. To further understand the underlying mechanisms of CSs motion, this paper develops a two-dimensional stepwise simulation model based on cathode cells. In this model, cathode cell motion is driven by two key processes: splitting when the cell current exceeds a certain critical value, and excavating a new cell near the end of the cell lifetime. The directional probability of new cell generation is influenced by the surrounding magnetic field and electron density distribution, while the probability of successful excavation depends on the original cell’s current, the number of nearby cells, their current, and distance to the center of the original cell. Additionally, the model incorporates several microphysical mechanisms, including currentdependent variations in cells’ lifetime, the electron density evolution during cells’ life cycle (increasing during excavation and decreasing near the end of the lifetime), and cells extinction when its current falls below a certain threshold value. Simulations successfully replicate several classical phenomena, such as the random motion of CSs, retrograde motion under transverse magnetic fields (TMFs), and the effects of varying TMFs strengths and currents on CSs motion, validating the feasibility of the model. This paper provides an effective tool for advancing the study of the mechanisms of CSs motion and distribution."

The evolution of arc shape and plasma distribution law during the arc quenching process are also analyzed. The results show that: during the arc quenching stage, the high-speed zone of plasma motion transitions from the near-anode contact area to the cathode contact area as the current decreases; the temperature in the middle area of the fracture decreases sharply, and the arc is disconnected from the middle area of the arc column; the maximal value of the plasma pressure occurs in the nearcathode area, and the plasma pressure in the arc column area shrinks to the cathode with the decrease of the current; the flux distribution of the contact surface concentrates on the groove gap of the arc column area and the magnetic flux distribution in the arc column area of the contact surface is concentrated in the groove gap of the arc column area. The magnetic flux distribution on the contact surface is concentrated in the slot gap of the arc column region, and the magnetic field in the slot gap of the arc column region on the contact surface decays slower than that in the other regions on the contact surface."

    "abstract": "Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency's (ASI) COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data. Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre- and post-event imagery, our model utilizes only post-event data, facilitating rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquake in Türkiye, covering multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions, underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the paper."

This study presents a platform technology integrating full-spectrum analysis (400-700 nm) with machine learning to enhance qualitative LFIAs with semi-quantitative assessment capabilities. We analyzed 241 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens using portable spectrometry to capture gold nanoparticle optical signatures from SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests as a validation model. Systematic evaluation of normalization strategies revealed T-C differential outperformed T/C ratio normalization. Signal processing through Savitzky-Golay filtering, standard normal variate transformation, and principal component analysis reduced dimensionality from 601 to 4 features while retaining 97.26% variance. Among five evaluated algorithms, random forest achieved optimal performance (R² = 0.961, RMSE = 2.235 Ct) across clinically relevant ranges (PCR Ct 10.8-35.0). Bland-Altman analysis revealed measurement uncertainty of ±4.2 Ct, indicating suitability for population surveillance rather than precise individual quantification. Feature importance analysis identified 520-570 nm as the critical spectral region, consistent with gold nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance. This platform approach demonstrates that standard LFIAs contain extractable semi-quantitative information accessible through spectral-machine learning integration. While validated using COVID-19, the framework's modular design enables adaptation to diverse analytes including biomarkers, therapeutic drugs, and environmental contaminants without fundamental architectural changes. The methodology establishes a foundation for enhanced lateral flow diagnostics, particularly valuable in resource-limited settings where rapid semi-quantitative results provide greater utility than delayed laboratory measurements."

    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis can prevent vision loss, and automatic grading is particularly important to assist physicians in making timely decisions. This work proposes an efficient stacked ensemble framework for the DR severity classification task. Unlike traditional ensembles, our model leverages out-of-fold predictions and collaborative meta-learning to improve ordinal consistency without leaking information during training. We incorporate the best features of three top deep learning architectures: Swin-B Transformer, EfficientNetV2-L, and ConvNeXt-L. A meta-learner maximizes their collective capacity for prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely available datasets, the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset and a larger Kaggle dataset, were conducted to evaluate our approach. We investigated the generalization capability of our ensemble with both 3-fold and 5-fold cross-validation. With the highest classification accuracy of 97.9% for the APTOS dataset and 98.2% for the Kaggle dataset, the results clearly indicate that our stacked model outperforms all individual networks. Furthermore, for both datasets, we consistently achieved a high QWK value of 0.97. This reflects strong agreement between our predictions and professional clinical evaluations. It also demonstrates the goodness of our model dealing with ordinal data. These findings emphasize that there is great potential in Stacked Ensembling to enhance the accuracy and robustness of automated diabetic retinopathy grading systems, particularly when combined with diverse high performance base models."

First, a dynamic attenuation-regularized low-rank decomposition model is established, enabling adaptive parameter adjustment to separate background scattered light from target signals. Then, a nonlinear correlation equation for polarization-driven transmittance based on Beer-Lambert Law is developed, combining isotropic intensity attenuation transmittance through adaptive weighting mechanism to establish the composite transmittance, more in line with the underwater optical and physical characteristics Finally, a dual-constraint optimization architecture is designed to effectively suppress descattering noise. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better imaging results and significant improvements in key metrics.

TT can result in irreversible testicular damage or loss if not promptly diagnosed and surgically treated. Early and accurate diagnosis is therefore essential to preserve testicular viability. While medical image analysis has proved valuable in diagnostics, the automated detection of TT remains a challenge due to subtle image variations and limited datasets. In this study, we present a dataset of 323 ultrasound images collected from three hospitals across Jordan, encompassing both normal and TT cases. We evaluated five classification models, including two traditional machine learning models employing a novel DiscreteWavelet Transform (DWT)-based feature extraction method inspired by EEG signal analysis, and three transfer learning models based on pretrained deep architectures. Among the evaluated models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with DWT and ResNet50 achieved the best performance, with accuracies of 88% and 87% and F1scores of 82% for both. The results demonstrate that both the wavelet-based SVM model and the deep transfer learning model (ResNet50) achieved comparable and reliable performance for automated TT detection."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) extraction is a key technology for physical layer authentication, relying on the unique hardware imperfections of transmitters. However, its application in vehicular networks remains challenging due to the dynamic and unpredictable channel conditions that often lead to overfitting. Current methods struggle to generalize beyond the specific sequences and statistical channel characteristics present in training data, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios where unknown signal data and varying channel conditions are the norm. This research addresses this gap by developing a novel framework to enhance RFF extraction in LTE-V2X devices. Here, we propose a two-step approach to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. First, we introduce a Contextual Contrastive Learning (CCL) network that employs three loss functions with varied fusion weights to learn robust representations. This network is trained using signals from the same frame symbols, different content frames from the same device, and the same content frames from different devices, effectively reducing the model’s reliance on fixed data patterns. Second, we implement an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) network, wherein signals are collected from multiple transmitting devices at a single location while receivers are placed at several fixed positions. This setup allows the network to learn device-specific representations that are invariant to channel variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging environments characterized by multipath and shadow fading."

The four stubs can generate a loop current for enabling good omnidirectionality in the azimuth plane. Also, they can also be utilized to tune the tag resonant frequency effectively. An easy way of building the tag’s physical equivalent circuit model has been demonstrated here by decomposing the antenna structure into four equal quadrants. Since all the lumped components are derived from physical models, the circuit model can be used to describe the antenna impedance characteristics reasonably accurately. The proposed tag has a compact size of 33 mm × 33 mm × 3.084 mm (0.1007λ × 0.1007λ × 0.0094λ), and it can be effectively read from at least ~ 6.3 m (4W EIRP) in the azimuth plane when placed on metal. Good omnidirectionality can be achieved by maintaining the gain variation below 0.41 dB across the entire azimuth plane."

While the role of visual attention in visualization interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a 235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts (high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers) focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal - a novel visual saliency model that predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and Sal2Lit - a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual data communication to enhance understanding."

Knowledge sharing and model personalization are key strategies for addressing this issue. Clustered federated learning is a class of FL methods that groups clients that observe similarly distributed data into clusters, such that every client is typically associated with one data distribution and participates in training a model for that distribution along their cluster peers. In this paper, we present a unified Bayesian framework for clustered FL which associates clients to clusters. Then we propose several practical algorithms to handle the, otherwise growing, data associations in a way that trades off performance and computational complexity. This work provides insights on client-cluster associations and enables client knowledge sharing in new ways. The proposed framework circumvents the need for unique client-cluster associations, which is seen to increase the performance of the resulting models in a variety of experiments."

    "abstract": "To address the issue of spatiotemporal coupling in random charging loads caused by the large-scale integration of electric vehicles, which disrupts the dynamic stability of microgrids, a Lyapunov-based microgrid optimization scheduling method (LOSM) is proposed. The key innovation lies in its dual virtual queue system, which meticulously models the spatiotemporally coupled randomness of BSS operation without relying on any forecasting, setting it apart from traditional prediction-dependent approaches. First, an energy storage system model incorporating a dynamic energy management mechanism is established. In contrast to traditional forecasting-dependent methods, our approach introduces a virtual queue for the battery unit state of charge (SOC), which enables real-time adaptability and significantly reduces reliance on prediction accuracy. This mechanism accurately characterizes the time-varying charging and discharging processes, thereby mitigating the impact of power fluctuations caused by charging on system frequency stability. Subsequently, a spatiotemporally correlated virtual queue is constructed for the multimodal operation of the battery swapping station, further enhancing real-time tracking capability without requiring high-accuracy forecasts. This achieves multidimensional and precise tracking of its electrical energy state. By integrating these virtual queues with a penalty factor adjustment mechanism, the proposed method simultaneously optimizes operational economy and dynamic stability while satisfying system stability constraints. Simulation analysis under a typical diurnal residential load profile with a 50-EV battery swapping station and a significant penetration of wind and photovoltaic generation demonstrates that the proposed approach increases the revenue of the battery swapping station by 5.67% and reduces the start-stop frequency of the diesel generator by 37.04%. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the robust operation of microgrids in scenarios involving electric vehicle integration and serves as an important reference for establishing dynamic stability assurance mechanisms in new power systems."

A feature suppression strategy is proposed to reduce the network’s over-reliance on important features of the source domain data to improve generalization performance. In addition, we design a luminance contrast consistency (LCC) learning module to harmonize the data styles between different domains and a multiscale convolutional attention (MSCA) module to enhance the network’s perception of small target objects and improve the segmentation performance of the model, which further improves segmentation performance.

    "abstract": "Software testing is a critical activity in the software development cycle since it confirms code correctness, reliability, and maintainability. Unit testing, a cornerstone of software testing, involves verifying the correctness of individual components of a program. Manually writing these tests is a resource-intensive and time-consuming activity. Researchers have proposed various automated test generation methods to reduce the possibility of this problem. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in automatically generating unit tests in recent years. Although a single LLM configuration can produce a satisfactory response, there are possible risks to the effectiveness of the generated tests, such as the repetition of specific test cases, the lack of edge case coverage, and the omission of full assertions. We present a novel method, LLM Chaining, that uses the collaboration of several LLMs, namely Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.5 Sonnet, to collaborate and iteratively enhance tests. We started by looking into a single LLM writing unit test, but after seeing how well they performed, we looked into LLM chaining as a way to increase the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the tests that were produced. Gemini and GPT-4o yielded the most reliable results of all the configurations we tested. Under this configuration, the LLM system uses Gemini to generate the initial JUnit tests, then sends the generated results to GPT-4o for assimilation of accuracy and depth. The HumanEval dataset was used to create JUnit test cases for this study. JaCoCo was used to collect coverage statistics, and PIT (Pitest) was used for mutation-based testing to gauge an LLM’s capacity to identify test flaws. With 99.05% branch coverage, 90.48% line coverage from 3508 test runs, and 94.32% mutation coverage, we achieved genuinely impressive results. In contrast, under the same circumstances, Randoop, a well-known automated test generation tool, obtained 68.64% branch coverage and 78.84% line coverage. This demonstrates how multi-step LLM refinement works well to advance automated test generation and, in the end, produce software that is more dependable and maintainable."

This paper proposes a novel DOA estimation method based on orthogonal distributed arrays for accurate AV localization. Specifically, the covariance matrix between orthogonal arrays is exploited to construct two univariate polynomials for DOA estimation. As the polynomial degree depends on the array aperture and the discontinuous sensor layout, the resulting polynomials are often high-order and lacunary. To efficiently solve these polynomials, an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed, featuring an adaptive mutation strategy to reduce computational cost and a counter-based mechanism to escape local optima. In addition, a covariance-based cost function is designed for 2D angle pairing. The array aperture is further extended to enable simultaneous DOA estimation of multiple vehicles when the orthogonal arrays share a common sensor. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves higher estimation accuracy and lower computational complexity, offering a promising solution for vehicle positioning in IoV environments."

While traditional analytical and statistical methods laid the foundation, recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have improved prediction and compensation precision. However, critical challenges persist, including generalizability across complex geometries and adaptability to position-dependent variations in batch production. Traditional methods of controlling geometric deviations often rely on complex parameterized models and repetitive metrology, which can be time-consuming yet not applicable for batch production. In this paper, we present a novel, process-agnostic approach to address the challenge of ensuring geometric precision and accuracy in position-dependent AM production. The proposed GraphCompNet presents a novel computational framework integrating graph-based neural networks with a generative adversarial network (GAN)-inspired training paradigm. The framework leverages point cloud representations and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) to model intricate geometries while incorporating position-specific thermal and mechanical variations. A two-stage adversarial training process iteratively refines compensated designs using a compensator-predictor architecture, enabling real-time feedback and optimization. Experimental validation across various shapes and positions demonstrates the framework’s ability to predict deviations in freeform geometries and adapt to position-dependent batch production conditions, significantly improving compensation accuracy (35% to 65%) across the entire printing space, addressing position-dependent variabilities within the print chamber. The proposed method advances the development of a Digital Twin for AM, offering scalable, real-time monitoring and compensation capabilities. This work bridges critical gaps in AM process control, paving the way for high-precision, automated, and industrial-scale design and manufacturing systems."

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks serve as an efficient approach to reveal potential weaknesses of deep neural networks (DNNs). In practice, models are often deployed in black-box settings, where access to parameters and architectures is restricted. This imposes requirements on the transferability of adversarial examples crafted on the source model, which is typically enhanced by simulating diverse input patterns through input transformations during gradient computation. However, given the lack of a clear foreground-background distinction, scene classification in remote sensing images typically relies on global contextual understanding, which exhibits substantial inter-model variation. In addition, the diversity of geospatial structures further amplifies the discrepancies across different model architectures. These factors jointly impede the enhancement of adversarial transferability due to overfitting to model-specific information. To address this challenge, we propose asymmetric frequency mixing (AFM) to improve adversarial transferability for remote sensing scene classification. Specifically, context patterns are simulated by selectively employing an asymmetrical mixing operation in the frequency domain. For images of the same scene category, low-frequency components decomposed by the discrete wavelet transform are mixed to enrich semantic-related diversity. Meanwhile, high-frequency components are mixed in a class-agnostic fashion to suppress model-specific bias toward background texture information. Moreover, a block shuffling operation is imposed on the reconstructed images to reduce inter-model discrepancies in capturing geospatial structures. Extensive experiments on the UCMerced Land Use and SIRI-WHU datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across different model architectures."

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel framework for onsite estimation of lithium-ion battery electrochemical parameters by combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with transfer learning (TL). Unlike conventional physics-based models that require costly offline parameterization or extensive experimental tests, the proposed two-phase strategy first trains a PINN using only the governing equations of the single particle model, and then fine-tunes selected electrochemical parameters with field voltage measurements while keeping most network weights frozen. This enables efficient adaptation to ageing and cell-to-cell variability with minimal data requirements. The approach achieves high accuracy in estimating key parameters such as diffusion coefficients and active material volume fractions under different degradation conditions. Under a simulation environment, the method reconstructs voltage responses with a root-mean-square error of 8.94 mV and estimates active material fractions with an average relative error below 2.2% across 400 study cases, significantly outperforming classical optimization-based estimators. Experimental validation on an aged NMC cell (82.09% nominal capacity) implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5, demonstrates practical feasibility, yielding a relative error of 3.89% in estimating volume fractions with a computational cost of 106 ms per iteration. These results confirm that the proposed TL-based PINN framework offers an accurate, computationally efficient, and easily deployable solution for real-time battery management systems."

    "abstract": "This paper summarizes the main results obtained in the last 15 years at the High Voltage Padova Test Facilities dedicated to support the design and the commissioning of the ITER Neutral Beam injector.Several experiments and tests in High Voltage Direct Current were performed in high and medium vacuum on electrodes separated by gaps, from a few mm up to 150 mm, and with voltages up to 800 kVdc. Different types of surface finishing, electrodic configurations, surface treatments and coatings were tested with the aim to gain knowledge on the several aspects influencing the de voltage holding in high vacuum.Systematic tests were performed in high vacuum on stainless steel electrodes to validate a probabilistic model to predict the maximum voltage of a generic-shape, multielectrode systems isolated by high vacuum gaps. Such tests have confirmed the existence of a marked “total voltage effect” from gap lengths larger than few centimeters. Tests in Ar, H2 and N2, were carried out to characterize the “pressure effect” corresponding to the voltage holding increase observable in medium vacuum until the left side of the Paschen curve is reached. Furthermore, the effect of the application of a static magnetic field on the Townsend discharge and how the Paschen curve is consequently modified was clarified experimentally. Endurance tests have been performed by applying stationary electric fields, up to $60 \\mathrm{kV} / \\mathrm{mm}$, for several days on stainless steel electrodes. These tests made it possible to observe the irreversible switch-on phenomena with currents of tens of microA on electrodes separated by $\\mathbf{1 ~ m m}$ gaps.Experimental evidences regarding the spatial distribution of the power dissipated during micro-discharges in high vacuum, have been explained by the existence of charged particles accumulation points in case of electrodes separated by large vacuum gaps. A mutual exchange of charged particles between electrodes seems a reasonable physical mechanism to interpret the experimental observations. An intense development activity on the X-ray detectors has been carried out. A spectral and intensity measurement system of the X rays emission produced by the bremsstrahlung radiation has been developed which allows continuously monitoring the state of the electrode conditioning without interfering with the test in progress and without inserting any device in vacuum. The analysis of X-rays emitted on time scales of the order of microseconds has made it possible to identify, in a large number of the observed vacuum discharges ($\\approx \\mathbf{4 0 \\%}$), that bursts of electrons impinging the anodic surface are the breakdown precursors. The consequent Electron Stimulated Desorption of gas from the anodic surface have been considered a key player in the development of the electrical discharge and in the collapse of the voltage between the electrodes. Finally, tests have been carried out on solid insulators, optical fibers and spark gaps. A review concerning the lessons learned, the open issues and the next activities is also presented."

The modelling results are in good agreement with the experimental data for various air pressures. It is found that the deviation from the similarity law, occurring for higher pressures, is likely to be caused by the field emission from the cathode, rather than by the enhanced ionization of neutral gas molecules in regions of increased electric field near the protrusions on the anode surface."

Therefore, reducing sudden power peaks is critical for minimizing operational expenses. The proposed system employs clamp-type current transformers (CT sensors), which can be attached to existing electrical lines without modifying facility infrastructure. Sensor data is wirelessly transmitted using Long Range (LoRa), a low-power, long-range communication technology, enabling centralized management and visualization of multi-line electricity data without additional wiring. This study presents the design and implementation of a complete monitoring solution composed of microcontroller-based sensor nodes, LoRa-compatible gateways, and a server-driven visualization dashboard.

    "abstract": "Pose estimation using visual sensors has become a fundamental component in robotic navigation and autonomous driving systems. Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) has attracted substantial attention due to its resilience to camera parameter variations and dynamic environments. Given that camera movement manifests as pixel-level motion across the entire image in optical flow data, capturing both global contextual information and local feature details is crucial for accurate pose estimation. To address this challenge, we propose SwinFVO, a novel self-supervised visual odometry framework that incorporates enhanced motion perception to achieve global spatial dependency modeling with temporal continuity. Leveraging quadrant-based motion characteristics, we perform cross-regional feature interaction through a refined Swin Transformer architecture. Two robust spatiotemporal feature extractors are designed to extend the single-frame-based Swin Transformer to a temporally-aware framework for sequential understanding. Through the exploration of long-range spatial correlations and preservation of temporal consistency, SwinFVO delivers accurate and consistent pose estimation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance and generalization capability of SwinFVO in both pose and depth estimation tasks. It achieves competitive results against classical algorithms and outperforms related state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by up to 20.6% and 72.4% on average translational and rotational evaluations, respectively."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective computing has achieved significant progress due to the rapidly developing learning model. However, compared to computer vision or natural language processing-related tasks, EEG data presents challenges such as a low signal-to-noise ratio, small sample size, and nonstationary properties. These factors may affect the model’s performance on cross-domain tasks, suggesting that further improvements are necessary. Existing models aim to minimize intraclass distance and maximize interclass distance to achieve an optimal solution. This can potentially have a negative impact on the model’s generalization ability because they ignore the existence of low-quality training samples that may not be suitable for strict optimization. This article presents a method for determining sample quality based on the guidance of knowledge from emotional neuroscience. The method differentiates between high- and low-quality training samples and designs a corresponding loss function to impose intraclass and interclass constraints on hyperspherical manifolds based on the quality of the samples. Therefore, it can be argued that our proposed method achieves a better balance between reducing the intraclass distance of high-quality samples and preventing the overfitting of low-quality ones. This could potentially help build a more robust EEG emotion recognition model. Numerous experiments are conducted on the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) and SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (IV) (SEED-IV) datasets under cross-subject and cross-session scenarios, which show the superior performance of our proposed method and its higher recognition accuracy against adversarial attacks."

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of renewable energy sources necessitates efficient and scalable solutions for the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem. Existing mathematical programming and centralized machine learning approaches often suffer from high computational complexity, limited scalability, and difficulty in maintaining feasibility under complex operating conditions. To address these drawbacks, this study proposes DeepOPF-MB, a novel decentralized AC-OPF solver based on a multi-branch deep neural network (MB-DNN) architecture. To enable decentralized learning, the framework employs the Louvain community detection algorithm to partition the power network into loosely coupled subnetworks. For each subnetwork, a dedicated branch of the MB-DNN is trained to learn the mapping from bus loads to voltages at non-zero injection buses, leveraging a physics-informed unsupervised learning paradigm that incorporates domain-specific constraints. Voltages at zero-injection buses are subsequently reconstructed via Kron reduction. Comprehensive simulations on IEEE 30/118/300-bus systems demonstrate that DeepOPF-MB achieves superior performance to graph neural network-based approach, and centralized supervised and unsupervised learning approaches with comparable neural network size in optimality, feasibility, and computational complexity, and it is robust to the community detection algorithm employed for network partitioning. These results underscore the potential of DeepOPF-MB as a viable and efficient solution for real-time decentralized AC-OPF in large-scale power systems."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, but its deployment on resource-constrained devices is hindered by high communication overhead, inefficient energy usage, and poor convergence under non-IID data distributions. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE-FL: a Green Resource-Aware Communication-Efficient Federated Learning framework that explicitly incorporates device energy capacity into training. Each client adapts its learning rate, number of local epochs, and gradient quantization bit-width based on its available energy, allowing high-capacity devices to sustain more intensive training while low-capacity devices operate with lighter configurations. A novel energy-weighted aggregation strategy ensures that clients with greater energy resources contribute more significantly to the global model while maintaining fairness. Theoretically, we show that GRACE-FL achieves an unbiased gradient estimate and guarantees convergence at a rate of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O ( 1 / \\sqrt{T} )$</tex-math></inline-formula> under standard non-convex assumptions, even in the presence of quantization noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE-FL consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving 20–30& energy savings and up to 28& lower communication costs while preserving competitive or superior accuracy under both IID and non-IID settings. Finally, on-device validation with five Raspberry Pi 4B clients and fine-grained energy profiling confirms these gains in practice with SimpleCNN and ResNet-18, GRACE-FL delivers faster convergence, improved fairness, and substantial energy efficiency, paving the way for sustainable and practical FL in real-world edge deployments."

Meanwhile, currently prevalent graph neural networks often struggle to capture effective semantic structures when dealing with learning tasks involving diverse specific events, consequently exhibiting limited generalization and transfer capabilities. This study focuses on crowd gathering events in transportation scenarios and conducts quantitative analysis of their potential risks to traffic network. Relying on the massive online crowd query data produced in Location Based Services (LBS), we propose a generative strategy for node and edge augmentation based on event-traffic interactions, which seeks to generate richer supervised signals. Furthermore, in response to the generative graph structure derived from event chains that fail to match the contextual semantic information, we utilize comparative learning for self-supervised training as the auxiliary proxy task of time series prediction. Experiments on the benchmark datasets of real road networks show that the proposed method is effective in identifying the traffic risk of road segments, especially when the breakdown probability is greater than 50%."

    "abstract": "In extended reality (XR) virtual interaction environments, both flexible user interaction and reliable authentication are essential. However, current wearable systems relying on single-sensor data suffer from insufficient data dimensionality, often failing to simultaneously achieve fine-grained gesture recognition and continuous authentication. Multi-sensor systems, while more capable, tend to be bulky, comfort-compromising, and computationally demanding for edge deployment. Furthermore, inefficient parallel processing and the decoupled pipeline for gesture and authentication tasks degrade computational efficiency, ultimately hindering practical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose M-Ring, a lightweight ring-based system equipped with a compact, optimized sensor layout that synchronously captures impedance and IMU signals. By fusing complementary physiological and behavioral cues, M-Ring enables accurate hand-state perception. We design an adaptive-scale convolutional network with a parameter-separated and progressively routed architecture (PLE), which effectively captures intrinsic correlations within multimodal data and enhances synergy between gesture recognition and user authentication, all while minimizing computational overhead. For fine-grained authentication, we propose a dual-factor framework that integrates Siamese networks with contrastive learning to enhance inter-user discriminability. By jointly modeling physiological activations and kinematic patterns, our approach enables both seamless gesture-based interaction and non-intrusive continuous authentication. Experiments demonstrate that M-Ring achieves 97.8% gesture recognition accuracy and 97.5% identity authentication accuracy under complex conditions, while maintaining low enrollment cost, power efficiency, low latency, and strong edge deployment capability."

However, customer acceptance of robo advisory remains challenging, as financial services are perceived as more complex and personal than non-financial tasks typically managed by robots. This study examines the impact of trust, perceived value, and customer-robot compatibility on the acceptance of robo-services in banking. Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 550 respondents and conducted in depth interviews with six participants to capture lived experiences with robo-advisors. The findings of narrative inquiry were used to explore various factors affecting robot service acceptance. Further these insights served as meta-inferences for developing the proposed framework and quantitative study. Our findings reveal that trust- and empathy-driven interactions have a significant impact on customer perceptions, thereby enhancing service robot acceptance. We emphasise the role of robot empathy responses and active customer involvement as critical moderators in fostering trust. Practical implications suggest that humanising robo-services can reshape banking standards by increasing customer confidence and adopting AI-driven financial solutions. This study contributes to the growing literature on human-robot interaction in financial services, highlighting strategic pathways for banks to leverage AI for enhanced customer engagement."

    "abstract": "High slope microstructure array has been widely used in fields such as beam shaping, three-dimensional imaging and micro-optical systems, requiring sub-micron profile accuracy and nanoscale surface roughness. However, the small size and high slope lead to measurement interference, probe slip, and low reflected light intensity. Existing profile measurement methods for micro-aspherical-cylindrical lens array (MACLA) cannot meet processing requirements. In this paper, a generatrix deflection method (GDM) was proposed to enhance the measurement accuracy of MACLA profile. By tilting the workpiece being measured, the method reduced the contact measurement slope, effectively avoiding measurement interference and probe slip. A constant scallop-height grinding method was used for binderless tungsten carbide (BWC) to product uniform surfaces and consistent structures, achieving a surface roughness of 80 nm. The principle of GDM reducing measurement slope and error were explained by slope calculation and force analysis. Additionally, a data processing technique and a standardized evaluation framework were developed for measuring MACLA profiles with different measurement systems. A comparison between the GDM method and existing measurement methods showed significant improvements in accuracy. When the generatrix deflection angle was 50°, the deviation extreme value between measurement results and the reference profile with the GDM method was 0.881 μm, with a Gaussian fitting mean of 0.27 μm and a standard deviation of 0.186 μm. Compared to the optimal results from other measurement methods, the proposed method improved accuracy by 53%, 41%, and 55%, respectively. These results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the GDM method, providing valuable data for the precision evaluation and compensation machining of MACLA."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of the Inverter Based Resource Monitor (IBRM), an innovative behind-the-meter synchronized measurement unit (SMU) tailored for integration with inverter-based resources (IBRs). The IBRM distinguishes itself as a highly accurate and cost-effective SMU, offering facile deployment and connectivity to IBRs. It is equipped to conduct real-time voltage and current waveform analyses, serving as a phasor measurement unit (PMU) with exceptionally rapid synchrophasor transmission capabilities. The device incorporates a cutting-edge dual-core architecture designed to minimize sampling delays inherent to its microprocessor, thereby enhancing the precision of synchronized waveform measurements. Moreover, the IBRM is adept at recording high-fidelity waveform data, capturing nuances such as waveform distortions, high-order harmonics, and wide-band oscillations prevalent in power grids with substantial IBR presence. A prototype of the IBRM has been constructed and subjected to rigorous testing to assess its functional capabilities and measurement precision, utilizing both idealized signal generators and a real-world off-grid inverter setup as benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Floods are complex hydrological phenomena influenced by precipitation patterns and basin morphology. Although optical remote sensing is widely used for flood mapping, its effectiveness is often limited by cloud cover, which leads to data gaps and misclassifications. This study presents a novel method for detecting flooded areas in cloud-contaminated optical imagery by integrating hydrological and morphometric attributes derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The approach includes a customized cloud and shadow mask generated using the Rpart classifier, designed to reduce false positives while preserving surface water signals. The method employs a two-step Random Forest (RF) classification process. The first step (RF1) integrates optical imagery with DEM attributes to identify visible surface water. The second step (RF2) uses only DEM-derived features to replicate RF1 and extend flood mapping beneath cloud-covered regions. The method was validated using synthetic cloud data, achieving an Out-of-Bag Global Accuracy (GA) of 94% and a Jaccard Index of 0.94 for the RF2 replication task. In independent validation, the model showed strong performance: for randomly sampled test data, GA reached 94.06% with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 72%; for stratified sampling, GA reached 88% with an MCC of 78%. These results highlight the model's robustness across diverse conditions. The proposed cloud-aware flood detection method provides a fast and accurate tool for post-disaster mapping, supporting emergency response efforts and enhancing flood risk management by mitigating the limitations of optical-only approaches."

However, High-Resolution (HR) tomographs that can capture brain images with high spatial resolution are expensive. Therefore, Super-Resolution (SR) technique can be used to improve spatial resolution of the MRI images captured with lower resolution tomographs. State-of-the-art SR methods applied to medical images are prone to over-blurring the output images, due to focusing only on the pixel correctness aspect, but not on the perceptual quality of the generated images. We employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with advanced degradation techniques to train SR model, that produces not only sharp, but also fine details preserving images. We also empirically prove, that using SR in MCI diagnostic pipeline can improve classification performance by 1–4%."

To address this issue, this paper first analyzes the variation law of residual flux density under static voltage distribution after opening operation. Then, the breakdown process of the vacuum circuit breaker is studied, and an equivalent circuit model is constructed. The characteristics of grading capacitors in double-break vacuum circuit breakers and the influence of closing asynchronism on magnetizing inrush current are theoretically analyzed. Finally, a simulation circuit for closing an unloaded transformer with a double-break vacuum circuit breaker is established to simulate the variation law of inrush current during the closing process. The results indicate that after opening operation, residual flux density is converted into dynamic magnetic flux by grading capacitors. The average value method can be adopted in calculations to avoid extreme conditions. During the closing process, the influences of closing asynchronism and grading capacitor imbalance on magnetizing inrush current are found to be minimal."

    "abstract": "Vacuum circuit breaker adopts vacuum environment as insulation and arc extinguishing medium, which can effectively improve the safety of the power system and reduce the operation and maintenance cost, and it is a kind of ideal zero-carbon and fluorine-free environmentally friendly power switchgear. At present, with the development of the power industry and the increase of system capacity, the size of the vacuum circuit breaker is also increasing, and its breaking performance and arc-firing characteristics are affected by the size. Therefore, this paper establishes a magnetohydrodynamic model (MHD) of a large-size vacuum arc with a diameter of 140 mm, and investigates the whole process of vacuum arc ignition under different opening moments. The results show that the plasma pressure, current density, electron and ion temperatures are positively correlated with the current and negatively correlated with the ion velocity. The increase of arc current leads to the uneven radial distribution of plasma, and the parameter distribution first contracts and then expands with the arc-firing process, lagging behind the current change. The region of high ion pressure is unfavorable for acceleration, and the ion velocity is opposite to the pressure distribution. The contraction of the arc toward the anode increases the ion collisions, the conversion of kinetic and internal energies leads to an increase in the ion temperature, and the Joule heating increases the electron temperature. The results of the study can provide theoretical support for the development of vacuum circuit breakers with larger size and high opening current."

This paper addresses the issue of maximizing user rates in a beyond directional reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-assisted network with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users. However, exploiting the gains offered by these frameworks necessitates joint tuning of BD-RIS phases and NOMA power, which is an inherently non-convex problem. We model this coupling as a continuous-action Markov decision process and solve it using twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. The learned policy adaptively selects power-allocation factors and BD-RIS phase shifts, thereby boosting both communication and sensing rates under quality-of-service constraints. Simulation results confirm that the proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme significantly outperforms conventional heuristics, demonstrating its potential for real-time resource optimization in 6G networks."

CFFL effectively addresses detection failures in poisoning attacks arising from the “distance concentration” among high-dimensional data. Specifically, firstly, we establishes a local update model for clients, where the similarity between model updates is quantified through local Coulomb resultant force (LCRF), effectively distinguishing malicious and benign updates; Secondly, we develop a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based Coulomb resultant force anomaly detection (NCFAD) model that identifies malicious updates by isolating top-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i> outliers with largest neighborhood factor; Finally, experiment results validate that CFFL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in defense performance and achieves model accuracy equivalent to the baseline FedAvg on NCI-1, PROTEINS_full, and MNIST datasets (90.82%, 92.23%, and 96.49%, respectively).

    "abstract": "Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) paradigm offers an appealing solution for clients that have limited computational resources. It allows entities to train models with collected dataset and powerful cloud resources, and to deploy these models for inference. However, MLaaS currently faces significant challenges in ensuring trustworthy inference and service quality. The clients cannot verify that the inference results returned by service provider (SP) are the model’s actual inference results. Moreover, even if clients manage to ensure that the results are obtained through model inference, they are unable to determine the model’s service quality without ground truth. To address these concerns, we introduce an innovative framework to audit inference quality and integrity in MLaaS through a novel deep neural network (DNN) inspection method. In specific, our approach represents the inherent behavior of the model by collecting its intermediate layer outputs and quantifying the mutual information (MI) values derived from them. By benchmarking the model during the training process, the SP can record the characteristics of the correct model and its corresponding service quality. After receiving the auditing request, the auditor can evaluate the quality of the service by estimating its accuracy via mutual information. Moreover, it can confirm the integrity of the returned results by inspecting the intermediate layer output. In addition, we thoroughly analyze our scheme for various potential adaptive attacks. Through empirical studies, we verify the correctness, effectiveness, and robustness of our scheme for trustworthy MLaaS inference service."

    "abstract": "Large medical equipment such as MRI, CT scanners, and linear accelerators are critical healthcare infrastructure. The health status of these systems directly impacts diagnHealth-Aware Control osis accuracy, treatment efficacy, and overall healthcare quality. However, current maintenance approaches often rely on fixed schedules or reactive strategies, leading to unnecessary downtime, increased costs, and potential patient care disruptions. This lack of uncertain information hinders robust decision-making in health-aware control (HAC) and maintenance scheduling. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel probabilistic remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method for large medical equipment based on a Bayesian graph attention transformer. First, we construct a graph attention network to extract complex non-Euclidean spatial relationships between multiple sensor signals from medical equipment. We then integrate this graph attention mechanism into the transformer's temporal multi-head attention module, combining graph attention networks' spatial feature extraction advantages with transformer models' temporal feature extraction capabilities. This integration enables joint extraction of spatiotemporal relationships in sensor data. Simultaneously, we employ an improved Bayesian network to quantify prediction uncertainty, providing point estimates of RUL and corresponding confidence intervals. The resulting framework supports HAC decisions that balance large medical equipment performance and longevity. Experiments conducted on two medical equipment operation datasets (CT and MRI) demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to existing methods, achieving more accurate and reliable RUL predictions that enable optimized maintenance scheduling and enhanced HAC strategies."

    "abstract": "Tens of thousands of people have represented data by creating data-encoding textile pieces like blankets, scarves, and more. A prototypical example is the temperature blanket, which represents the weather through rows or blocks of different colors mapped to temperature ranges. While researchers have used fiber arts mediums to create exploratory projects, data visualization and physicalization research has largely not engaged with examples from this enormous and diverse community. We explore the space of data textiles, or fiber arts that encode information, by surveying creators (i.e., data fiber artists) on their projects and processes. We create a corpus of 159 examples of data textiles and present a schema characterizing the data encoding methods used in these projects. We also gather insights into creators' data workflows as well as their motives and discoveries through making with their data. Creators of data textiles use distinct processes to map their data, building fabric from component structures and substructures while using material properties like color and texture. From diverse data-tracking procedures, creators use and relate to data in varied ways. Working on these pieces also contributes to the creators' personal growth and data understanding. Our findings point to new opportunities for visualization, including opportunities to support fiber artists with tools formatted to their needs and opportunities to incorporate concepts from data textiles into other types of visualization (e.g., using texture, structural layouts, colorways)."

    "abstract": "Cell state discovery is crucial for understanding biological systems and enhancing medical outcomes. A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system CellScout–in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states."

    "abstract": "With the revolution of generative AI, video-related tasks have been widely studied. However, current state-of-the-art video models still lag behind image models in visual quality and user control over generated content. In this paper, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TokenWarping</i>, a novel framework for temporally coherent video translation. Existing diffusion-based video editing approaches rely solely on key and value patches in self-attention to ensure temporal consistency, often sacrificing the preservation of local and structural regions. Critically, these methods overlook the significance of the query patches in achieving accurate feature aggregation and temporal coherence. In contrast, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TokenWarping</i> leverages complementary token priors by constructing temporal correlations across different frames. Our method begins by extracting optical flows from source videos. During the denoising process of the diffusion model, these optical flows are used to warp the previous frame's query, key, and value patches, aligning them with the current frame's patches. By directly warping the query patches, we enhance feature aggregation in self-attention, while warping the key and value patches ensures temporal consistency across frames. This token warping imposes explicit constraints on the self-attention layer outputs, effectively ensuring temporally coherent translation. Our framework does not require any additional training or fine-tuning and can be seamlessly integrated with existing text-to-image editing methods. We conduct extensive experiments on various video translation tasks, demonstrating that <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TokenWarping</i> surpasses state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Early seizure detection is essential to minimize the harm caused by their possessions. Presently, medical professionals use optical testing of electroencephalographic (EEG) data for project labeling, which may be a labor-intensive and delayed procedure. By resolving EEG data using the best spatial convolutional interconnected system-long temporary thought (1D CNNLSTM) model, this study offers a revolutionary pattern for always identifying seizures. Before the raw EEG dossier is augmented into a 1D CNN that pulls appearance data from the dossier, it is preprocessed and standardized. Hence, worldly faces are extracted using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, which are then combined into various suitably linked coatings for capture recognition. The projected model’s representation was evaluated using the UCI epileptic capture acknowledgment dataset. For the twofold and five-class taking acknowledgment tasks, respectively, the outcomes show an exceptional acknowledgment veracity of 99.39 % and 82.00 %. The predicted model achieved better act when compared to existing machine intelligence setups and additional deep education models. These rulings highlight the promise of the proposed method for accurately diagnosing seizures in patients who are experiencing muscular spasms and acknowledge the potential for improved impartial outcomes."

    "abstract": "Combining optical remote sensing images for ship monitoring is a practical approach for maritime surveillance. However, existing research lacks sufficient detection accuracy and fails to consider computational resource constraints in ship detection processing. This paper proposes a novel lightweight rotating ship target detection model. First, we enhance the detection accuracy by expanding the YOLOv8n-obb model with Large Selective Kernel (LSK) attention mechanism, Weight-Fusion Multi-Branch Auxiliary FPN (WFMAFPN), and Dynamic Task-Aligned Detection Head (DTAH). Specifically, the LSK attention mechanism dynamically adjusts the receptive field, effectively capturing multi-scale features. The WFMAFPN improves the capacity of feature fusion by the multi-directional paths and adaptive weight assignment to individual feature maps. The DTAH further enhances detection performance by improving task interaction between classification and localization. Second, we reduce the computational resource consumption of our model. This technique is developed by pruning based on layer adaptive magnitude on the enhanced architecture and designing the DTAH module with shared parameters. Considering the above improvement, we name our model RYOLO-LWMD-Lite. Finally, we constructed a large-scale dataset for rotating ships, named AShipClass9, with diverse ship categories to evaluate our model. Experimental results indicate that the RYOLO-LWMD-Lite model achieves higher detection accuracy while maintaining a lower parameter count. Specifically, the model's parameter count is approximately 2/3 that of YOLOv8n-obb, and the test accuracy on AShipClass9 reaches 48.2% (in terms of AP<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</sub>), a 6% improvement over the baseline.

    "abstract": "The development of robotic systems for search and rescue (SAR) operations holds great potential in reducing risks to rescue workers and enhancing the likelihood of successful rescue operations. Although many studies have been conducted on search and rescue robotics, more emphasis should be placed on developing rescue robots, especially those intended for physical rescue interventions, such as loading and transporting injured individuals (i.e., casualties) to a secure area—the process known as casualty extraction. The enabling technologies for such robots remain challenging due to the complexity of the tasks, significantly high safety considerations, and strict standards—since the robots are designed to interact with casualties physically. In addition to academic institutions, most research and technical implementations of state-of-the-art casualty extraction robots are carried out by military organisations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of the art in developing mobile rescue robots for casualty extraction. The existing casualty extraction robot proposals publicly available in the literature are discussed and evaluated in terms of their design and morphology. Moreover, this review details the proposed casualty extraction procedure that corresponds to the robot designs, the operation method, and the levels of autonomy of these robots. The existing state-of-the-art technologies are discussed and compared to evaluate the pros and cons of each system, providing a guideline for further research into areas where more effort could be applied. Based on the review and evaluation of the existing state-of-the-art, we identify critical research gaps that require further investigation to enhance the current state of the art and facilitate long-term development in rescue robotics research."

With the emergence of the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication networks, supporting massive machine-type communications with sporadic activity patterns is expected to become a critical challenge. Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address this challenge by decoupling user identification from data transmission through the use of a common codebook. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of URA solutions, encompassing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. We present a systematic classification of URA solutions across three primary channel models: Gaussian multiple access channels (GMACs), single-antenna fading channels, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. For each category, we analyze and compare state-of-the-art solutions in terms of performance, complexity, and practical feasibility. Additionally, we discuss critical challenges such as interference management, computational complexity, and synchronization. The survey concludes with promising future research directions and potential methods to address existing limitations, providing a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in this rapidly evolving field."

    "abstract": "Small vehicles (SV) detection is crucial for urban security and traffic management. However, detecting such targets from a single image presents significant challenges due to the difficulty in discerning their dynamic movements. In this paper, we propose a deep joint image-level and feature-level processing network, IFNet, designed for detecting changes in SV using bi-temporal hyperspectral images. At the image-level, a new Gumbel Softmax trick (GS)-based band selection strategy is introduced to address the problem of inconsistent spectral resolutions of bi-temporal images. At the feature-level, to tackle the challenge of capturing edge and shape details of SV, we propose a feature-based edge enhancement module, it can extract the target edge using high-level difference features, and the refined change map will be generated with the guidance of the edge map. Moreover, current deep learning-based hyperspectral change detection (HCD) methods are limited by HCD datasets. Therefore, we propose a benchmark dataset, the Hyperspectral Vehicle Change Detection (HVCD) dataset, which consists of 201 pairs of aerial hyperspectral images, each with a size of 256 × 256, and exhibits inconsistent spectral resolutions across the bi-temporal data. Extensive experiments conducted on the HVCD dataset demonstrate that our IFNet obtains state-of-the-art performance with an acceptable computational cost."

    "abstract": "To satisfy the increasing demands for wireless transmission rates, it is necessary to exploit spatial resources of electromagnetic (EM) waves. In this context, EM information theory (EIT) has emerged as a hot topic by integrating the theoretical framework of deterministic mathematics and stochastic statistics to explore the transmission mechanisms of continuous EM waves. However, the previous studies were primarily focused on the analysis of the spatial degrees of freedom, with limited exploration of a comprehensive understanding of the essential physical characteristics of EIT. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) line-of-sight channel capacity formula is proposed, which captures the vector EM physics and accommodates both near- and far-field scenes. A novel channel model is established based on the rigorous mathematical equation and the physical mechanism of fast multipole algorithm, and it is revealed that the scattered EM waves have finite angular spectral bandwidth, which determines the eigenvalue distributions of the communication system. Furthermore, a series of orthogonal basis are constructed for the currents on the transmitter and the fields on the receiving aperture, thus supporting the optimal design of the spatial precoder and combiner. Comprehensive analyses are made to investigate the relationship among the noise, transmitted power, and spatial degree of freedom, thereby establishing a rigorous upper bound of channel capacity. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model and numerical method. This work offers a novel perspective and methodology for comprehending and leveraging spatial resources of wireless channels, and provides a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the holographic communications."

For the missile, the successful evasion from the defender, i.e. the miss distance being larger than the defender's killing radius, is considered a prerequisite of attacking the target. For the evading phase, the differential-game-of-kind theory is used to give the escape zone described by the range in which the missile's guidance commands take values. The guidance laws of all players in the engagement are given by solving the differential-game-of-degree, with the value range obtained from the differential-game-of-kind serving as the feasible region for the missile. All players' guidance laws form the equilibrium solutions of the hybrid differential game in the three-player engagement. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the design."

    "abstract": "Surface flashover along the ceramic inside vacuum interrupters significantly degrades insulation performance. At present, increasing the ceramic length is the main approach used to improve insulation, but this inevitably leads to larger interrupter size and higher manufacturing costs. Therefore, enhancing the surface flashover voltage per unit length of ceramics under vacuum conditions is critical for downsizing vacuum interrupters, reducing costs, and improving reliability. In this study, a method involving the etching of periodic triangular grooves on the ceramic surface is proposed to improve vacuum surface flashover performance. A systematic investigation was conducted to study the influence of groove periodicity (ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.4 mm) on the surface flashover voltage of ceramics under direct current (DC) conditions. Additionally, a vacuum surface flashover simulation model was developed based on the Particle-In-Cell with Monte Carlo Collision (PIC-MCC) algorithm, and the suppression effect and underlying mechanism of surface grooves were analyzed in combination with experimental results. The findings indicate that surface microstructure design has strong potential for enhancing the vacuum surface flashover voltage of ceramics. Specifically, the breakdown voltage corresponding to a $\\mathbf{5 0 \\%}$ flashover probability was increased by more than $50 \\%$, offering a promising strategy for optimizing the structural design of ceramic enclosures in vacuum interrupters."

    "abstract": "Vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs) are favored in the medium voltage range due to their gas- and $\\mathbf{S F}_{6}$ - free, environmentally friendly operation and relatively low maintenance costs compared to other interrupters. To increase the operational voltage level, a common approach is to use a single or double break device. A classical solution for symmetrizing the voltage distribution over a single contact gap vacuum interrupter (VI) is to use a floating one-part or multipart shielding solution, even on floating potential, along with external grading capacitors. Similarly, for a double contact gap vacuum interrupter, a floating one-part or multi-part shielding solution is given, even on floating potential, and external grading capacitors can be used to balance the voltage distribution. This approach enhances the symmetry of the voltage distribution across the vacuum interrupter and the floating shielding [1]. To enhance overall dielectric performance, this paper presents the integration of additional field grading and shielding electrodes within single and double-breaking vacuum interrupters to symmetrize the voltage distribution [2, 3]. First, the shielding behaviour of the arrangement is analysed as such and “free-standing” and using a grounded flat metal electrode placed at 50 to 100 mm to disturb the symmetric field distribution [4, 5, 6]. Second, the symmetrizing behavior is analyzed through detailed electric field simulations of the grading components within the vacuum interrupter, both before and after implementing the novel design. The basic modular design of the novel vacuum interrupter arrangement is presented and investigated in detail using the EField simulation method. This paper explains how the design improves voltage distribution along the vacuum interrupter and maintains robustness even when an earthed environment is placed close to the interrupter."

    "abstract": "When closing a capacitor bank, high-frequency inrush currents generated in the circuit can cause prestrike phenomena in the vacuum interrupter, accompanied by the formation of prestrike arcs. These prestrike arcs can ablation the contact surface or lead to fusion welding, potentially causing re-strike or failure of the circuit breaking process in the vacuum interrupter. Experimental studies on the arc shape of high-frequency inrush currents prestrike arcs are of significant importance in understanding the impact of different contact materials on the prestrike arc shape during closing inrush currents. This paper is based on experiments conducted in a capacitive synthetic circuit laboratory, where two types of contact materials, $\\mathrm{CuCr30}$ and WCu10, are used in vacuum interrupters to investigate the classification of prestrike arc morphologies under high-frequency inrush currents. The prestrike arc shape is measured and analyzed at inrush current peak values of $5 \\mathrm{kA}, 10 \\mathrm{kA}$, and 20 kA, and the arc forms are categorized accordingly."

    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to investigate the external electric field distribution of high-voltage vacuum interrupters (VIs) encapsulated in metal tanks. The effects of geometric parameters, including shielding configurations, tank diameters, and shielding clearances on the external electric field distribution were determined in this work. A two-dimensional finite element model was established to simulate the electric field characteristics. Comparative studies were conducted on configurations with and without an external end shield, supplemented by parametric analyses of tank diameter and shielding clearance. Key findings reveal that the external end shield significantly reduces the maximum electric field intensity at the gas-solid-electrode triple junctions by $94.5 \\%$, demonstrating its critical role in the mitigating field concentrations. Furthermore, the tank diameter exhibits an inverse correlation with localized field magnitudes, while shielding clearance shows a positive correlation near triple junctions and an inverse correlation in distal regions. These results emphasize the importance of geometric optimization in balancing field uniformity and insulation reliability for tank-type VIs."

    "abstract": "The multi-terminal flexible DC distribution network is an effective means for the local consumption of a high proportion of renewable energy such as photovoltaic and wind power and for the highly reliable and flexible energy supply of the power system. The DC load switch is the key to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the DC distribution network. This paper proposes a mechanical DC breaking scheme with low cost, small size and high reliability. By regulating the arc voltage of the vacuum arc, a high-frequency oscillating current is generated between the main branch and the transfer branch to achieve rapid zero-crossing and breaking of the load current. First of all, build a topological structure simulation model and study the matching relationship of key parameters. Secondly, the characteristics of fast mechanical switches are studied, and the design methods of parameters such as opening and closing capacitors and charging voltages are proposed. Finally, a prototype of $\\pm \\mathbf{1 0 k V}$ mechanical DC load switch based on vacuum arc regulation is developed and experimental tests are conducted. The results show that the prototype can break the 3000A system current within 5 ms, meeting the engineering application requirements of DC load switches."

    "abstract": "Agriculture technology (AgTech) applies emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and artificial intelligence to collect, transmit, and process information related to agricultural enterprises. AgTech solutions involve many interconnected systems, each with a range of security vulnerabilities that may impact data trustworthiness. To engage AgTech effectively, a framework is necessary for providing assurances that data used for decision making can be trusted. This article introduces a novel framework “AgTrust” that provides a cohesive solution for enabling trust in farming ecosystems. This includes assurances of data integrity, data quality, and data provenance supported by anomaly detection, quantum-safe encryption, authentication, and the underlying key-management mechanisms. The AgTrust framework is a modular design, intended for flexibility to enable implementation in a range of context and to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving threat landscape using appropriate security mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness. The modules providing various security functions can be adapted to future-proof the AgTech development and can be applied to other IoT or smart-device-based networks. The AgTrust framework specifies the functionality required across various layers and services and coordinates interactions between functions. Four case study examples related to the implementation of the AgTrust framework in real-world scenarios are presented and discussed."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of generative AI (Gen AI), e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Newegg are adopting AI-generated summaries (AIGS) to synthesize online reviews. We analytically study the transformative impact of AIGS one commerce with competing retailers by examining its two key effects: the convenience effect, which reduces consumers' reading costs to access review information, and the filtering effect, which aids consumers in making more informed purchase decisions. Retailers differ in their market reputation (MR), and not all consumers in the market trust AIGS. Our findings suggest that the convenience effect and the filtering effect influence competition in opposite ways. When consumer trust in AIGS is high, its adoption may intensify price competition. We further show that moderately high consumer trust in AIGS enables its adoption to create an all-win outcome for both the platform and competing retailers. Surprisingly, we find that while high trust in AIGS can reinforce high-MR retailers' advantages (a Matthew effect), the adoption of AIGS under low trust may instead reshape market competition by narrowing these advantages. Interestingly, when AIGS is fully trusted and adoption costs are moderate, it improves social welfare but may lower consumer surplus due to elevated prices."

They have multiple stability strategies at their disposal, but it remains unclear how these different strategies compensate for one another when one may be limited due to external factors. The objective of the current study was to determine how the different stability strategies compensate for one another when mediolateral perturbations were applied. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Methods:</i> We performed both human experiments and computational modelling. The human experiments involved imposed restrictions on the different stability strategies while perturbations were applied and measuring the response of the other strategies. The stepping strategy was limited using visual feedback of step width projected onto the ground, the ankle strategy was restricted using narrow strips of rubber under the foot, and the trunk strategy was restricted using a brace. Similarly, in the computational model, we observed changes in the remaining strategies once one of the balance strategies was removed. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Results:</i> In our gait study, we found that the limitation of one strategy did not result in compensatory behaviour in the remaining strategies.

    "abstract": "The increasing share of renewable energy sources in electricity generation has reduced the presence of conventional rotating machines while increasing the share of converter-connected units. As a result, the overall system strength and inertia are reduced, making power systems more vulnerable to instability. To ensure reliable and secure operation, new technologies and novel, fast-acting ancillary services are being considered to replicate the inherent behavior of synchronous generators. Among the potential solutions, supercapacitor-based energy storage systems stand out due to their unique characteristics, particularly their ability to deliver rapid power support. This paper provides a comprehensive review of supercapacitor technology with a focus on applications in power systems. It examines their advantages and limitations, evaluates the shortcomings of existing studies, and summarizes the main performance metrics and integration possibilities. In addition, this paper also highlights research contributions that explore the use of supercapacitors for frequency-related as well as non-frequency ancillary services. Key challenges are identified, and directions for future research are proposed, with the aim of advancing the role of supercapacitors in enhancing power system stability."

    "abstract": "3D terrain reconstruction with satellite imagery achieves cost-effective and large-scale earth observation and is crucial for safeguarding natural disasters, monitoring ecological changes, and preserving the environment. Recently, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods have shown promise in this task. However, these methods simply modify the general learning-based MVS framework for height estimation, which overlooks the terrain characteristics and results in insufficient accuracy. Considering that the Earth’s surface generally undulates without drastic changes and can be measured by slope, integrating slope considerations into MVS frameworks could enhance the accuracy of terrain reconstruction. To this end, we propose an end-to-end slope-aware height estimation network named TS-SatMVSNet for large-scale remote sensing terrain reconstruction. To effectively obtain the slope representation, drawing from mathematical gradient concepts, we innovatively proposed a height-based slope calculation strategy to first calculate a slope map from a height map to measure the terrain undulation. To fully integrate slope information into the MVS pipeline, we separately design two slope-guided modules to enhance reconstruction outcomes. Specifically, we designed a slope-guided interval partition module for refined height estimation using slope values. And, a height correction module is proposed, using a learnable Gaussian smoothing operator to amend the inaccurate height values. Additionally, to enhance the efficacy of height estimation, we proposed a slope direction loss for implicitly optimizing height estimation results. Extensive experiments on the WHU-TLC dataset and MVS3D dataset show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates competitive generalization ability compared to all listed methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/StriveZs/TS-SatMVSNet."

    "abstract": "In complex battlefield environments where adversarial attacks are frequent and UAV swarms are vulnerable to interference, the communication topology is prone to damage. To ensure the mission success rate of UAV swarms, optimizing network robustness is particularly important. In this context, this paper presents a study on enhancing the coordination capability of UAV swarms under enemy attacks and interference by implementing a zone-based isolation management method, a preventive optimization method based on a hierarchical simulated annealing algorithm (HSA) with small-world network characteristics, and a recovery optimization method based on a temporary leader mechanism. A communication topology model for UAV swarms is also established.The partitioned isolation management method divides the overall topology into multiple connected sub-topologies, thereby limiting the impact of faults or attacks within a specific area. The hierarchical simulated annealing method based on small-world networks optimizes the network topology within interference regions, reducing internal links while maintaining overall connectivity. In addition, when the topology is damaged, temporary leaders are selected to maintain the integrity of the remaining topology.Simulation results indicate that the proposed preventive robustness optimization method can effectively enhance the robustness of the communication network. The recovery optimization method maintains the connectivity of the remaining swarm topology and enables the reestablishment of the flocking state, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed robustness optimization approaches."

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial in intelligent transportation systems for mitigating congestion and enhancing intelligent traffic management. Although recent methods have shown excellent performance, they still encounter two major limitations: (i) Existing models face challenges in balancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. (ii) Existing spatial modeling methods use unified mechanisms to model all nodes, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity among them. To address these limitations, we propose a spatio-temporal architecture, TA-CSA for traffic prediction, which consists of Temporal Aggregation Pooling (TAP) and Clustered Spatial Attention (CSA). Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design the temporal aggregation pooling module. This module extracts temporal features from multiple time windows through parallel pooling operations, thereby strengthening the model’s capacity to capture global temporal trends and dynamic fluctuations. In the spatial dimension, we introduce clustered spatial attention. The method employs hierarchical clustering to divide nodes with similar functional characteristics into the same cluster and performs local attention calculations to achieve regional-level spatial perception. Extensive experiments on six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TA-CSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both routine and long-horizon forecasting tasks."

Such sets are in particular interesting in the context of multi-objective multimodal optimization (MMO). To this end, we first propose a bounded archiver, ArchiveUpdateLQ,∈B, that is, a modification of a previously proposed unbounded archiver. These archivers can be used as external archivers to in principle any multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). In order to reduce the computational cost compared to such archive equipped MOEAs, we propose, in a next step LQ,∈MOEA. This evolutionary algorithm directly uses ArchiveUpdateLQ,∈B for the selection process and hence does not need an external archive for the computation of ∈-locally optimal solutions. We further propose a hybrid of LQ,∈MOEA with a multi-objective continuation method, which significantly improves the accuracy of the obtained solutions in case the gradient information is at hand. Finally, we show some numerical results that demonstrate the benefit of both the bounded archiver and the new MOEAs."

In particular, for 2-D arrays on planar grids and continuous aperture sources with circular support, we identify the minimum source size required to achieve a given mask-constrained performance and, subsequently, synthesize such a source. Conversely, the proposed method can also determine and achieve the optimal performance attainable by a source of fixed size. The approach, based solely on convex programming and polynomial factorization, can accommodate completely arbitrary upper and lower bounds on the radiated power pattern. As such, it constitutes the first method capable of solving this problem without any restriction on the beam shape and footprint while completely avoiding the use of global optimization algorithms. The results from representative test cases demonstrate the ability of the method to find sources with provably minimal size, leading to significant reductions in the number of array elements compared with alternative designs. The effectiveness of the approach is further confirmed by the successful incorporation of full-wave simulated radiating elements, including mutual coupling effects."

Existing dual watermarking techniques are designed for single-view images and lack adaptability to the multi-view structure and geometric consistency of LF images, making it difficult to simultaneously address integrity verification and ownership verification for LF images. Given the multi-view characteristics and geometric consistency of LF images, there is an urgent need for a highly robust and adaptable dual watermarking method. Therefore, we propose a dual verification framework with customizable watermarking, called DeVIL, which specifically designed for LF images and enables both ownership and integrity verification. By embedding reversible ownership watermarks into the sub-aperture images (SAIs), affiliation can be verified after transmission. Among them, the embedding technique can flexibly choose either a reversible robust watermarking technique or a robust zero-watermarking technique based on different application scenarios. Subsequently, we perform Arnold transformation on key SAIs and embed them into non-key SAIs to create stego images, effectively reducing the risk of information leakage. Furthermore, integrity watermarks are embedded in the stego images, forming stego images with integrity watermarks to detect subtle tampering during transmission. Experimental results show that DeVIL can successfully recover SAIs and demonstrates strong robustness and adaptability against various attacks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, DeVIL reduces the average bit error rate by 9.32% under different attacks, with average normalized cross-correlation improvement of 0.17, significantly enhancing the robustness of ownership protection in different datasets."

    "abstract": "Metal particles generated under high-current conditions can significantly degrade the insulation performance of vacuum interrupters. Therefore, studying the dynamical behavior of these particles during the post-arc phase is of great importance. Driven by electric field forces, metal particles move between electrodes and undergo charge exchange upon colliding with them. This study employs experimental methods to investigate the charging characteristics of metal particles after electrode collisions, as well as the variation in their charge during movement across the electrode gap. The experimental results show that the amount of charge acquired by a particle after colliding with an electrode is positively correlated with the instantaneous macroscopic AC uniform electric field strength at the moment of impact. Once the particle detaches from the electrode and travels through the gap before the next collision, the charge it carries remains approximately constant. Furthermore, a particle that carries a charge of opposite polarity to the electrode will experience a reversal in charge polarity upon collision with the electrode. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the numerical simulation of metal particle dynamics during the post-arc phase in vacuum interrupters and contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying delayed breakdowns induced by such particles."

    "abstract": "For most applications in medium voltage switchgears, vacuum interrupters are used. The switching arc during interruption processes in vacuum appearing at the mechanical contact separation is evaporated from the contact electrodes. Near the current zero crossing the arc gets instable due to decreasing energy input and can chop abruptly [1], [2]. This can be critical especially at low currents in inductive load circuits: The high current gradient induces transient overvoltages at the load, which can exceed the insulation strength and cause damages [3]. Also, secondary effects like disturbance emissions might affect safety-relevant components like protection relays in terms of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). The arc chopping is characterized by the chopping current Ich, which represents the instantaneous value of the power frequency current before its interruption. To reduce this current two measures are considered in more detail. By a proper choice of the switching contact materials the arc should be maintained until current zero crossing. For the material properties this means a lowered evaporation temperature of the contact material. Optimized copper-based contact materials with additives of carbide and carbon show chopping values between $I_{\\mathrm{ch}}=0.5 \\mathrm{~A}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{ch}}=3 \\mathrm{~A}$. In line with [4]–[7], this work also examines the influence of superimposed (externally generated) axial magnetic fields on the arc chopping behavior. Measurements for the investigated copper-based materials indicate no optimization (reduction of $\\left.I_{\\mathrm{ch}}\\right)$ due to the additional magnetic field. For a better classification of the chopping behavior a statistical evaluation is performed. This is necessary since $I_{c h}$ shows significant scattering even at constant test conditions. For the statistical analysis each series of measurements under constant flux density is performed with a predefined number of measurements (interruption operations). The median chopping currents and outliers of a vacuum chamber with superimposed magnetic field are evaluated. Additionally, for switching operations without applied magnetic field, a probability distribution of all $I_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ values is considered."

The proposed unit provides group delays of −5.5 and −2.4 ns at 1.86 and 2.78 GHz, respectively, representing significantly enhanced compensation capability compared with prior reports. By embedding this NGD unit into a conventional SSPP waveguide, both Gaussian pulses and double-sideband (DSB)-modulated signals are effectively compensated, leading to envelope advancement and reduced propagation delay. The results confirm that the proposed dual-band NGD mechanism broadens the functionalities of SSPP systems and offers strong potential for applications in high-speed communication, synchronous transmission, and real-time sensing."

    "abstract": "As a vital resource for the Earth’s ecological environment, effective extraction of surface water has a profound impact on human livelihoods and socio-economic development. Currently, water indices based on satellite imagery are widely used for surface water extraction. However, their accuracy remains significantly limited in complex scenarios—such as urban areas with high- and low-reflectivity buildings and shadow interference, sediment-laden or eutrophic water bodies, and intricate water–land transition zones. These limitations typically manifest in the failure to detect smaller water bodies, unclear water edges, and the presence of surrounding noise. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel and practical water-body index—the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel Water Index (HLSWI)—based on the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 dataset. HLSWI integrates the complementary spectral characteristics of the Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors and optimizes classification thresholds via the ISO-Data clustering algorithm. HLSWI’s effectiveness is assessed through comparisons with seven commonly adopted water indices across 14 study areas worldwide and three representative complex scenarios, covering various surface types, including wetlands, arid zones, and urban aquatic environments. Experimental findings indicate that HLSWI outperforms the other seven water indices, reducing total water extraction errors by an average of 1.18% to 5.55% and improving overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient by 1.42%–3.63% and 0.02–0.05, respectively. Therefore, HLSWI serves as a simple yet effective tool for surface water detection using optical remote sensing imagery and provides essential technical support for water extraction in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Achieving color consistency is essential for stitching large-area optical satellite imagery. The narrow swath width of individual images, combined with varying acquisition conditions, inherently introduces color differences. These manifest as marked disparities in brightness, color tone, and local contrast, degrading overall regional consistency. Existing methods primarily focus on correcting color inconsistencies between adjacent images, while often overlooking intra-image illumination non-uniformity, thereby propagating radiometric errors into optimization frameworks. Whisk-broom sensors, which can acquire imagery over a much wider swath width along the parallels, frequently exhibit substantial intra-image brightness variations, particularly in high-latitude regions. Compounded by frequent cloud cover and rapid temporal changes of features, extracting reliable color correspondences for optimization becomes intractable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel color correction framework that simultaneously considers intra-image illumination non-uniformity and radiometric variations caused by cloud prevalence and dynamic surface changes. First, a solar elevation angle map is extracted for down-sampled source image based on their geographic metadata and sensor geometry. An inverse compensation based on the normalized sine value of the solar elevation angle is then applied to mitigate brightness disparities caused by varying incident radiance. Second, to address atmospheric effects that vary with wavelength, such as differential absorption and scattering that cause color casts especially in low-illumination regions, a reference spectral channel is selected to guide the correction. Finally, we introduce a hybrid strategy for selecting reliable color correspondences in overlapping regions, using both grayscale and texture similarity under complex coverage conditions. Residual radiometric information is incorporated into a cost function, which jointly considers original color control and overall color balance to enhance the global consistency of the corrected mosaic. Extensive experiments conducted on imagery from the Wide Swath Imager (WSI) of DaQi-1 (DQ-1) and the Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) of HaiYang-1E (HY-1E) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively removes uneven illumination and color discrepancies. Compared to three state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves superior performance in both visual quality and quantitative metrics."

    "abstract": "Electrical experts can readily diagnose high-severity faults in permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) using a few samples of harmonic order data in the time-frequency domain, leveraging their prior knowledge of interturn short circuits, local demagnetization, and mixed faults. However, traditional harmonic analysis methods are often hindered by low signal amplitude, noise, and overlap with various operating conditions, which present significant challenges for intelligent fault detection and identification models. Moreover, the high similarity between healthy and faulty signatures, combined with the scarcity of faulty samples across diverse operating scenarios, leads to high misclassification rates in conventional FDI models. To address these challenges, this article proposes an explainable few-shot learning architecture that integrates symmetrical components and harmonic analysis to classify incipient faults using only a small number of samples under multiple operating conditions. A convolutional neural network–based attention mechanism is employed to extract physical features of PMSGs in both normal and abnormal states. The proposed model achieves 89% accuracy with 20 shots, outperforming the pretrained ResNet50 (43%) on a 4320 sample PMSG dataset. The precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are used for validating the predictions. Additionally, by incorporating physical domain knowledge, the model can generate interpretable predictions with visual explanations of its inference process, aligning with the transparency and accountability principles mandated by the EU AI Act for high-risk systems in the energy sector."

    "abstract": "Multicore processors have emerged as the preferred architecture for safetycritical systems due to their significant performance advantages. However, concurrent access by multiple cores to a shared cache induces intercore evictions that generate nondeterministic interference and compromise timing predictability. Static partitioning of the cache among cores is a wellestablished countermeasure that effectively eliminates such evictions but reduces flexibility and system throughput. To accurately estimate inter-core cache contention, Auxiliary Tag Directories (ATDs) are widely adopted. However, ATDs incur substantial hardware area costs, which often motivates the use of heuristic-based reductions. These reduced ATD designs, while more compact, compromise accuracy and therefore are not suitable for safety-critical domains. This paper extends the proposal of HashTAG, a novel approach to accurately upper-bound inter-core eviction interference. HashTAG introduces a safe and lightweight Auxiliary Tag Directory mechanism that tracks which cores are responsible for evicting cache lines used by others, thus measuring contention. We further refine the proposed HashTAG approach by creating CALM, a custom-made memory allocator that significantly improves HashTAG performance in multicore systems. Our results show that no inter-task interference underprediction is possible with HashTAG, making it suitable for the safety domain. HashTAG provides a 47% reduction in the Auxiliary Tag Directory area, presenting perfect measurements on 80% of cases and only a 1% error on maximum inter-core eviction measurements for a HashTAG tag size of ten bits."

    "abstract": "The shared anatomy among different human bodies can serve as a strong prior for effectively leveraging unlabeled data in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Inspired by the success of masked image modeling, we notice that this prior can be explicitly realized by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised gross anatomy reconstruction task into a teacher-student semi-supervised segmentation framework. In this auxiliary task, consistency is maintained between the student's predictions on masked images and the teacher's predictions on the original images. Despite its potential, we observe that the reconstruction difficulties of different organs/tissues can vary significantly and therefore reconstructing them requires tailored learning strategies. To address this issue, we introduce a difficulty-adapted mask mechanism based on the teacher-student framework, wherein the reconstruction difficulty is adapted to facilitate training. Specifically, we control the reconstruction difficulty by modulating two important factors: masked region ratio and masked class ratio. Accordingly, we design two corresponding mask strategies. 1) Region-based masking: randomly masks a fraction of each class according to an automatically computed mask ratio. 2) Class-based masking: masks the entire regions of the specific classes according to the class confidence predicted by the teacher model. During training, a conflict-aware gradient computation strategy is introduced to mitigate potential optimization conflicts arising from modulating the two reconstruction factors simultaneously.

However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This article defines the multiobjective agricultural multielectrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task-sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA’s superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA’s competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multirobot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation."

    "abstract": "The practical deployment of object detectors is often hindered by a gap between standard academic metrics and real-world requirements—namely, performance at a specific operating threshold, cost-asymmetric errors, and performance stability under distribution shifts. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Cost-Stability Evaluation Framework (CSEF), a systematic workflow that transforms the selection of a model and its operating threshold from a heuristic practice to a rational, data-driven decision process. CSEF operationalizes user-defined requirements—an IoU threshold (τ) for localization accuracy; a cost asymmetry parameter (β) that serves as the recall-to-precision weight in the F-beta score; and a maximum tolerable performance degradation (σ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">req</sub>)—to algorithmically recommend the most operationally reliable model–threshold pair. CSEF first selects the threshold that maximizes the F-beta score on the validation set, and then quantifies robustness as the relative change in the F-beta score, σ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deg</sub>, from the validation set to an unseen held-out test set.

It is now critical for them to correctly manage their data in order to come up with fresh business ideas and get the greatest outcomes. As a result, it becomes critical to precisely predict the fares. The motive of this paper is to compare all the fare details of specified cabs and predict the lowest fare cab using linear regression method. In this paper we implemented prediction model for the three models like Uber Go, Go Sedan and Uber Auto. Here deviation of the cab fares also compared and using these data, build an application that can assist the users to select the cab with the determined benefits and lowest fare. In this model we use machine learning technique of linear Regression model, and it may contain labelled data. Here the methodology and outcomes of this work can contribute to a more real-world demand. This application can improve the transport accessibility, reduce waiting time and reduce the transportation fare etc."

    "abstract": "Delayed breakdown in high-voltage vacuum circuit breakers has emerged as a critical challenge to reliable current interruption and is increasingly attributed to the influence of metal particles. The intense energy injection during high-current vacuum arcs can induce vigorous boiling on the cathode surface, leading to the emission of large, slow-moving, high-temperature metal particles. These particles may act as potential triggers for post-arc restrikes. In this study, a laser shadow technique was employed to experimentally observe the continuous motion of cathode molten pool particles under realistic interruption conditions. Both the overall motion characteristics and representative particle trajectories were extracted and analyzed. The results show that particle dynamics are strongly influenced by arc plasma forces, and that prolonged cathode molten pool particle residence in the post-arc gap may interfere with dielectric recovery. This work provides experimental evidence for the role of metal particles in delayed breakdown mechanisms and offers valuable insights for improving the interruption performance of high-voltage vacuum breakers."

With future spacecraft power systems advancing towards higher voltage and higher power levels, the vacuum flashover issue of polyimide is anticipated to become more severe. To address these challenges, this study fabricated specialty polyimide films incorporating sulfur (SO-PI) and fluorine (CF-PI). Utilizing a custom three-parameter evaluation methodology based on the first breakdown voltage ($U_{\\mathrm{fb}}$), conditioned voltage ($U_{\\mathrm{co}}$), and hold-off voltage ($U_{\\mathrm{ho}}$), the surface insulation performance of these materials under vacuum was systematically characterized. Experimental results demonstrate that the specialty films exhibit significantly reduced surface charge accumulation and a higher withstand voltage threshold compared to commercial polyimide. Notably, the $\\boldsymbol{U}_{\\mathrm{fb}}$ value of CF-PI showed a $24.74 \\%$ improvement over that of commercial PI. This research provides valuable insights for the design of insulating materials in high-voltage space power systems."

    "abstract": "During interruption, vacuum circuit breakers generate intense arc energy that erodes the contact surfaces, severely impairing their interruption success rate and electrical lifespan. Aging tests cannot fully remove residual air from the contact surfaces, and this trapped oxygen markedly alters the erosion mechanisms.This study compares erosion characteristics under two conditions-residual air in the arc chamber (as in aging tests) versus an ideal vacuum-with a focus on how oxygen content influences contact erosion. We developed an oxidation-kinetics model for contact erosion by modifying the momentum-conservation equation and treating the dissolved oxygen concentration in the molten metal as a function of temperature. The model accounts for changes in surface-tension coefficients caused by dissolved oxygen, which drive Marangoni flows and reshape the molten crater, as well as the resulting variations in droplet size and ejection angle.By contrasting the two environments, we examined differences in crater morphology, mass - loss rate, and splashed - droplet characteristics. Our results show that as vacuum level increases, both erosion morphology and erosion rate change significantly. In lower - vacuum (higher - pressure) conditions, oxygen participation leads to relatively shallower erosion depths. Conversely, in higher - vacuum environments - where gas molecules are scarce-the erosion depth increases, while droplet sizes decrease and ejection angles narrow."

This not only captures short-term fluctuations in customer behavior but also reveals periodic behaviors and long-term trends, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer behavior characteristics. Additionally, we propose a position encoding method that combines time series length and embedding dimensions to enhance the model's ability to perceive the distance between different time points. Experimental results show that, compared to other baseline models, the CPBBCformer model outperforms the competing models on relevant public datasets, validating its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the deepening process of global economic integration, the economic systems of various countries have formed a closely interconnected situation. This interdependence has greatly promoted the evolution and innovation of the supply chain system. In the face of increasingly fierce market competition, enterprises at all links of the supply chain are actively exploring more efficient development paths to enhance overall competitiveness. This study focuses on the equilibrium problem of a dual-channel supply chain hypernetwork under random demand conditions, aiming to provide scientific decision support for supply chain participants. The supply chain hypernetwork model constructed in this study includes four key levels: suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and end consumers. Based on the traditional supply chain architecture, this study particularly introduces the direct sales channel of manufacturers, enabling them to sell products directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms; at the same time, retailers adopt a hybrid sales model combining online and offline. To address the uncertainty of consumer demand, a random demand model is adopted to enhance the practical applicability of the research. Through a systematic analysis of the decision-making elements of participants at each level, this study establishes the corresponding optimal decision objective function and transforms it into an equilibrium model through the variational inequality method. This research not only expands the research scope of traditional supply chain theory but also provides a new analytical framework for strategic decision-making of enterprises in complex market environments."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of e-commerce, JD.com has expanded its market share through a series of promotional strategies. However, different promotional methods have varying impacts on consumer purchasing behavior. This article studies the use of K-means clustering to divide sub samples based on customer characteristics and apply a multi model comparison method to predict the response of JD users with different characteristics to sales promotion. Specifically, customers were segmented into three clusters, labeling high-value customers, potential consumers, and regular customers. Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models were trained for each group. Results show that the Random Forest Regression achieves the best performance overall in predicting click-to-order conversion rates, with MSE of 0.020066, 0.020228 and 0.020878 in the test set of the three clusters. The analysis of feature importance finds that the ‘direct_discount_ratio’ is a key factor affecting purchasing decisions. In addition, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) analysis further reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between direct discounts and ‘click_order_ratio’. This discovery emphasizes the widespread effectiveness of direct discounts in stimulating purchasing desires among various types of users. The study provides data-driven decision support for e-commerce platforms, which has important practical significance and helps optimize promotional strategies and enhance investment returns."

Baseline dimensions for patch length, width and effective permittivity are derived from classical cavity model equations, followed by antenna refinement in CST Studio Suite via the finite integration technique transient solver. The cut-out is first left unfilled and then successively loaded with n-type germanium inserts at four doping concentrations to assess material-filled slot tuning. Simulation results show that a lightly doped Ge fill shifts the fundamental resonance upward by approximately 1.3 GHz and expands the bandwidth from 4 % to 7 % while the far-field pattern remains essentially unchanged. Heavier doping offers little additional benefit but preserves beam pointing and side-lobe levels. Although the Ge insert reduces realized gain by ~3 dB, it provides a fabrication friendly route to bandwidth enhancement without multilayer stacking or footprint growth. The findings supply practical guidance for compact millimeter-wave Wi-Fi and short-range radar front ends that require wider bandwidth yet can accommodate a moderate gain trade-off."

The development of smart, eco-friendly diesel generators and the application of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms for optimizing control and reducing emissions are becoming increasingly important in industrial automation. In this study, the autoformer neural network framework was developed and adopted to diesel generator for solid particles prognosis. Vibration, sound, and thermal images of exhaust gases were used as input parameters for the autoformer’s predictions. Generator was loaded with 0.0 kW, 0.3 kW, 0.6 kW, 1.0 kW, 1.3 kW, 1.6 kW, and 2.0 kW power and particle sizes of 0.3 µm, 0.5 µm, 1.0 µm, 2.5 µm, 5.0 µm, and 10.0 µm were measured in exhausted gases. The developed autoformer model showed the best results when the generator was working with loaded 0.6 kW power, the MAPE were 2.7%, 4.6%, 2.4%, 0.9%, 2.2%, and 0.9% for 0.3 µm, 0.5 µm, 1.0 µm, 2.5 µm, 5.0 µm, and 10.0 µm sized particles, respectively. Despite the fact that the accuracy of the autoformer should be better under other generator load conditions.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the possibilities of using MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) theory for analyzing the behavior of an electric arc, with the use of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software tools. These software packages are based on the finite element theory, with the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This approach treats the electric arc as a conductive fluid, including all its electromagnetic properties. The simulation was conducted using Ansys Fluent software, through the built-in MHD module, as well as user-defined functions (UDFs). As an example, an initialized plasma channel of an electric arc was considered based on a model found in the literature, which was simplified to save computational resources and simulation time. The model includes the anode, cathode, and the so-called \"splitter,\" which serves to separate the arc, cool it down, and increase its resistance. The movement of the arc is demonstrated through natural dynamics caused by temperature increases, as well as forced movement due to the Lorentz force from an external magnetic field. Due to these factors, the electric arc moves upward through the geometry design, increasing its length, after which separation and cooling occur, significantly reducing the conductivity of the plasma channel as its length increases. The surrounding medium is air. The paper covers all necessary aspects of modeling the electric arc, as well as the selection of appropriate physical models that describe the properties of air during the arc’s duration. This simulation demonstrates the potential use of the aforementioned theory for analyzing various geometries of switching equipment in alternating and direct current systems, which could serve as a significant complement to practical experiments."

In order to improve the breaking performance of VI, this paper takes $27.5 \\mathrm{kV} / 2500 \\mathrm{~A} / 31.5 \\mathrm{kA}$ vacuum circuit breaker as the research object, optimizes the contact structure by combining support vector regression and grey wolf optimizer (GWO-SVR). Firstly, the central composite design method is used to construct different contact structure parameters (slot length of contact piece, slot width of contact piece, slot deflection angle of contact piece, inclined slot depth, and cup seat thickness). The magnetic field strength of the center surface of the different contact structure parameters at the peak current is calculated by the finite element method. Then, the GWO-SVR model is constructed with the contact structure parameters as the input, and the maximum magnetic field strength and the radial kurtosis value of the central surface between the poles as the output. Finally, the GWO-SVR model is optimized by NSGA-II to obtain the optimal contact structure parameters and improve the control ability of the axial magnetic field to the vacuum arc."

Experiments employed a demountable vacuum chamber with axial magnetic contacts under high-vacuum conditions. During multiple TCC discharges at controlled parameters, arc dynamics were captured using high-speed imaging with precise synchronization. Key findings demonstrate: Strong spatial correlation between initial breakdown sites and sustained arcing positions after current-holding phases, confirming consistent weak-spot targeting; Progressive redistribution of breakdown locations across the contact surface with successive discharges; Evolution from localized to homogeneous energy deposition, achieving comprehensive surface coverage after sufficient discharge cycles. The TCC methodology demonstrates three critical advantages: precise spatial targeting of insulation weaknesses, controlled energy deposition at identified defect sites, and progressive homogenization of surface processing. These mechanisms collectively enable complete conditioning coverage."

To enhance the withstand voltage performance of such gaps, this paper investigates the feasibility of ion implantation as a surface modification technique for the shields. In this study, 304 stainless steel was used as the substrate, into which Mo and Ta ions were respectively implanted. DC breakdown experiments were subsequently conducted across vacuum gaps of $0.5 \\mathrm{~mm}, 3$ mm, and 5 mm. The results indicate that ion implantation can effectively increase the initial breakdown voltage of the gaps. Surface analysis reveals the underlying mechanisms: ion implantation modifies the crystal phase composition of the electrode surface, improves the uniformity of surface hardness, and elevates the surface work function. This paper confirms the potential of ion implantation for enhancing vacuum insulation performance and points out the challenges for its application in vacuum interrupters."

The experiments at HVPTF focus on investigating and understanding the phenomena associated with in-vacuum discharge events occurring between high-voltage electrodes, with the goal of mitigating or preventing breakdown occurrences. The facility features a cylindrical vacuum chamber equipped with moveable supports for two electrodes. Two independent power supplies provide voltage differentials up to 800 kV DC, with current and voltage signals being monitored during experiments, as well as the pressure within the chamber and the composition of gases exiting it. Additionally, multiple lines of sight enable the installation of various diagnostics around the chamber, allowing for comprehensive observation of the dynamics of emissions during discharge events across visible, IR, UV, and X-ray spectra. Past works have presented analyses of the X-ray radiation coming out of the chamber, mainly caused by the Bremsstrahlung effect of the electrons travelling in the volume. Different aspects of the experiments were considered, and tentative explanations were brought forward. Some recent advancements in the development of the diagnostic and control systems of the experiment have given the chance to obtain more accurate and reproducible results. At the same time, the realization of a simulation environment, based on the combined use of multiple software has been proposed, for the modeling of the various processes involved in micro-discharges. This paper presents the basis for the development of the simulation model, focusing on the interchange of charged particles and photons between the electrodes. The coefficients required for the balance equation of the model are presented and calculated, with a display of the results."

The Joule heating effect, surface tension, and the dynamic changes of the effective radius for the cathode-plasma interaction are considered in the model. And the minimum current density threshold required to maintain stable operation is introduced to judge whether the spot is extinguished. The simulation results show that under the premise of constant current, when the effective radius for the cathode-plasma interaction exceeds its initial value, the continuous increase of the effective radius will cause the current density peak to gradually decrease. The reduction in the current density peak directly leads to a reduction in pressure acting on the cathode surface. It slows down the expansion rate of the cathode spot in the later stage of development. When the current density peak drops below the minimum current density threshold, the temperature at the center of the cathode spot may not reach the melting point. And the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results, which verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the model."

Remote sensing is suggested to be a capable proxy to provide independent, reliable, and regular observations on global gas flaring. Multiple satellite sensors, especially nighttime imagers, have been used to detect and characterize gas flares. However, the hundred-meter level coarse resolution of current nighttime sensors impacts the accuracy of detection and estimation with small fires undetected. In this study, we explore the potential of high resolution multi-spectral SDGSAT-1 Glimmer Imager for Urbanization (GIU) data and we propose a fine-grained gas flaring detection and estimation method based on the visible optical structure zones of gas flares. The study area of this work locates mainly in eight Persian Gulf countries. Existences, locations, volumes, and extents of gas flares within the study area are captured and analyzed. The proposed method achieves a detection accuracy of 90.46% with 891 active fire sites correctly recognized. Comparisons with Daytime Approach for gas Flaring Investigation (DAFI) V2 data show that our method generates less miss-detection especially when detecting small-sized gas flares, which demonstrates the utility of high resolution nighttime imagery and the proposed optical-based method."

Despite the advancements in VLMs facilitating basic visual dialog and reasoning, a performance gap persists compared to advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini. We propose a novel approach to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance across various cross-modal tasks. It tackles the following questions: (1) How can high-resolution visual tokens improve image understanding without lengthening the token sequence? (2) How to improve reasoning and generation abilities of VLM with high-quality data? (3) How to close the gap between open-source VLMs and proprietary models on reasoning-driven generation? In particular, to enhance visual tokens, we propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution refinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a high-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In general, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current frameworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously. The proposed model supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B, which achieve leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models. It is demonstrated to attain 80.6% accuracy on the MMB benchmark (+5.4 vs Gemini Pro) and 74.1% on TextVQA (+4.6 vs LLaVA-NeXT), achieving leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks and even surpasses the developed private models.

Multi-modal fusion has shown great potential for enhancing LCC performance, for example, by combining optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to leverage their complementary strengths. However, two key challenges hinder effective fusion: <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</i>) local geometric mismatches caused by distinct imaging geometries, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</i>) inconsistent reliability (the ability of a modality to deliver accurate and stable information) in LCC arising from different modalities and their acquisition conditions. To address these issues, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Fusion with Adaptive Geometric Correction (UAG), which comprises three main components. First, the Adaptive Geometric Correction Module (AGCM) applies learnable pixel shifts to establish bidirectional local correlations between multiscale optical and SAR features, thereby mitigating spatial inconsistencies. Second, the Adaptive Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Fusion Module (ADFM) employs evidential deep learning to model uncertainty, defined as the extent of reliability deficiency, for each modality using the Dirichlet distribution and subjective logic, enabling confidence-aware feature weighting. Third, a lightweight multiscale decoder integrates hierarchical features through a hybrid MLP-convolutional architecture, improving both segmentation efficiency and accuracy. We evaluate UAG on WHU-OPT-SAR and DFC23 datasets, where experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

We collect the personality annotation for the IEMOCAP dataset, making it the first speech dataset that contains both emotion and personality annotations (PA-IEMOCAP), and enabling direct integration of personality traits into SER. Statistical analysis on this dataset identified significant correlations between per sonality traits and emotional expressions. To extract finegrained personality features, we propose a temporal interaction condition network (TICN), in which personality features are integrated with HuBERT-based acoustic features for SER. Experiments show that incorporating ground-truth personality traits significantly enhances valence recognition, improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) from 0.698 to 0.785 compared to the baseline without personality information. For practical applications in dialogue systems where personality information about the user is unavailable, we develop a front-end module of automatic personality recognition. Using these automatically predicted traits as inputs to our proposed TICN model, we achieve a CCC of 0.776 for valence recognition, representing an 11.17% relative improvement over the baseline. These findings confirm the effectiveness of personality-aware SER and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in personality-aware speech processing applications."

To simultaneously handle all these critical aspects in a unified framework, this paper proposes a novel robust distributed time-delay control strategy which ensures the VC of autonomous connected HST under variable inter-train spacing policy which accounts for the effective convoy conditions. This is also guaranteed in the presence of variations in the active communication links as a result of cooperative manoeuvres. By exploiting matrix theory and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii approach, we derive the control gains tuning procedure and the exponential stability conditions, which are expressed as a set of feasible delay-dependent Linear Matrix Inequalities. These latter allow analytically evaluating the stability margin of the VC convoy with respect to uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics and the maximum allowable delay upper bound, as well as ensuring, based on a desired exponential decay rate, that the closed-loop state trajectories remain bounded within a safe region. Theoretical derivation is confirmed by an extensive simulation campaign, also including different railways cooperative maneuvers, Monte Carlo analysis and comparative evaluation against an alternative strategy."

However, planning the trajectories of UAV formation in complex and unknown environments, while ensuring obstacle avoidance and formation maintenance, presents unpreceding challenges. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning algorithm for UAV formation. This algorithm implements two-timescale trajectory planning within a leader-follower control framework, where the leader UAV (LUAV) plans the shortest safe trajectory to the hotspot area on a large timescale and the follower UAVs (FUAVs) are responsible for obstacle avoidance and formation maintenance on a small timescale. The LUAV and FUAVs collaborate across different timescales to achieve joint trajectory optimization. To tackle the sparse reward problem in existing learning-based trajectory planning algorithms, we introduce an intrinsic curiosity-driven module that integrates historical information to enhance the exploration of the UAV formation in unknown environments. Our algorithm enhances the UAV formation’s capability to handle complex obstacles and maintain the formation, thereby improving overall performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves complete obstacle avoidance with a 100% UAV survival rate. Compared to existing algorithms, our proposed algorithm reduces the trajectory length by 14% and improves the formation maintaining performance by over 90%."

    "abstract": "Adaptive knowledge transfer from pretrained source models to unlabeled target domains has emerged as a key paradigm in the Industrial Internet of Things. Such frameworks effectively mitigate distribution discrepancies between domains and ensure data privacy in cross-condition fault diagnosis. However, most existing methods require extensive parameter tuning for each source backbone, resulting in high computational costs, especially as the number of source domains or the complexity of models increases. Moreover, current methods typically learn the transferable weights of each source model at domain-level, inevitably causing instance-level bias. Thus, we propose a new idea of Specificity and Consistency Ensemble (SpeConE) for efficient multiple-source fault diagnosis, which avoids parameter tuning for each source backbone. SpeConE balances instance-specific and domain-consistent weights by jointly considering feature-feature and feature-output similarities. By fine-tuning the source bottlenecks guided by the specificity and consistency weights, SpeConE effectively achieves multi-source-free cross-domain adaptation. Additionally, a novel pseudo-label smoothing strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting in the target domain. Experiments show that, when adopting Swin Transformer, SpeConE outperforms similar methods (e.g., ∼+3% on single-device diagnosis and ∼+10% on cross-device diagnosis) while tuning only about 5% of the parameters."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution towards the sixth-generation (6G) networks demands advanced beamforming techniques to address challenges in dynamic, high-mobility scenarios, such as vehicular communications. Vision-based beam prediction utilizing RGB camera images emerges as a promising solution for accurate and responsive beam selection. However, reliance on visual data introduces unique vulnerabilities, particularly susceptibility to adversarial attacks, thus potentially compromising beam accuracy and overall network reliability. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic exploration of adversarial threats specifically targeting vision-based mmWave beam selection systems. Traditional white-box attacks are impractical in this context because ground-truth beam indices are inaccessible and spatial dynamics are complex. To address this, we propose a novel black-box adversarial attack strategy, termed Spatial Proxy Attack (SPA), which leverages spatial correlations between user positions and beam indices to craft effective perturbations without requiring access to model parameters or labels. To counteract these adversarial vulnerabilities, we formulate an optimization framework aimed at simultaneously enhancing beam selection accuracy under clean conditions and robustness against adversarial perturbations. We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture integrated with a dedicated Feature Refinement Module (FRM), designed to systematically reshaping irrelevant, noisy and adversarially perturbed visual features. Evaluations using standard backbone models such as ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2 demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves performance, achieving up to an +21.07% gain in Top-K accuracy under clean conditions and up to a +37.32% increase in Top-1 adversarial robustness compared to different baseline models."

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained attention due to their flexible deployment, line-of-sight transmission, and dynamic adaptability. However, UAV-assisted communication encounters challenges stemming from UAV position deviations caused by environmental factors such as wind and turbulence, which degrade transmission reliability. To address these problems, we propose a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access-based full-duplex UAV relay protocol to improve the system transmission rate. The protocol utilizes successive interference cancellation for signal separation and maximal ratio combining for signal enhancement. Considering UAV position uncertainty, we formulate a robust optimization problem for joint UAV position optimization and power allocation. By employing the Bernstein-type inequality, we transform the probabilistic constraints into the deterministic constraints and solve the problem using a block coordinate descent-based algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the benchmark schemes, the proposed strategy improves system throughput and exhibits enhanced robustness, particularly under significant UAV position deviations."

    "abstract": "Artificial heart pumps are important medical devices for treating heart failure. This study investigates the hydraulic performance and blood-assist effects of an artificial heart pump through in vitro blood circulation experiments. First, we present the pump model and its key performance parameters. Next, we establish an in vitro blood circulation experimental platform to evaluate the pump's hydraulic performance, which demonstrates satisfactory results. Finally, we performed blood-assist experiments under conditions of 10% ejection fraction (EF), revealing that at 1200 r/min, cardiac output increases by 51.6% and aortic pressure rises to 80-95 mmHg. This work provides essential reference for structural optimization and performance improvement of artificial heart pumps."
