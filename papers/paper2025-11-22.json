    "abstract": "This article explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as a Service (LLMaaS), a paradigm rapidly transforming the landscape of artificial intelligence. LLMs, a class of foundation models trained on extensive data, offer immense opportunities across diverse applications by generating human-like text and performing complex language tasks. LLMaaS democratizes access to these powerful models, enabling developers and businesses to integrate advanced AI capabilities without managing underlying infrastructure. A core challenge for LLMs, particularly for LLMaaS offerings, is hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect or nonsensical information. Addressing this, initiatives like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) are crucial for enhancing the structure and reliability of LLMaaS. MCP allows LLMs to fetch and cite information from external, real-time sources, directly in their responses. This mechanism significantly enhances truthfulness, providing transparency through verifiable citations and mitigating factual errors. Companies like Anthropic are actively developing MCP, with support from entities such as Microsoft's Windows AI Foundry. The architecture of LLMaaS solutions often leverages sophisticated components, including attention mechanisms fundamental to the underlying LLM architectures. To analyze these aspects, this study combines a structured literature review with the examination of non-commercial academic case studies that integrate LLMaaS into legal assistance and document management systems. The profound impact of LLMaaS lies in its potential to accelerate AI adoption and innovation across industries. However, its successful, responsible deployment hinges on robust solutions for ensuring data provenance, factual accuracy, and explainability. This article is particularly relevant for researchers, developers, educators, policy makers, and emerging businesses, as it delves into the intricate structure of LLMaaS offerings, their broad societal and technological impact, and the critical challenges that must be overcome to realize their full potential, particularly in ensuring reliability and mitigating risks associated with untruthful outputs."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping the methods and efficiency of business communication. Effective communication strategies have become essential for enhancing organizational coordination and customer satisfaction in competitive business environments. This study aims to explore how the use of AI tools and demographic characteristics influence communication behavior and the effectiveness of communication strategies, thereby constructing a theoretical model and practical framework for optimizing business communication in the digital era. Based on questionnaire data, the study employs the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm to systematically identify key variables affecting communication channel preferences, communication risk levels, and the effectiveness of communication strategies. The results show that industry type, age group, and acceptance of AI tools are major predictors of communication channel preferences. The perceived impact of AI plays a central role in determining communication risks, especially when interacting with specific types of communication problems. Among various communication strategies, accurate targeting of clients and expression skills exert the most significant positive effects on strategy effectiveness. Furthermore, the frequency of emotional engagement demonstrates a notable moderating effect on the relationship between communication strategies and their outcomes. This study enriches the theoretical understanding of business communication in the context of AI, and provides empirical evidence and practical guidance for enterprises seeking to develop precise, efficient, and risk-aware communication strategies in the digital age."

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent sophisticated cyberattacks characterized by their ability to remain undetected within the victim system for extended periods, aiming to exfiltrate sensitive data or disrupt operations. Existing detection approaches often struggle to effectively identify these complex threats, construct the attack chain for defense facilitation, or resist adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Slot, an advanced APT detection approach based on provenance graphs and graph reinforcement learning. Slot excels in uncovering multi-level hidden relationships, such as causal, contextual, and indirect connections, among system behaviors through provenance graph mining. Slot implements semi-supervised learning with limited labels through efficient label similarity computation, significantly enhancing both detection performance and model robustness. By pioneering the integration of graph reinforcement learning, Slot dynamically adapts to new user activities and evolving attack strategies, enhancing its resilience against adversarial attacks. Additionally, Slot automatically constructs the attack chain according to detected attacks with clustering algorithms, providing precise identification of attack paths and facilitating the development of defense strategies. Evaluations with real-world datasets demonstrate Slot's outstanding accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and robustness in APT detection, with most metrics surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, case studies conducted to assess Slot's effectiveness in supporting APT defense further establish it as a practical and reliable tool for cybersecurity protection."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeGuider, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, SafeGuider generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems."

Our work uses advanced short secret sharing techniques and optimized rejection sampling to balance communication and correctness in distributed settings. We implement our construction in Go and benchmark it in local, LAN, and WAN deployments. Results show that our threshold ML-DSA is both practical and compatible with real-world applications such as multi-device cryptocurrency wallets, threshold TLS, and Tor's directory authorities."

To prevent such abuse, developers need to secure a11y content access in both their apps and mobile websites. However, a misalignment of a11y protection mechanisms exists between them. Prior research has focused on attacking and defending a11y information embedded in native Android apps. However, our research found that a11y malware can retrieve app-protected a11y information in its mobile browser-rendered website counterpart, leaving mobile browser users more vulnerable to a11y attacks than app users. To help benign service developers vet this attack surface, we developed SOMBRA, an automated analysis pipeline to vet browser-side leakage of a11y information that is a11y-protected in apps. Using SOMBRA, we analyzed 294 benign services and found 29 of them deploy app-side a11y protection mechanisms to secure 256 views. SOMBRA discovered that 241, 402, 244, and 251 elements corresponding to their protected app-side views are a11y-exposed in their websites rendered by Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge browsers, respectively. The leaked elements contain sensitive personal identifiable information. Finally, SOMBRA discovered that most developers do not adopt browser-side a11y protections because existing mechanisms either have ineffective protection or hinder the usability of their content."

Based on survey data from 832 residents in Yunnan Province, China, we employed structural equation modeling to examine relationships among low-carbon awareness, knowledge, norms, and practice. Results reveal that external factors exert the strongest influence on low-carbon practice (β=0.401, r=0.452), followed by personal norms (β=0.217) and social norms (β=0.117), with knowledge showing a stronger impact than awareness on personal norms. Multi-group analysis demonstrates significant demographic variations, particularly stronger norm effects among women and younger residents. The Random Forest model validates the theoretical framework with high predictive accuracy (R²=0.773), confirming that selected variables explain 77.3% of variance in low-carbon practice. This integration provides robust evidence for understanding the cognitive-behavioral gap and offers reliable support for developing targeted sustainable lifestyle promotion strategies."

The results show that corporate environmental responsibility inconsistency between words and deeds is significantly negatively correlated with standard audit opinions; The predictive performance of the XGBoosting model is compared with that of the Logit model, the results show that the XGBoosting model achieves a higher accuracy rate and AUC value, indicating its superior performance in predicting audit opinions. The heterogeneity test shows that the impact of corporate environmental responsibility inconsistency on audit opinion is more significant in companies with a higher level of big data application. The mechanism test shows that the inconsistency between words and deeds of corporate environmental responsibility will negatively affect the issuance of standard audit opinions by increasing earnings management and audit input."

We instantiate Peekaboo over the SOTA attacks, Sap (USENIX' 21) and Jigsaw (USENIX' 24), to derive their ''+'' variants (Sap+ and Jigsaw+). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design achieves &gt;0.9 adjusted rand index for search pattern recovery and ∼90% query accuracy vs. FMA's ∼30% (CCS' 23). Peekaboo's accuracy scales with observation rounds and the number of observed queries but also it resists SOTA countermeasures, with &gt;40% accuracy against file size padding and &gt;80% against obfuscation."

    "abstract": "The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose Sylva, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a two-phase process. In Phase 1, Sylva employs LoRA for local adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sylva can achieve up to 50× improvements in communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5% and 50.4% enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively."

To address this gap, we present JsDeObsBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the context of JS deobfuscation. We detail our benchmarking methodology, which includes a wide range of obfuscation techniques ranging from basic variable renaming to sophisticated structure transformations, providing a robust framework for assessing LLM performance in real-world scenarios. Our extensive experimental analysis investigates the proficiency of cutting-edge LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o, Mixtral, Llama, and DeepSeek-Coder, revealing superior performance in code simplification despite challenges in maintaining syntax accuracy and execution reliability compared to baseline methods. We further evaluate the deobfuscation of JS malware to exhibit the potential of LLMs in security scenarios. The findings highlight the utility of LLMs in deobfuscation applications and pinpoint crucial areas for further improvement."

A crucial reason behind the success of the syzkaller is its collection of syscall descriptions, which are typically provided by human experts. Although some methods exist for automatically generating these syscall descriptions for device drivers, they often fall short when dealing with complex user inputs. These existing methods either lack precision or have a limited analysis scope, resulting in incomplete syscall descriptions."

Weight plaintext, weight in RNS-CKKS format, can reach tens to hundreds of gigabytes. Existing compression methods either add high computational cost or yield low compression rates. In this work, we propose WPC, Weight Plaintext Compression, to compress weight plaintext for RNS-CKKS-based CNN inference. We observe that the transformation from the weight in CNN models to the weight plaintext in RNS-CKKS format involves an operation akin to the Discrete Fourier Transform, which shifts data between the time and frequency domains while retaining redundant information from periodic and discrete data. Based on this observation, we first introduce the Periodic Transmit Theorem, which states that periodic patterns can be preserved during the transformation process, thereby enabling compression. We then propose Channel Innermost Packing Scheme and Rotation Padding to rearrange the weight data into periodic patterns for compression. Results show that WPC achieves 1.25 to 2.18 times speedup on an A100 GPU and 46.08 to 139.11 times compression rate."

    "abstract": "The ability of a machine to store numbers and perform calculations on them is fundamental to computing. Many novice and expert users wrongly assume that number representation is a long-solved problem. Modern computers use binary encodings, and nothing more needs to be said, right? Wrong! For example, irrational numbers like pi are approximated; rational numbers like 2.0 may overflow when multiplied by a larger number; and (1/x)*x should equal 1.0 but often does not! Modern floating point evolved rather than being designed!"

However, systems that require verification or monitoring by a third party to ensure compliance with a specification might contain sensitive information, causing privacy concerns when usual runtime verification approaches are used. Privacy is compromised if protected information about the system, or sensitive data that is processed by the system, is revealed. In addition, revealing the specification being monitored may undermine the essence of third-party verification."

To protect sensitive data processed by GPUs, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for GPUs have been proposed. GPU TEEs, built with hardware-based isolation primitives, can defend against high-privilege attackers like OS kernels. However, in this paper, we present MOLE, a novel attack that compromises the security of GPU TEEs on Arm Mali GPUs by exploiting the GPU-embedded Microcontroller Unit (MCU). By injecting malicious firmware into the MCU, an attacker can bypass GPU TEEs' security guarantees. We evaluated MOLE with state-of-the-art GPU TEE proposals under multiple real-world attack scenarios, such as in-GPU AES encryption and object detection tasks. Our evaluation shows that MOLE can successfully extract sensitive data or manipulate the computation results of GPU TEEs. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the authors of the affected GPU TEE proposals and received acknowledgments from all of them. Moreover, our findings prompted Arm to enhance the security of its GPU firmware supply chains."

    "abstract": "Microarchitectural side-channel attacks, which have become increasingly prevalent, often rely on high-resolution timers. Emerging processor architectures have sought to mitigate these vulnerabilities by restricting access to fine-grained timers. In this work, we verify the widespread existence of weak coherence in L1 cache on multiple RISC chips, exploit it to bypass this type of mitigation and propose GhostCache, which constructs timer-free and counter-free instruction cache attacks. It introduces two novel and widely applied attack primitives, Modify+Recall and Call+ModifyCall, which are applicable to both RISC-V and ARM architectures and affect 6 commercial and 3 open-source large RISC processors. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of timer-free and counter-free cache attacks on RISC-V processors. We also identify undisclosed features, such as the next-three-line prefetching mechanism and direct forwarding of evicted instructions from data cache to instruction cache. Furthermore, we develop four types of covert channels, achieving up to 1.68 MB/s with a 0.01% error rate. For side-channel attacks, GhostCache enables three types of timer-free real-world attacks. The first is an end-to-end website fingerprinting attack, achieving 92.02% accuracy across 100 website classes. The second is a set of kernel leakage attacks, including the discovery of a new Spectre disclosure gadget via a function pointer to leak arbitrary kernel data at 92.91% accuracy. We also launched an attack to reconstruct cryptographic keys. Lastly, we propose potential countermeasures to address these vulnerabilities in both RISC-V and ARM architectures."

We also resolve the security issue of presigning pointed out by Groth and Shoup (Eurocrypt '22), evading a security loss that increases with the number of pre-released, unused presignatures, for the first time among threshold-optimal schemes. Our construction builds on Non-Interactive Multiplication (NIM), a notion proposed by Boyle et al. (PKC '25), which allows parties to evaluate multiplications on secret-shared values in one round. In particular, we use the construction of Abram et al. (Eurocrypt '24) instantiated with class groups. The setup is minimal and transparent, consisting of only two class-group generators. The signing protocol is efficient in bandwidth, with a message size of 1.9 KiB at 128-bit security, and has competitive computational performance."

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of global crude oil trade, traditional prediction methods have difficulty capturing the spatiotemporal characteristics of trade flows. This paper proposes a global crude oil trade flow prediction method based on a graph neural network (GNN). The crude oil trade network is modeled using a dynamic heterogeneous graph, and a spatiotemporal joint modeling is performed by combining a graph convolution network (GCN), a graph attention network (GAT), and a temporal convolution network (TCN). This method can simultaneously capture the spatial dependence and temporal dynamics of trade flows, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions. A series of experiments have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the model when processing large-scale crude oil trade data, especially in the face of data imbalance and abnormal value interference, the model still maintains good prediction ability. The research in this paper provides a new way of thinking for the prediction of crude oil trade flows and provides a useful reference for modeling complex spatio-temporal networks."

    "abstract": "This study explores the emerging roles of global tax advisory firms in the digital transformation of tax administration (DTA)—a rapidly evolving frontier of digital government where the influence of external actors remains underexamined. As national governments increasingly turn to firms like the Big Four to modernize tax systems, the diverse modes through which these actors engage have yet to be conceptually mapped or empirically explored in depth. Using a qualitative, exploratory research design, we analyze five expert interviews, more than fifty policy documents, and digital archival materials to identify five provisional mechanisms of influence: strategic positioning, reform brokerage, platform standardization, knowledge translation, and soft power accumulation. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives – including transaction cost economics, public choice theory, the resource-based view of the firm, and New Public Governance – we find that tax advisory firms operate not only as service vendors but as embedded reform actors who shape policy content, mediate stakeholder agendas, and contribute to the institutionalization of reform logic across diverse governance contexts. These findings offer early empirical insight into how state authority is co-produced in digital reforms and raise questions about capacity, consultant dependency, and accountability in consultant-led governance arrangements."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the rapid development of big data technology, the phenomenon of price discrimination, colloquially known as \"big data-enabled price gouging,\" has sparked widespread social concern and a crisis of consumer trust. To investigate this issue and seek solutions, this study combines traditional empirical analysis with cutting-edge machine learning simulation. First, through questionnaire surveys and regression analysis, and based on equity theory and price sensitivity theory, we verify the direct negative impact of big data-driven price discrimination on customer loyalty, revealing the mediating role of perceived unfairness and the moderating role of price sensitivity. Second, based on these empirical results, we construct a high-fidelity market simulation environment and employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to train a dynamic pricing agent. The agent's objective is to maximize long-term profit while maintaining customer loyalty. The simulation results show that the trained reinforcement learning strategy significantly outperforms both myopic greedy pricing and fixed-price strategies in terms of total revenue and customer retention. The final policy learned by the agent confirms that to maintain long-term customer relationships, it is necessary to offer discounts to price-sensitive, low-loyalty users while adopting moderate pricing for high-loyalty users, thereby effectively validating our initial theoretical hypotheses. This study not only reveals the internal mechanism through which price discrimination affects customer loyalty but also provides a scientific basis and practical path for enterprises to optimize pricing and achieve sustainable development using advanced algorithms."

As this trend continues, memory resources are poised to become fully composable in the near future. This increasing flexibility also accelerates the demand for effective tiered memory systems capable of performing well across diverse scenarios and workloads. However, the effectiveness of existing tiered memory systems heavily depends on system configuration (e.g., the ratio of fast tier to capacity tier), memory access patterns, and page sizes (base vs. huge). Their reliance on simple heuristics and static thresholds for detecting page hotness, and limited consideration of page sizes, results in suboptimal (often pathological) page placement decisions. To build a robust and effective system, tiered memory management must holistically account for overall memory access patterns in conjunction with the tiering environment."

The result is that deployed authentication algorithms rely on data that overtly leaks private information about the biometric; thus systems rely on externalized security measures such as trusted execution environments."

    "abstract": "Malicious PDF files have emerged as a persistent threat and become a popular attack vector in web-based attacks. While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, these approaches fail to fundamentally resolve the issue of feature instability. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for PDF feature extraction and PDF malware detection. We introduce the PDFObj IR (PDF Object Intermediate Representation), an assembly-like language framework for PDF objects, from which we extract semantic features using a pretrained language model. Additionally, we construct an Object Reference Graph to capture structural features, drawing inspiration from program analysis. This dual approach enables us to analyze and detect PDF malware based on both semantic and structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed classifier achieves strong adversarial robustness while maintaining an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.07% on baseline dataset compared to state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers."

Specifically, our design permits oblivious computation of the LWR-based pseudorandom function Fsk(x) = ⌉ H(x)⊤ ⋅ sk ⌋q,p, for random oracle H: {0,1} * → ℤ qn and uniformly chosen sk∈ {0,1} n. For 128-bits of semi-honest security, the Pool OPRF has an online communication cost of 11.9 kB, and a computational runtime of less than 3 ms on a single thread (via an open-source software implementation). This is more efficient (in either online communication cost or runtime) than constructions from well-known PQ PRFs, and is competitive even with constructions that only conjecture PQ security on lesser-known assumptions. As a result, our design gives high-performance, post-quantum variants of established OPRF applications in multi-party computation and private set operation protocols."

Similarly, digital identity protocols require stronger properties than unforgeability -—specifically, extractability for security proofs when adversaries can observe other users' credentials."
